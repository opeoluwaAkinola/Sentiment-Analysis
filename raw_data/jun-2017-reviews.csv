 one great big huge high-five--from my cat !!!,5,"My cat LOVES Fancy Feast cat food; and this variety pack in particular makes mealtime a veritable newsworthy event! He always eats it down and he loves it; I can tell. You get eight cans of Ocean Whitefish & Tuna Feast; eight more cans of Savory Salmon Feast with Cod and eight more cans still of Sole & Shrimp Feast. Very good! The food does have some nutritional content; I always look for that when I buy food for the cat. There's some vitamin E, A, D3, B12, and B1. I like that. Naturally, ask your vet if you have any concerns about your cat's personal individual needs for nutritional content in their daily diet. If you catch a sale on this, stock up! However, I would use these cans of food within six months of buying them. Overall, this is one of the better brands of cat food out there; and I recommend it. Your cat will love it and it has nutritional content which is great for them, too. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Best thing since Sliced Bread....Awesome !!!,5,"I am not a big fan of fruit roll-ups as they tend to be more like candy than fruit with added sugar. These Twisted Fruit ropes are a ""whole"" other story. They are Organic and provide ONE FULL Serving of Fruit! Each one is 70 calories and best of it, they are satisfying. And I love its dense, chewy texture. It's SO GOOD that I enjoy it as much as my children do ! So far, I have had the pleasure of trying the strawberry, sour apple, and tropical fruit twists. I love them all although the sour apple is indeed ""sour"". It will make your mouth pucker which I personally love but I buy the strawberry & tropical flavors for my children. I just wish that they were less expensive but I can see how they cost more to produce so I am willing to pay more to get a better, more nutritious fruit snack ! Btw, Superstore has the best prices on these esp. if you ""subscribe and save"". They are not yet readily available and at my Whole Foods Supermarket, they sell for 99 cents EACH ! …",39 out of 40 users found this review helpful

 ALMOST A DOLLAR A CUP????!!!!!!!!!,1,"BUYERS BEWARE - I guess it's my fault I really thought when I ordered this coffee I was gettinng TWO BOXES of coffee for 22.50 like almost every other coffee dealer on Superstore sells this stuff for. But this guy sells this coffee for 22.50 for ONE!!!!! box of coffee.When it arrived at my house I asked my wife where the other box was and she said: ""Thats It just one box arrived!"" I looked my order over and sure enough he does sell it for 1 box of coffee for 22.50 making this probably the MOST expensive k-cup coffee on Superstore. So shame on me for not looking the order over before I purchased it. If you look at all the other sellers, their coffee is 23.00 for TWO BOXES OF 25 count k-cups. Thats 50 k-cups. This guy only gives you 25 k-cups for 22.50 which is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!!!!! congratulations you fooled me, but I hope this review warns others off. …",31 out of 48 users found this review helpful
 Makes terrific Dark Rye,5,"My family enjoys good dark rye. I followed the package directions (just add three tablespoons of molasses and three tablespoons of powdered cocoa) and made the best dark rye we have ever eaten. Three cheers for Hodgson Mill.

 Absolutely the BEST!,5,"I have tried many olive oils and this olive oil is absolutely the best olive oil I have ever tasted. More and more while watching food/cooking programs that are actually filmed in Italy, and especially Sicily, it is this olive oil I see on the table. The other reviewers are correct when they state Mario Batali uses it, as I have seen him use this oil on many occasions. The price is a little higher than some, but when used on fresh bread, or a little over Minestrone, or poured over fresh pasta dishes will make you a believer too. …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 I Agree With A. Leahy,1,"Although I'm not a former disgruntled employee, I have developed some reservations about ""San Marzano"" brand tomatoes. When I bought my first can of these tomoatoes at my local grocery store, I thought, great San Marzano plum tomatoes stright from Italy for under $3 for a 28oz can! Then when I got the can home and opened it, the tomatoes inside didn't look like the ones on the can. They were round, and didn't look like plum tomatoes, which resemble little eggplants. Further, after reading the label, I realized these tomatoes are from California, and have nothing to do with the San Marzano reigon of Italy at all. What a dissapointment! Buyer beware: these tomatoes are not from San Marzano, and probably aren't even plum tomatoes! As for taste, it was OK, but definately I was left wondering 'where's the great, sweet, fresh flavor people say San Marzano tomatoes should have?' If you are looking for an average tomato this brand should suffice, but if you want the real San Marzano tomatoes, please save youself the dissapointment and keep looking. …",15 out of 18 users found this review helpful
" Healthy, delicious, and at a decent price.",5,"I love ""Food for Life Ezekiel"" products. Originally, I was introduced to the bread when on a special diet -- an offshoot program of ""Over-eaters Anonymous"", the H.O.W. program -- many years ago. The bread contains NO flour, no sugar, is high in protein and fiber, and, for my taste, is delicious. Actually, I learned that OVER-eating was not really my problem. My problem was NOT eating the healthiest, life-giving, minimally processed foods available. Over time, I learned, relapsed, and relearned, etc. I was thrilled when I learned ""Food for Life"" added cereals to their product line. In looking at labels at my local health food store, I discovered that this brand was the ONLY cold cereal on the shelves that had NO sugar content! Since then, this is the ONLY cold cereal I buy. It can be served warm, as well. Generally, though, I prefer ""John McCann's Steel-Cut Irish Oatmeal"" (also zero sugar and high fiber) for hot cereal. Needless to say, the cereal is expensive (but cheap if you consider that you're no longer polluting your body with all the sugar, air, preservatives, and other junk in most commercial cereals), so I was thrilled to find that Superstore offered it in a 6-box bundle for a far better price than my local market. I usually have a bowl a day with fresh berries (strawberries are very sweet this year in my area) and slivered almonds topped with light soy milk. I find that when I'm eating really nutritious food, I eat slowly and savor. When I'm eating junk, I tend to ""wolf"" it down. It doesn't matter why. I just hate that sensation, so I avoid it and my body thanks me every day. …",32 out of 33 users found this review helpful

 Don't Be Without a Buster Cube!,5,I bought a mini buster cube for my miniature dachshund to help build up his rear leg muscles a few months after he had back surgery. All I had to do was put a few pieces of his dry dog food in it and he figured it out quick. It's 7 years later and it's still his favorite toy. He can even pick it up with his mouth and carry it around the house. He puts it in his dog house and bangs it around for hours. He literally plays by himself and keeps busy all day in the yard too. He doesn't even care that I stopped putting food in it years ago. I had a few of these break after wear from the rocks in my last yard but I keep about 5 at a time in my house in case the company decides not to make them anymore. I bought one for my friend's pomeranian and he doesn't stop playing with it either. He now has two. …,39 out of 39 users found this review helpful

" Great product, can get cheaper at Target - CHECK FOR RECALLED POUCHES!",4,"We love Happy Tots food. My 12 month old has tried many varieties and loves them all. He has not had one sour face yet! I'm surprised at the price here, you can get this item at Target for $1.09 per pouch which is much less expensive. I guess buying it online is helpful for people who don't have access to a Target or Health food store, and in that case, is worth the price. *** as a special precaution *** A baby food recall just issued by the FDA (Jan. 2010) may have some of the most stomach-churning details I've read in awhile: ""Swollen or leaking pouches may indicate problems with the product, including possible contamination by bacteria that can cause illness, or that the packaging has been compromised and is at risk of bacterial contamination."" The recalled food is made by Happy Baby, and it's a mix of the baby and toddler lines that parents should be throwing out. The recall covers: * HAPPYTOT Green bean, pear & peas, NET WT. 4.22 OZ.

 Warning: Contains Menadione,1,"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex. Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance. Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption. A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997. Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells. Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats. …",20 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 PLEASE I implore you to do research before buying Blue Agave!,1,"Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food. Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener. All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as High Fructose Corn Syrup!!!! Based on the labeling, I could picture native peoples creating their own agave nectar from the wild agave plants. Surely, this was a traditional food, eaten for thousands of years. Sadly, it is not. Native Mexican peoples do make a sort of sweetener out of the agave plant. It's called miel de agave, and it's made by boiling the agave sap for a couple of hours. Think of it as the Mexican version of authentic Canadian maple syrup. But this is not what agave nectar is. According to one popular agave nectar manufacturer, ""Agave nectar is a newly created sweetener, having been developed in the 1990s."" In a recent article now posted on the Weston A. Price foundation's website, Ramiel Nagel and Sally Fallon Morell write, Agave ""nectar"" is not made from the sap of the yucca or agave plant but from the starch of the giant pineapple-like, root bulb. The principal constituent of the agave root is starch, similar to the starch in corn or rice, and a complex carbohydrate called inulin, which is made up of chains of fructose molecules.Technically a highly indigestible fiber, inulin, which does not taste sweet, comprises about half of the carbohydrate content of agave. The process by which agave glucose and inulin are converted into ""nectar"" is similar to the process by which corn starch is converted into HFCS. The agave starch is subject to an enzymatic and chemical process that converts the starch into a fructose-rich syrup--anywhere from 70 percent fructose and higher according to the agave nectar chemical profiles posted on agave nectar websites. ""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"". Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you. If you simply must have some sweets, a small amount of agave nectar every once in a while isn't going to kill you. Just don't buy into the idea that it's any better for you than plain old sugar or HFCS. Info is taken from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S. So please. I implore each and every one of you to do your own research on this sham of a product and tell everyone you know. Write letters and let the world know that we won't fall prey to loopholes in ""Organic Marketing"". The fact that so many people use this because they are diabetic is quite frightening. …",130 out of 156 users found this review helpful
 Do Not Buy - Doesn't Work,1,"I really wanted this to work. It looks nice and is a little more narrow than some of the other K-cup drawers. First of all this says it holds 35, but the box it came in says it holds only holds 30. That is not the problem. It looks very nice, I like the material on top, BUT the entire thing slips and slides. The Keurig (B70) slides on top even with a full water reserve. When you pull the drawer the entire drawer, Keurig and all slides as well. That's not the worst part, however, I could get past that and use rubber shelf lining to fix that issue. The worst part that you cannot fix is the fact that even with LESS than 30 K-cups in this drawer it WILL NOT OPEN. The K-cups in the middle column get stuck and jammed due to a metal rod along the top of that column. The K-cups on the ends get stuck on the metal pieces that bend over the top of the columns. This will RUIN your k-cups as they get snagged and pressed by the metal. It took me several minutes to remove K-cups that jammed in the drawer and the drawer would not open. AWFUL. Completely unusable and worthless. I returned this product and instead bought a larger one with rubber mat on top that slides easily (from Bed Bath and Beyond for $20 w/ 20% off coupon. Cheaper, holds more, slides easier, doesn't damage k-cups and won't slide off your counter. …",14 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",19 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 To offset the 1 star reviews,5,"I was looking to see if this pet food was cheaper on Superstore than it is at my local pet store (it is) and I saw the 1-star reviews and was shocked. I understand that people are having issues with the listing versus what they get in the mail but that has nothing to do with the product itself, which is what you should be reviewing here, maybe with a disclaimer in the review of the food about the mix-up. Superstore is where I go for reviews of products and notes on shipping mix-ups hardly ever tell me what I need to know! That being said, I love Merrick Before Grain. When I adopted my little strays they were living in the zoo and surviving off of raw ground meat and fish, so when I brought them home I chose a grain grain free food because I thought it would be the easiest transition on their stomachs from what they were eating. I've also done some pet nutrition research of my own, and while I'll concede that cats can process nutrients from grains in their foods, it just doesn't seem right to me that they many pet foods have most of the protein coming from vegetable sources, so I stayed grain-free even after the initial adoption. Recently, though, my budget has gotten tighter and I'm close to a ramen budget and decided my cats would have to be put on a ramen diet, too. I did the gradual transition to a new food the way you're supposed to, a little at a time, and the cats didn't seem to mind the change at all. As soon as the cheaper food took over, though, one of my cats started having terrible gas and had some minor tummy troubles. That bag is just about through so I'm going to start the transition back to this food. A big bag of this food ended up cost less per-pound than smaller bags of lower-quality foods, anyway, so I decided the additional cost was worth it. There are also several more expensive brands (Wellness, Blue Buffalo) that have grain in their cat food formulas, unless you opt for their grain-free variety which is even more. Merrick offers the grain-free choice without being the most expensive option out there, and is even comparable in price to many brands that have lower-quality ingredients. All-in-all, definitely worth a try! The canned foods are great, too, but my cats have decided they only like wet foods that are in gravies and won't eat the pates Merrick has. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 How Could You Be So Bold,5,"After FINALLY purchasing best coffee maker I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Superstore, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold. Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold. What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's. There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Superstore. Wake up people, and add this to your cart.

 Be sure to order appropriate size,4,"I am obsessed with researching stuff and I was nervous about ordering such a spendy dog toy. I am very happy I did! I originally purchased a small for my 10 lb wire fox terrier puppy (chews on EVERYTHING-he's teething), after getting it home I realized how some folks would have problems w/their dog popping out the treats too fast. IMO, order the largest size your dog can have fun with. I exchanged the small for a medium and it's worked out great. This way, he can't get his jaws around it and he can't pop the treats out-he just licks it to death, rolls it everywhere and growls at it b/c he can't get to the treats-which is the whole point of the toy.

 A nice 'get acquainted' variety pack,5,"I have been trying to replace my former supplier of single-origin coffee (which raised its shipping prices five fold!) here on Superstore, without too much luck up until now. Can't say I didn't try. I have 20 lbs of coffee; sinlge origin beans I love, BUT the roaster has maybe gone to roasting more than they can handle? The beans taste burnt, leave a bitter after taste. I had some qualms about ordering from coffee masters given the number of flavored coffees they carry, which generally indicates either inferior beans, or that they are producing for a clientele which does not know coffee. Because of this I was wary of ordering and got this sampler, *hoping*, as noone had yet described the contents, that it would not contain any flavored coffee. and, I am happy to report, it does not. For those of you as baffled as I as to what is in the box, here it is: Brazilian Santos Columbian Huila Costa rican Terrazu Ethiopian (Mocha) Harrar ""euro Espresso"" blend French roast blend Guatamalan ""Amatitlan"" Hawaiian blend Kenya AA Louisiana blend Mexican ""Coatepec"" Sumatra Mandheeling Thus far i have only tried 2; the Ethiopian and thr Brazillian Santos, and, overall i am impressed, It is beyond the shadow of a doubt the best of what I have purchased on Superstore, and I have read dozens and dozens of reviews to avoid getting another 5,10, 15 pound of mediocre burned coffee. While the Ethiopian was not the very best I have had, it is right up there. The Brazilian really surprised me. I basically never buy light roast, do not like ""weak"" coffee, but this was most excellent; not weak but smooth, full, well rounded. I am off to change my subscriptions. I think I have found myself a roaster here at last! and, now that I know what they can do will be ordering the whole bean., which I expect to be better still.

" Gluten free, vegan, kosher, and very concentrated.",5,"O.k., so it's not officially kosher--but this is how you make gelatin without cow's hooves, for those of you who get grossed out by Jell-O if you think about it too much. Now foods is a company that sells gluten-free stuff, and this is no exception: if you have celiac this won't make you sick. Even better, this is powdered agar agar, not flaked agar agar. That means this will last for months, if not years--although it's also easy to use too much. 1 tablespoon of the flakes = 1/2 tsp of the powder. The ratio most cooks call for is 1 cup liquid to 1 teaspoon flaked agar agar, which means 1/4 tsp of this powder to 1 cup liquid, with more added for more acidic things like orange juice. However, agar agar doesn't gel as well as Jell-o, so don't expect to get the same results that you would for Jell-o--for that, you need Jell-o or kosher gelatin. (You can add more agar agar to add firmness; but then it starts to taste like what it is: seaweed.) …",31 out of 31 users found this review helpful
 Call me a convert,5,"I was frightened by my breakfast today. Vegemite on buttered toast. Yes, I had researched the traditional way to eat it. But still... I was scared. I faced my fear. I opened the jar. I stared down the thick, dark, brown, gooey goo. I took a spoon and took control. I spooned out a tiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnny bit. Tiny. I put it on the edge of my toast. I made a face. I took a bite. I smiled. In dismay. In pleasure. I picked up the spoon again and commanded the brown goo to give me more more more. Well, still sparingly, but, nevertheless... more. I used no more than 1/2 teaspoon on my slice of toast. I had a second slice with another almost 1/2 teaspoon. I updated my Facebook status. People replied in curiosity, in fellowship or in disgust. Or all of the above. About an hour later I craved it again, and I indulged again. Between waking and dinnertime, three slices with that just-less-than-one-half-teaspoonful of Vegemite was all I consumed, and, I swear, I was pleasantly satiated all day and full of energy. Can't wait until breakfast tomorrow! :) (Standard disclaimer: I've been vegetarian for almost 18 years. This had an almost beefy taste. Salty, beefy, vegan, lots of B vitamins. Yum.) …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Vino Italiano - A Quality Economy Wine Kit,5,"This is my third Vino Italiano kit and I made a double batch of this Tuscany Rosso Magnifico to fill a 40 liter oak barrel I have ... I want to give this kit every opportunity to shine. It's going to be my ""house table wine"" to enjoy with everyday meals while I wait for some of my upper end wine kits to fully mature. A couple of hints to better appreciate these Vino Italiano wine kits: 1. Have realistic expectations. These kits make a nice light to medium-bodied wine. Beautifully red and brilliant in the glass, they are light and food friendy wines (and not necessarily great representations of their varietal). But if you're expecting something full-bodied and inky dark like a Napa Cabernet, you're setting yourself up to be disappointed. Keep in mind, this bottle of wine cost you $1.50 to make. (The cost of bottles doesn't count ... you can reuse them over and over - stay green!) 2. These wines will improve with time in the bottle. While it's hard to resist dipping into your supply for weekly tastings, six months to a year in the bottle will make for a much nicer, less green-tasting wine. I'll add more to this review after I bottle this wine, but I will say that it is drinking better than the Valpolicella did at this early stage. Less dry than the Valpolicella with a nice balance of both fruit and tannins. I think I'll be proud to call this Rosso Magnifico my ""house red."" …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 This one supplement has changed my life!,5,"I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.) None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life. That is, until Natural Calm. This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically! Here are the things this supplement has helped with: Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night. Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations. Mood--- Made me generally happier. Decreased muscle cramping and soreness. Improved gums and teeth. Improved hair loss. Improved digestion and transit time. Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too! But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really. There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Superstore if you want more science of magnesium.) I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement. If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want. Here's wishing you great health! …",219 out of 263 users found this review helpful

We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase.

 OK stuff if used within reason.,4,"First, I'm not sure why it's called ""oil"": it's butter, not oil; it's solid w/o refrigeration. The consistency is translucent sorta clunky white, sorta like grated candle would look. Just like butter, it immediately melts in your hand or mouth, to say nothing of the frying pan. Smells great, tastes also nice: like, well, coconut. Supposedly it's great for cooking due to its supposedly higher heat-resistance something: it's supposed to keep its nutritional qualities when heated better than other common cooking oils. There's a rub though: with many foods you can mix and match and achieve some sort of mixed flavour -- not with this stuff! It's irrepressible: whatever you add it to -- veggies, cakes, meat, cardboard, or motor oil -- will then smell/taste like coconut and nothing beside. It overpowers every other flavour. So the only cooking variables you have left when using it is texture and sweetness (and looks, I guess). It goes very well with something that's sweet (probably because we're used to coconut being used in sweets). From what I've tried, it goes well with carrots, apples, sunflower seeds (anything nutty-tasting), stuff like that. Real good with sweet potatoes. But I would not recommed using it for cooking meat (unless you like your pork chops smelling and tasting like coconut). You can't kill this flavour, that's what I'm getting at. I'm using it carefully (not too much and in suitable combinations) and I'm happy with it so far. The product seems good, and so is the price (Added on 12/18/2010: that was the price at the time of purchase, $13.54 on Dec 2, 2010 -- and now, only two weeks later, the price on this page is $18.46, amazing, no? A 30% increase in two weeks, wow, these guys sure are optimistic about the value of their product). A bit of a warning: there's a megaton of unsubstantiated semi-literate BS online about miraculous powers of coconut oil. Be careful about it: coconut oil is pure saturated fat (a serving consists of 14 grams of fat, 13 of them saturated) -- and I've found no acceptable medical/scientific info in support of the healthfulness of saturated fat (while there's a lot on the opposite). What I did find was that it's not openly harmful when used in small doses: a healthy 200-lbs 40-sh male, not overweight and exercising regularly, is allowed 200 saturated-fat calories a day. A serving of coconut oil is 130 calories, but of course, you'll get saturated fats from other foods too. Another thing is that coconut oil contains no appreciable amounts of vitamins/minerals (unlike butter, which is _loaded_ with all kinds of goodies). So be careful: despite the squall of shilling on the net and in print, it's not health food. But it's tasty and not like lethally bad, so... ------- Added on 12/18/2010: I'm half-way through the first jar, and I find myself using it less and less. It's too smelly, and I just don't have that much opportunity to use it for stuff where it's OK. Besides being food, it is supposedly also good for external use, for skin and hair; I haven't tried it this way (yet; maybe I will). But I have a feeling that _as food_ it doesn't have much of a future in this household: it's too overpowering, too particular. ----- 01/01/2011: Tried it for skin lotion: well, um, yes and no. No: it doesn't get absorbed into the skin, and the area of application stays greasy forever, so you can't do it before going out (even wiping with, say, paper towel, doesn't remove enough of it, so you'll stain the clothes with oil). Yes: it has a terrific staying power, hours and several hand washes after application there's still something remaining on the skin. And I work with my hands a lot, with the result that they tend to get real dirty, so I wash hands frequently and rather severely, the surgical way: very hot water, several soap-ups, brush. This causes severe dehydration of the skin, so I've always used hand lotion immediately after, but with coconut oil the skin remains slightly oiled, soft and moisturised even after a couple of such washes. So, finally: I'm not sure how (and whether) I'll continue to use coconut oil: I have definitely ceased to use it as food; as moisturiser we'll see... at least it's marginally cheaper than dry-skin cream so I'll give it a longer try. But the cream dries up in a minute, so it's more practicable, I must say. Doesn't smell of coconut either! :-) I must say I did not find the product as useful as it's hyped, so I'm taking one star off right now. I'll revisit in a month or two: if I discover by then that I've stopped using this thing altogether, I'll update the review to this effect. -------- 02/20/2011: Bottom line: I think I've settled into a two-sided routine with this oil: I use it, first, for light-frying/sauteing veggies (with yams or sweet potatoes as a basis; adding greens, like spinach, in the mix later on). I don't do this often though, 'cause I prefer to steam or eat raw, rather than fry anything; sauteing is quicker though, so when I'm pressed for time, this is workable. The other use is for skin: skin really loves this oil -- in addition to staying hydrated forever, it becomes very even in texture and colour; after shower I grease myself up, literally from head to toe, and it's just lovely (except for the clothes who get stained :-). …",5 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 A delicious treat,5,"Well, since some other user decided they'd paste their review on to each flavor allow me to give my short but sweet review: MiO is delicious. I like that I can just put in the tiniest of splashes in my drink and just have a hint of flavor... or splash a lot in and get a real flavorful experience. It's a quick and easy thing to use. It's also fun to watch it splash into the water. I've also found it's good to flavor different types of alcohol. In regards to the criticism by other reviewers for it containing propylene glycol - don't be in a panic like them. propylene glycol is harmless unless ingest massive quantities of it. Using a canard like ""it's considered harmful to pets so humans shouldn't ingest it!"" is just alarmist behavior. Chocolate is harmful to dogs. Better not eat that then! Lastly, in regards to it having so many ""food colorings"" - well, if you don't like anything that flavors your water to have anything artificial in it, squeeze a lemon into it. Put a dash of sugar. Or just drink the water plain. You know what you're getting into when you buy this stuff. Bottom line: This is my new favorite drink flavoring.

 Healthy and Great Tasting Product,5,"I have been using nutritional yeast for years, almost every single day, and it not only tastes great but is incredibly nutritious. Our three year old son loves it, and especially likes sprinkling it on pasta--I think he feels empowered, and little does he know that he's literally sprinkling nutrition on his food. You can sprinkle this on popcorn or other snack foods to impart a cheesy taste, add a tablespoon to smoothies, pasta sauce, bread, or just about any other savory food. If you're looking for a cookbook with recipes that use this, try New Farm Vegetarian Cookbook . It's a little hipped out, but there's a recipe for nutritional yeast cheese that's pretty amazing. There's also Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook: Delicious Dairy-Free Cheeses and Classic ""Uncheese"" Dishes , but I would try the Farm cookbook first. Lastly, these are large flakes, but Frontier Coop online offers 1 pound bags of Nutritional Yeast ""mini flakes"" which have a finer consistency and sprinkle well from a container with tiny holes (like the kind used to sprinkle powdered sugar).

 Best supplement if you must use formula,5,"Breast milk has a plethora of advantages over formula. Until recently, one of these advantages was that it contained DHA and ARA, fatty acids that are important components of brain structure. Recently, manufacturers have begun adding DHA and ARA to their infant formula. Some studies have indicated that addition of DHA and ARA to formula provides an advantage of 6-7 IQ points over normal formula, nearly as much as the IQ point advantage of breast fed babies. However, the DHA and ARA added to infant formulas are chemically extracted from certain species of algae and mold using solvents, and are not identical to the DHA and ARA found in breast milk. There have also been reports that the DHA and ARA supplemented formula causes diarrhea in some children. In our daughter, it seemed to cause softer and messier stool, though it wasn't quite diarrhea. Baby's only DHA and ARA is extracted from egg yolks using a water based process, and thus may avoid some small risk associated with the solvent extracted versions. It's mixed into formula that isn't fortified with DHA and ARA or into other foods. We use it with Baby's Only toddler formula, and it does not cause messy stool with our daughter. Breast feeding is still better than any formula, of course - it has other advantages, such as a protective effect against infections that the formula makers haven't figured out yet. However, if you must formula feed for some reason - for us, my wife's pumping at work didn't keep up with the baby's demand, and eventually we also had to stop breast feeding to try to start a second baby - mixing Baby's Only DHA and ARA supplement into a nonsupplemented formula is probably the next best thing. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Exactly what I wanted.,5,"I have wanted a Keurig for quite some time now for home use, but wasn't really sure which model I wanted. After plenty of research, I settled on the Office Pro. The major complaint I read about this model was that it wasn't exactly quiet. Those reviews are correct, to an extent. I don't think it's so loud as to be any more distracting than any other noise in the home. It's certainly a lot quieter than my vacuum and my washer. I can't hear it in the next room, and neighbors haven't complained about the noise in the surrounding apartments. I have read review after review of the home brewers with the quiet technology, and I noticed that the one common complaint with those was that the pump failed after a couple months. I'd rather deal with a bit of noise than with a dead coffee maker. We are avid coffee drinkers, and we always use travel mugs in the morning. There isn't a setting for a 16 ounce cup, but we get around that by brewing two 6 ounce cups with a singular k-cup. It give us the perfect amount and intensity of coffee, and leaves enough room for cream and sugar. I love that everyone can have exactly whatever kind or flavor of coffee that they want. No more having to drink chocolate peppermint coffee in the morning because I wasn't the first one up and I don't want to waste a whole pot. I also love that it's always a fresh cup of coffee. No more burnt, old coffee. Just a nice fresh cup. I find that there is a nice variety of K-cups as well, and if you shop around you can usually get them at a great price. My local Bed, Bath and Beyond carries them and you can use a 20% off coupon on them. Impact Office Pro also carries them online, for even cheaper than Keurig's site with their coffee club discount. Speaking of prices, I got my Office Pro for a lot cheaper. Staples has them for $129.99 and you can use a coupon. My account rep at Impact Office Pro went a little lower than the Staples price, and then even took my $25 Staples coupon, bringing the price down even more. So shop around and see where you can get the best deal! A word of warning, the my k cup reusable filter offered by Keurig does not work with this model. However, the solofill refillable k-cup does work so if you want to use your own coffee, buy the solofill k cup. All in all, I highly recommend this brewer. It's a great addition to our home. …",43 out of 43 users found this review helpful

 My Favorite by a Landslide so Far,5,"I must admit that I have gone a little overboard with my k-cup sampling. So far I must have tried about 50 different blends. OVerall I must say that the vast majority of them have been pleasant, better than what I used to make in my coffee brewer. Then I tried the Donut Shop brand. When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee. Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about. When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing. Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe. My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day. Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one. It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite. I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it.

 Converted me to tea over coffee - it's that good,5,"Before buying my Keurig brewer, I never really like black tea. I would drink herbal tea from tme to time but black tea always seemed too bitter. After trying Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast Tea, I was instantly converted. There is no bitter taste and it's so much less acidic than coffee and therefore much easier on my stomach. It has a mild, slightly fruity taste that is perfect with breakfast or really anytime of day. I've tried it plain and with a bit of milk and sugar as well. I honestly have become more of a tea drinker than coffee drinker since trying this delicious tea. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Something has changed. Quality control must have slipped as far as being organic goes.,2,"We have been using Newman's organic dry dog food for over 5 years...it was a Godsend when we discovered it. Our little Jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching...after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief. Then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities...so we decided to go organic...all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the Newman's. However after giving glowing reviews for many years, we now have to concede something has changed...our little Jack's itching returned to the point of drawing blood. It is clear something changed and I believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was...we are on the hunt again. I am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients...but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive...this likely is not for you. Too bad...it once was a superior product. …",38 out of 43 users found this review helpful

 Contains BPA!,1,"I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! It makes me sick that I fed them with BPA laden baby bottles before I knew better. We already have enough cancer in our family. I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder. I wrote to Muir Glen (now owned by General Mills) to see if they have any plans to remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. I would be happy to pay a bit more for jarred tomato products if they can't come up with BPA free cans. Or how about tomatoes in cartons or frozen? Please write to the companies that you buy canned tomatoes from and ask for BPA free products. Let me know if anyone finds BPA free tomato products, such as tomato paste, diced tomatoes, whole tomatoes...by responding to this comment--I will get an email.

" Very good product, but a 60% price increase in a week?",5,"I bought a jar of this thing on Aug 16 for seven bucks (and free delivery if over Superstore's minimum for such). It came pretty fast, in a semi-liquid state but not leaking; rather well packaged. I let it melt completely in a warm room (CO melts at about 80 deg F) and then put it in the fridge to let it solidify. One of the reasons I did (and always do) that is to smooth out the texture: as is, every type of CO I've tried comes in like a bunch of white fibers stuck in more even liquid, but if you thaw it completely and then freeze, it becomes all evenly semi-transparent, like one thick candle sort of thing. It probably doesn't matter; just a personal quirk, I guess. Anyway, this is good stuff: the taste is nice -- very good for sweetich things like carrots or plums, for example (I always have a bowl of very lightly steamed carrots around, and I snack on them, taking one and dipping it into CO, which is good for two reasons: first, it tastes great, and second, carotene is fat-soluble so you need to combine carrots with some sort of fat or it won't be used by the body well). All in all, there isn't much to say -- CO is CO is CO; this kind is no different from other types I've tried. CO in general is shamelessly hyped as a sort of panacea from every health problem known to man; this is mostly lies, but two things are true: it is tasty, and it's good for skin/hair (I've tried both, and it's true, it works). Don't believe anything else and don't ""take"" it daily as if it were a medicine: it's pure saturated fat and that's the end of it: it will raise your cholesterol as any other kind of saturated fat. As far as its being a weight-loss agent, this is not a complete lie, but remember, it works only if you _substitute_ CO for other kinds of saturated fats (that means quit eating butter, meat, etc.) If, otoh, you simply _add_ it to your normal diet, you're not gonna lose any weight -- instead, you're gonna gain weight at least as good as you would otherwise + increase your cholesterol. But if you decide to substitute, do not think it's an easy choice: CO is pure saturated fat, whereas other sources of saturated fats (butter, meat, etc.) come with a lot of nutritional goodness like vitamins, proteins, and the like -- things that CO is wholly devoid of. So my suggestion, for what it's worth (not much, I know) is to use CO just as another agreeable food to be used in moderation, not a magic medicine. I read somewhere that a 40-sh male in good health on a 2000 cal/day diet can get 200 calories from saturated fats w/o harming himself. One other thing I wanted to mention: the jar says it's ""pure extra virgin"" -- keep in mind that ""extra virgin"" is meaningful only when applied to olive oil. That is because there are specific and stringent industry standards stipulating what constitutes ""virgin"", ""extra virgin"", etc. There are no such standards about any other oils, so saying your CO is ""extra virgin"" communicates zero useful information and is no more than disingenuous hand-waving. It's like Nutiva says on their jars ""no cholesterol!"". No kidding, it's like wood-free nails. Of course plant-derived foods have no cholesterol, but BS rules in this industry, so just be aware of what's what and smart enough to dismiss useless hype like claims of a CO being ""extra virgin"". OK, there's really no more to say: as long as you use this tasty substance rationally, it's good stuff, so bottomline is: recommended -- except for one thing: just as I was deciding it's time to post a review and navigating to this page, I noticed that the price went up by the mind-blowing 60 percent since, not just since I bought it (two weeks ago), but literally within the last few days. Does my salary go up 60 percent in a couple of days? No. So, while the product is good and I can't give it less than five stars, I will suggest you do not reward naked greed and at least try to find better-priced alternatives. Especially in this economic environment that we have right now. The current price here is even higher than it is in Wegman's (brick-and-mortar grocery store; they carry it, but it's more than the seven bucks I bought it for here). PS. Btw, I see now someone reports that this oil comes in a glass jar: this is a bare-faced lie. The jar is transparent plastic, quite soft actually, so you can't _honestly_ mistake it for glass. Be extremely suspicious about these massive five-star reviews (here and elsewhere); I for a long time have a feeling those are posted by manufacturers' employees to create hype (and why not? Superstore does nothing to guard against fake reviews; all one needs to do in order to start posting reviews (real OR fake) is buy something once from this site). Some reviews read like the reviewer hasn't actually seen the product in question and is interested only in adding another five-star rating, not the review. PPS.

 Awesome horsepills,5,"First off, I think the reviews on this page are confusing. It seems to me there is a mix of people who bought the container of oil and those that bought the pills. I bought the pills and am enjoying them very much. I read news reports on how coconut oil may help with Alzheimers, diabetes and diet so I thought I'd try them since I have issues with all of these in my family line. I feel more mentally focused and alert since I've started taking them a week or so ago. I definitely plan to continue to take the pills. They are large as many people have noted (see my photo uploaded with the quarter), but they are not any bigger than any other large vitamin. The pills, like other vitamins, do have a slight smell if you stick your nose in the bottle. But they have no taste, no after taste and no gross burps later. The bottle calls for 3 pills 3x a day. 9 seems pretty excessive for vitamins. I'm taking 6 right now, 3 with my coffee in the morning and 3 with dinner since I usually only have 1 or 2 meals a day. I would note that taking these has loosened some things up, you know -- down there. It's not an emergency bathroom thing but you probably will be flowing pretty freely when you do go. I'm assuming my body will eventually adjust and become more regular but it's not really bother if it doesn't. …",25 out of 25 users found this review helpful

I also use the Krups espresso machine in order to steam my milk before mixing with the heated up Chai. And as a result, it tastes exactly like Starbucks. I can drink it at a much lower cost though by making it at home! If your Chai is made this way, you shouldn't taste a 'peppery' or 'spicy' taste. That means there is too much chai.

 Absolutely amazing -- thank God for this product!,5,"A little over a week ago and completely out of the blue, I started having heart palpitations. I'm a 27-year-old female and am on no medications and have no significant medical history. The first two days, I only noticed a few of them. Then for the next 3 days, I had them much more frequently. I could put my fingers on my pulse and literally feel my heart skipping beats (a long pause followed by 2 closer-together beats). It was absolutely terrifying; I couldn't sleep for two nights because I was afraid I wouldn't wake up. I had read that these are typically harmless, especially if they aren't accompanied by any underlying heart issues or symptoms. But that doesn't make them any less frightening and unsettling. Finally, on day 5, I went to the doctor who confirmed with an EKG that I was having premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). He told me just to forget about them, that they were harmless. That lessened my anxiety related to the heart palpitations a bit, but I knew something had to have caused them, and I wasn't content to just deal with them forever. I had my blood checked, and I was neither hyperthyroid nor hypothyroid, and my potassium level was normal (these are potential causes of the PVCs according to my doctor, in addition to caffeine and stress). But I also read that a magnesium deficiency can cause heart palpitations (and being deficient wouldn't have been a surprise because my diet had been less-than-ideal). So, on day 6, I went to a health food store and was encouraged to try this product. I paid $18 for 4 ounces! I went home and took a big initial dose (probably 2 teaspoons) and, within a few hours, I noticed that my heart beat wasn't skipping as frequently. The next day, I noticed an occasional flutter but nothing like the big scary pounding flip-flops from the days before. The next day, they were gone altogether, and they have not returned. I have been palpitation-free for several days now, and I undoubtedly owe my relief to this magnificent magnesium! Beyond the cessation of the abnormal heart beat, this product helps me sleep like a log! It has also made me feel much calmer, even in situations where I ordinarily would feel anxious. I am truly thankful to have found this product! …",21 out of 26 users found this review helpful

It strains the milk very well--much better than cheese cloth. However, I would recommend purchasing the 2 quart bag over the 1 quart for the obvious reason of making larger batches when needed for additional use of the milk as an ingredient or for more people. Also, the 2 quart bags are MUCH easier to transfer the milk into from a blender. They are very reusable, and wash in a few seconds. Very easy cleanup.

 Best Matcha in this price range!,4,"This is a good matcha for the price. The best matcha can be much more expensive but well worth it, espcially if you happen to study the Japanese tea ceremony or you are a tea connoseur. If you do get this type of tea, it is wise to buy a proper bamboo wisk and sift it first, otherwise it can get lumpy. Making matcha the traditional way is well worth the effort and there is a LOT to learn about it. Some say to master the tea ceremony can take years. As far as the health benefits go, there is a lot of talk about green tea being good for you and I must say, I feel really good now that I am drinking it 1-3 days per week and I have even lost a few pounds. Matcha does have caffine and if I have more than two or three bowls I will definately feel it. It's probably a wise idea to not drink too much matcha before bed! Green and black tea both have caffine for the most part. Different teas have different amounts of caffine. It's a good idea to read labels carefully and do your research if you are sensitive to caffine or must avoid it. The type of caffine in a beverage also has a lot to do with how people respond to it. Caffine also has a different effect on everyone depending on your body. Some people get jittery, others don't and the more caffine you consume the less you will tend to feel the effects of it. I tend to feel jittery with coffee or soda but not with tea. Matcha is also great for smoothies, baking, ice cream and much, much more. Another note; Fresh matcha is a very bright green color, old matcha gets a darker pine-gray color to it and can taste bitter or ashy with a clumpy consistancy. Always note the date on the can. To avoid stale green tea, I reccommend storing it in an airtight bag and keeping it in the fridge. Stale tea isn't noticable when you put it in a smoothie or cake but if you make a hot beverage you will notice a big difference in the quality. Matcha is generally served with sweets and is good paired with fruity or vanilla desserts but it tends to clash with chocolate. Of course mochi (sweet rice cakes) go very well with matcha and are the traditional choice but unless you live near an Asian market, or you're a good cook, they can be hard to come by and have a short shelf life. The frozen Mochi ice cream nuggets are a good option too and sold in a lot of grocery stores. I reccommend this tea if you are new to drinking matcha. If you love it, it's the tastiest matcha in it's price range and if you hate it, at least you didn't waste too much cash. If you are taking tea lessons it's a good 'practice' tea and won't break your pocketbook, especially when you find out the price of tea bowls, fukusa, natsume, furo and the other utensils used in a tea ceremony! Regardless if you study Chado or if you are a casual tea drinker, I encourage all tea lovers to try matcha. The methods of making and preparing matcha are over 800 years old and when you taste it, you certainly understand why it's never gone out of style! …",41 out of 43 users found this review helpful

 Tastes Great!,5,"Ok, i'm not really sure about that one. In January I adopted my very first cat. I haven't had one since I was 10! This is mainly due to living in apartments and allergies. My cat is a 2 1/2 year old Maine ****. It's REALLY fat and weighs about 14lbs. He has a belly that hangs down to the floor almost. After hearing about all those bad pet foods a few years back, I did some research into what pet foods were the best. Decided to try this. I'll admit that it's NOT cheap at all, but it doesn't bother me. Why? It costs me the Superstore price, but one bag can last me months! I did some research into weight loss for cats and tried to feed him the correct amount, but unfortunately after nearly a year, he hasn't lost any weight on this food. I think he just doesn't get enough exercise. He does have a ton of energy and is always running around it seems, but he still likes to sleep a LOT. Due to this food (i'd imagine) his fur is shiny and soft. Other than the weight problem he seems like a healthy cat. Sadly, I had to switch pet foods. This might sound really silly and gross to admit, but this food makes his poo extremely stinky! It stinks up the entire house when he ""goes"". No cat litter on earth will stop it. I've tried different litters and boxes, not even thinking it was the food. It most definitely was. I clear the litter box every single day, but being ""bombed out"" is not fun. Somedays it really made me ALMOST not want a cat! I switched to Wellness Healthy Weight Cat Food (which seems even more expensive) and the problem went away. I also did a taste test on my cat. I sat out a bowl of EVO and Wellness Cat foods and he preferred the wellness brand. He actually told me this. Seriously though, he would eat the Wellness, take a few bites of the EVO and then leave it alone. This doesn't really mean anything. The best tasting cat food is not always the best for a cat. The EVO food is probably of a higher quality, but i'm not sure. I'd imagine either brand is good. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Organic doesn't always mean quality.,1,"There are 4 primary sources for cinnamon used in cooking.

Simply organic uses the latter of the four because it is cheap do to having an extremely low oil content. Basically it is junk. If your cinnamon is bitter and not sweet (and this is) it is toxic. So just because it is ""organic"" does not mean it is good for you. I bought some hoping that it was right because none label their sources and am severely disappointed.

My dog is 10 lbs and 11-months old. I wouldn't recommend this product if you have a dog that's more than 30 pounds. I would say a miniature spaniel or small cockerspaniel would be the top sized dog you'd want to use a litter box with. But then again, if you have a large space like a connecting garage or a very large kitchen area and have space for an extra large tray, it could probably work too. Although I don't use my litter box outdoors, I can see this as a useful potty aid if you don't want your dog to mess up your outside garden area. I'm thinking about adding a box outside because I don't have a lawn, and it's mostly concrete and dirt. My dog still enjoys his walks, and DOES go poop and pee outside in the park lawn whenever I take him. He also goes inside his litter box, but it's not as preferable for him. He will still pee on my carpet when he's roaming around and not near the litter box. So my dog, even at 11 months old is not completely housebroken. He's not a very smart dog, so I don't think he ever will be housebroken. If you have a dog like mine, this might be your best solution. If I know that he has just eaten or drank a lot of water, I bring him back to the litter box after a couple of hours (which is in my laundry room) and close the door for a while or wait until he goes. This is the only way to make sure he doesn't have accidents. If your dog is paper trained or pad trained, you should follow the ""transition"" instructions on the Purina website. My dog has only used the litter box since birth, but when he discovered the lawn, he never quite liked the litter box as much. So here is the best way to use this litter. 1. Only line the bottom of the tray with a small layer, just enough to cover the bottom. This will save you A LOT of litter and cash in your pocket. The instructions wants you to put in at least an inch of pellets. I found it very wasteful and heavy to pick up and clean as well. 2. The second most important reason why you want just a THIN layer is because it's always best to replace your litter often. This makes for less waste. 3. When your dog pees on the pellets, they swell up and you can tell which pellets have been soaked. If you're careful, you can use a small scooper to clean that portion out and replace it with fresh pellets. 4. Also clean up poop out of the litter box on a daily basis or as soon as your dog poops. This will prevent a smelly room, and encourage your dog to go back in the litter box. My dog barks when there's poop in the box and tells me to clean it when he's in his room at night. (He literally drags me out of bed with his barking!) I just use some toilet paper to pick it up, and flush the poop down the toilet. This saves on biodegradable poop bags and again, puts a little cash back in your pocket. 5. If you bought the Petco Blue litter box tray, there's some tricky placement to consider due to the foot ledge that sticks out. Do read my review on the Petco blue litter box tray or remember these tips: a. NEVER put the box flush against the wall. This won't allow your dog ample space to roam around the litter box before it actually pees or poops. This will limit the number of accidents outside of the box. Also, if you have a male dog with a marking problem, you will see lots of urine on the floor next to the wall. b. Face the foot ledge toward the wall, (if your room is narrow and long like a laundry room...this is where we put our tray) and leave some space between the foot ledge and the wall for your dog to walk around. c. Be prepared to sop up pee on the foot ledge. This will be a common place for your dog to have a pee or poop accident. Still...better on the ledge than on the floor. The blue raised circles on the foot ledge makes it difficult to clean urine. I have to fold up my paper towels and sop around the circles. d. Always use a doggie cleaner on the foot ledge after you clean up an accident on the foot ledge. Your room will start to smell if you don't. e. If you don't want to struggle with this seemingly difficult foot ledge, try the actual PURINA tray. I think the trick is to have a high edge around the tray, so the dog is not tempted to be partially outside the tray when it is going pee or poop. f. Wash your tray every week or at least every two weeks. No matter how often you empty your pellets, the smell still gets on the tray itself. There just isn't a perfect sanitary system. I guess not having a dog is the perfect sanitary system! :-) 6. Pellet bags are heavy...especially the 25 pound bag. I bought a plastic bowl to help me scoop the pellets out and control the amount that goes in the tray. No one wants to scoop the pellets BACK into the bag from a dirty tray after the fact. Get the scooper...it will actually save you money by controlling the amount of pellets that go into the tray, AND your back in the long run. 7. To avoid your dog from chewing on the pellets, especially in the wee morning hours when it starts to get hungry, leave some treats around his room a night. Be prepared to sweep up pellets on occasion. A bored and hungry dog, makes for a naughty dog. 8. If you are transitioning your dog, make sure you put some of his urine soaked pads or newspapers inside the box so he can smell it in the early stages. Your dog should adjust in about a week or two. Good Luck! …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 To Life !!!,4,"Sun Maid pitted plums (or, prunes) are the best brand of pitted and dried plums on your grocer's shelf--period. These dried pitted plums are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too. However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They contain sugar (12 grams per serving) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that. In addition, a few of these helps fight constipation really well! Don't eat too many--you'll have stomach trouble--trust me! However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these pitted plums are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, Superstore correctly notes that they do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily. In my personal opinion, I love to refrigerate these and eat them cold. They are remarkably sweet, too. Note: There should be an expiration date printed on the container. Eat or use these before the expiration date so you get them while they're nice and fresh! These pitted plums are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. Pitted Plums provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus. Highly recommended--to life! …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" Don't bother with this, just use corn starch",1,"I've been making jam for years using low-sugar Sure-Jell (you can get away with using even less sugar than listed on the package if you're generous with the lemon juice). My jam always comes out beautifully. Unfortunately, I ran out of Sure-Jell tonight, and used a packet of Pomona's Universal Pectin that was sitting in my cupboard instead. BIG mistake. The jam jelled, all right, but the final consistency was pasty and the brightness of the fruit flavors was totally clouded. I got pretty much the same results as if I'd thickened my fruit with corn starch. Ick! Next time I'll stick with Sure-Jell. …",5 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 They call it nature's sports drink,4,"I have seen delivery truck for this drink driving around town. On the side they had ""Natures Sport's Drink"". I never thought of Coconut Water as a sports drink but I thought I would give it a try. The package the drink comes in is ""Tetra Pak""; which is a fancy way of saying juice box. Because this seems very similar to the way I used to drink my Hi-C Juice when I was in grade school. No straw here though, just a foil covered hole in which you peel off the foil to drink. Ingredients are as follows: Natural coconut water, pink guava puree, cane juice, vitamin c, and natural fruit flavor. Not too bad, sounds good, you have to add vitamin c to give the drink a little zing otherwise it comes off too bland, and they at least admit to adding ""natural fruit flavor"" which if you read the FDA website doesn't really have to be that natural at all. But all-in-all the ingredients list looks good. One container is 8.5 ounces, one serving, and you have 78 calories, no fat, 128mg of sodium, 302mg potassium, 18.8g of carbs, with .5g of that being fiber and 16.6g being sugar. You also get 0.8g of protein and the added vitamin c gives 183% of your daily value. Let's move on to taste: Serve cold, shake well, and open...tastes like coconut and guava. I guess I should have expected that. It feels fairly light on the tongue, not that oily mouth coating feel you get from regular coconut water. O.N.E. claims they get the water form green coconuts before the meat forms, so that accounts for the lack of oils and fats. So you get nice tropical flavor. Like a really watered down pina colada. Sadly I am unable to perform blood work and tell you if my electrolytes are being replenished but I am enjoying the flavor. So if coconut and guava appeal to you, and you would like those flavors in a natural sports drink, this may be the drink for you. …",29 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 This product may contain silicon dioxide,1,"The label of this Taco Seasoning informs that this product may contain silicon dioxide. According to Wikipedia the chemical compound silicon dioxide, also known as silica (from the Latin silex), is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula SiO2. It has been known for its hardness since antiquity. Silica is most commonly found in nature as sand or quartz, as well as in the cell walls of diatoms. Inhaling finely divided crystalline silica dust in very small quantities (OSHA allows 0.1 mg/m3) over time can lead to silicosis, bronchitis, or cancer, as the dust becomes lodged in the lungs and continuously irritates them, reducing lung capacities.

 Best Tasting and Healthiest Ready to Drink Meal Replacement Shake,5,"I've been searching since the days that Kashi stopped producing their meal replacement shake mix for something that tastes just as good and is just as good for you. I've tried both available flavors of Orgain and I find the chocolate to have no remnant of soy protein in its taste. The shake tastes great at room temp and amazing chilled. I appreciate that there's some remnants of veggies and fruit in the shake too. Potential downsides: It's not all oil, sugar, and protein....although its mostly that... So it's not exactly as good as sitting down and eating a sandwich. The shake is only made in pre-measured little boxes so there's no opportunity to save some money with a tub of a dry mix. The shakes are expensive too. The trade off is better ingredients, instead of unpronounceable and artificial junk found in say, Slimfast (although that too is mostly oil, sugar, and protein...just from worse ingredient sources). The shake is also not vegan if that's something you're looking for. There's currently only 2 flavors of the shake too, so if variety's your thing, this isn't a good shake to try out long term. I still rate this 5 stars for the ingredients, the taste, and the fairly extensive nutrition content. I wish this had more veggies and fruit in it though...vs. 50 mg each of a fruit and veggie blend. …",40 out of 43 users found this review helpful

 Absolutely loaded with trans-fat,1,"As of Nov 2007, each 16 gram serving contains 2 grams of trans fat! That is 1/8th trans-fat by weight, and more than 1/8 by calories!!! (Please consult the packaging for more current information, many manufacturors are removing trans-fat. Beware: they may legally claim 0 grams of trans fat when they have half a gram PER SERVING, which is very significant for small serving sizes. So you should look for the words ""partially hydroginated"" in the ingredient list. If you see ""partially hydrogenated"" then you know the product has artificial trans fat and you should NOT buy it.) Don't take my word for it that this is bad, because here are some quotations from the survey article Mozaffarian et al ""Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,"" The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354, pages 1601-1613 (2006). Here are a few quotations from this article: ""given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD [""coronary heart disease""] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. ""heart attacks""] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted."" Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet: ""The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed."" They conclude ""On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm."" Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook ""nutritional epidemiology"", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book ""Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."" …",8 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Veterinary approved...,5,"As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets. I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling. Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those ""duh"" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent. Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least. My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of ""treat."" It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it ""makes pills a treat to give!"" The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger ""capsule"" dog Pill Pockets. The cons: One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!

My highest compliment is that these Wissotzky teas taste real, unlike many other flavored teas that often don't taste as you'd expect. When you brew a cup of lemon tea - guess what... you get delicious lemon-tasting tea. The box is nice. Nothing special, but a nice clean look and I really like the inside lid's labeling that gives a little information on each tea flavor in case you're not sure what flavor you want any given day. Oh yeah, the other great thing about this sampler are there aren't any ""filler"" flavors.

 Peanut Butter Flavor without the Peanut Butter Guilt,5,"I love high-octane peanut butter, but not the fat/calorie content. TASTE: If you are accustomed to low-salt or raw products, the taste will be fine. If someone in the house balks at the taste, you can toss in a dash of fine sea salt or honey (agave works well too). You could easily mix PB2 with PB to wean onto this gradually. TEXTURE: Mixes fast and is very smooth (surprisingly). From the jar, it's similar in consistency to powdered sugar. Open factory seal on jar carefully so it doesn't fly out (trust me). MIXING: Easily mixes using a small spoon or spatula in a gently sloping small bowl (I use a pinch bowl) USAGE: PB2 has recipes on their website (Bell Plantation) and they also sell a chocolate/pb product. I'm a fan of straight PB2 (a spoon by itself) but have had PB2 on crackers, sprinkled on banana/apple slices, and am looking forward to making homemade PB2 ice cream this summer. STORAGE: I was a bit disappointed at shelf life projection. As a dry product, it should last for years but the company says 10-12 months unopened and 4-6 opened. I would prefer to buy the larger sizes or a case to save more. COST: It can be obtained cheaper elsewhere (like on the PB2 website) but I had free shipping purchases to offset the cost. I wanted to try just one jar before committing to a larger sized container from the company. If you purchase natural products, the price won't be such a shock. BIGGEST PROS: lower calorie and fat content - hands down the best. Dogs like it too ;) BIGGEST CONS: high cost and not a product you can 'make ahead' very successfully (though this could be considered a ""PRO"" because it helps with portion control. I make it as needed. This product will not change your life, but it will satisfy your peanut butter cravings. …",24 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 A great variety of sea salt!,5,"This was my first sampling of the varieties of sea salt out there.

Probably less than half as much to give your food the same amount of saltiness that you're used to. Alderwood Smoked Salt -- like regular salt, but with a smoky barbecue-ey flavor. Even food cooked indoors tastes like you grilled it over an alderwood fire. Alaea Hawaiian Salt -- the most mild of the three, with a slight ""ocean-ey"" flavor and aroma.
