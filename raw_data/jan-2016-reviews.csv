 The herbs were great...but the cherry tomatoes...not so great,2,"The herb kit that came with my Aerogarden was superb and I enjoyed caring for my little garden. Once it was time to replace it, I purchased the cherry tomato seed kit. These also grew rapidly, but one day I noticed that they had completely fallen over...how would I stake these on an Aerogarden? And yes, the lights were as close to the plants as possible. I kind of leaned them against each other to keep them upright. But they still fell over several times. So they grew and grew but I never got any tomatoes. :( I also did follow the directions to ensure that they had complete darkness for proper flowering. Fortunately we have several tomato and cherry tomato plants in our outdoor vegetable garden. Unfortunately, I spent $20 on 3 cherry tomato Aerogarden plants and got zero yield. …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Even more useful than regular parchment paper,5,"I originally bought this just because it was cheaper than the regular parchment paper in the grocery store. I was therefore very pleasantly surprised to find out that it's actually much more useful than regular parchment paper. The silicone non-stick coating is no joke. Before I got this, I would often line pans with aluminum foil and spray them with oil to roast peppers, cook frozen samosas, etc. Now, I instead just lay the food on top of a piece of parchment paper, and the non-stick coating makes oil unnecessary. And, this paper is *much* cheaper than aluminum foil. Two things to note: at 13"" wide, it's a couple of inches narrower than most regular parchment paper. Also, unlike most grocery store brands, it doesn't have a metal band to help you tear off sheets. (They claim that you can use the cardboard edge to do that, but it doesn't work.) But 13"" is plenty for almost everything I do. And using scissors to cut the paper is a small price to pay given how well this paper works. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Not what the picture describes,2,"I bought this steak for my father in law for Christmas because he had always wanted to try Omaha Steaks, and I heard good things about it. I purchased the private reserve because it is a higher quality of meat than the regular cuts and wanted to get him something extra special, but was I in for a surprise. I should have stuck with the cheaper meat. The meat came with extremely large amounts of fat all around. We had cut off a significant amount of fat prior to cooking,and the steak was still fatty once it was cooked. I was very dissapointed and so was he. We were going to call Omaha Steaks to complain, will never buy this brand again. Very unhappy with it. The taste wasn't even something that was worth raving about either. I could have went to the supermarket and bought a prime rib on sale that tasted better than this was, which i have in the past, and didn't spend nearly as much as they charged. …",7 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 What a ripe off - GIVE ME A BREAK,2,Sorry but I had these noodles and they are no better then the 10 - 20 cent version. THE ONLY difference is the spices - oh wait I can buy the same spice for one dollar a jar from McCormic. Anyway the food is fine - but at over one dollar a pouch - it is FAR from worth it.

 Where's The Cardamon?  Prepare for the Cloveaload!,1,"If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you. If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is ""this is NOT chai tea."" There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea. As it is, it should be called ""spicy clove tea."" This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices. It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves. I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region. Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors. Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision. I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically. I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a ""traditional"" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand. For all the people out there who know what Indo-Pakistani Chai tastes like, I'll be reviewing each of the ""chai"" K-Cups according to how they resemble the original. …",21 out of 29 users found this review helpful
 Wow!  We're cookin' bacon now!,5,"I've been a microwave oven user since 1986, and I've tried all sorts of tricks for cooking meat in them. For the most part, I have it all down pat - but cooking bacon without mess or fuss or stuck-to-the-paper-towel bacon has eluded me. Not any more! I got a Bacon Genie about a month ago and since then I've found that I can cook both regular and turkey bacon to exactly the desired doneness and crispyness I want. For my health I tend more towards turkey bacon than regular bacon and I've found that the Bacon Genie makes it easy to cook eight slices in just four-and-a-half (chewy) to five (crispy) minutes - just right for two people for breakfast. (I place three strips on each outer side and two on the middle bar.) And cleanup? Not a problem. The bacon's fat drips straight down to the collector in the bottom with no splatter. Once I'm done, I pour the drippings straight into my grease jar (What? You don't have a grease jar? For shame! You can always re-use for other cooking or throw the full jar away, saving you sink from grease clogs.) for disposal. Also, the Bacon Genie comes with a nice pair of tongs for removing the bacon without getting your fingers burned or greasy. Yes. I cannot recommend the Bacon Genie strongly enough! …",8 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Makes GREAT Healthy cherry pie filling,5,"This is a great product. It's not as finicky as arrowroot powder which if heated too long will not thicken. I made the recipe on the back with some additional changes and it was fabulous!! My kids loved it and it's a great substitute for the very unhealthy cans of cherry pie filling on the store shelfs.

 Could be OK if not for the artificial sweetener and flavors,2,"The product's name lead me to believe it would be naturally flavored with flavors I like. Unfortunately, the flavor of the artificial sweetener is very pronounced and it is a flavor I strongly dislike. I do not use artificial sweeteners and avoid artificially sweetened beverages because I do not like the flavor, not for health reasons. I used one packet per 24 oz bottle of water and I am sure that if I were to mix it per instructions it would be way too sweet. I was not able to taste honey or pomegranate. Blackberry is somewhat pronounced, although not as a natural but as an artificial blackberry flavor. I also had a problem with packaging. When I tore the corner of a packet at notch, the resulting hole was too small for the contents to pour out. I had to jiggle the packet and push the contents out. That created a cloud of fine dust which I inhaled - not pleasant. I struggled with the second packet as well. It is possible that it is just the batch I received that did not have the tear notch punched properly. The description says ""Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors."" I am surprised this kind of marketing is allowed or tolerated. It is just as much (probably more if you consider contribution to the total sweetness) sweetened with artificial sweeteners as it is with honey. As for the green tea or pomegranate flavor... Who can tell that this tastes anything like either one of those things? It seems like a manufacturer can show to a cousin of a random employee a picture of tea leaves and pomegranates and let them listen to bees buzzing and then claim that the product was made with tea leaves, honey, and real pomegranate flavor. I would not buy this product the way it currently is. …",17 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Looks like 70% of Cherry Tomato Reviews are NEGATIVE,1,"I am working on my second Cherry Tomato seed kit. After about three months, the first crop provided about eight Cherry tomatoes. Hardly a bumper crop. During the growth I had to clean out the pump which got clogged with roots (more on that latter). So I figured, ok, I had to disturb the root system when I had to clean out the pump, so perhaps that was the problem. I started a second crop of Cherry Tomatoes about three months ago. So far, I have had one marble sized yellow tomato. I also have an additional two, marble sized, yellow tomatoes ripening. I have not even seen any flowers on the two red tomato plants. The red tomato plants grow, but no tomato production. I am running out of plant nutrients. I checked AeroGrows site, and they want a ridiculous price for an additional package of plant nutrients. Corporate greed at its worse. I have read all of the reviews, and I see that about one-third of the Cherry tomato reviews are positive. That leaves two-thirds of Cherry Tomato reviews as negative. Adding my negative Cherry Tomato review drops the positive Cherry tomato reviews to 30% positive, 70% negative. Given that we are all growing these things under pretty well controlled conditions, I suggest that the Cherry tomato seed kits might have a limited shelf life, and AeroGrow could be selling their old kits. My negative review of AeroGrow's cherry Tomato seed kit on their site was NOT PUBLISHED. So I published my review on Superstore. With respect to the AeroGrow garden, in my opinion, the location of the pump is flawed. It should not be located at the bottom of the tank because that is where the roots want to go. The pump should be located higher up on the tank, and it should be located in a position where it can be easily maintained, without damaging your crops. I hope someone else comes out with a competitive product. Frankly, I don't like the way AeroGrow does business. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 CANIDAE - a best choice for Fido or FiFi,5,"I searched for a food that wasn't full of preservatives and fillers, and didn't cost $5 a pound. I did alot of research and read alot of labels. I have a Siberian Husky pup, and Canidae has really proven itself to me. As a former conissour of cheap discount store dog foods, I have finally realized the advantages of feeding a natural premium food. My dogs poop doesnt really stink! True! Poop is still poop, but the smell is minimal. I have noticed it also quickly disinigrates into the ground when it rains. With the cheap food, it smelled like rank dog poop! Would make you retch and gag! And there was so much of it! Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day. AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog!

" I wouldn't cook with it, but it may have medicinal applications",3,"I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that. I tried it in split pea soup that has a pretty strong aroma of its own, and found it quite unworkable. Also, coconut ""oil"" is one of the most saturated fats in nature, so I'd rather just use butter for most things since it is not nearly as saturated. Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it. You cannot ""eat it out of the jar"" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard. It may possibly work for psoriasis or as a hand cream, but remember that your body will smell strongly like coconut if you use it as a salve. I'm pretty skeptical right now, but I have two jars so I am trying some non-culinary things to use it up. …",3 out of 20 users found this review helpful

With a discount and a coupon, I can get about the same price as here on Superstore. But I don't always have a coupon and they're not always discounted...

" mild coffee, easy on your stomach",4,"After drinking 1 cup of coffee daily for 30+ yrs, suddenly it seemed to eat my stomach up, even with the large amount of cream I add to it. I discovered breakfast blend by researching the available k-cups at the Keuring website where they give complete descriptions of each blend. Breakfast blend does not bother my stomach. I can't rave about the coffee and say it's the best cup I have ever tasted but it serves it's pupose. I believe Superstore has the lowest price you will ever find. The best deal for any K-cup is the box of 50. If you subscribe to it, you can choose to recieve it automatically at one or serveral months intervals and save 15%. You can cancel the subscription any time. It comes in a nice sturdy reuseable box too! I also buy Green Mountain's Half-caff coffee, also sold at Superstore. If you have a sensitive stomach or are sensitive to caffeine, this may also be a good choice for you. ps....Everyone loves our Keurig. Most people have to buy one after experiencing ours.

 miracle honey,5,This honey was suggested for my young son's warts. He had eczema as a baby and rapidly spreading warts is a common link to people with eczema. At our last count he had over 25 warts on his two hands. We tried everything to get rid of them from over-the-counter products to several doctor visits to 'freeze' the warts. Nothing was successful. Finally a plastic surgeon recommended this honey because of its success in patients with eczema and psoriasis. Within a week of using the honey the warts were visibly much smaller.

" Outstanding, Bold, Lively Sumatran. best of the K-cups",5,"First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine. Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being ""tangy"" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich. IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4. I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc. Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star. Stale and bitter. I will definitely stay with Puck's. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Nice taste,4,"Blends well in smoothies. Taste is, to me, neutral which is a plus for whey. Difficult to find plain whey from ""Sports"" sources and when I have the taste is not pleasant. The others do contain whey isolate which is supposed to be superior so perhaps that is the difference. Elderly relative was drinking bottled nutritional mixes (Ensure etc) when she felt bad or had trouble keeping food down. They helped but smoothies are better. Make them with whey, egg whites (Deb-El Just Whites here on Superstore sells whites in smaller packages), natural chocolate (Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Cacao Powder), bananas and other fruit. She loves them. The whey and eggs whites give her all the protein she needs in a day in one drink (the egg whites lighten up the drink too but aren't really necessary unless you really want a protein boost).

 Great little funnel pitcher!,4,"I teach German and make funnel cakes with all my 6th grade students (about 175 each year.) I used to do it the ""old fashioned"" way by covering the spout of a funnel with a finger and then pouring it. This was a MESS! This pitcher makes it so much quicker, cleaner and easier! I don't use the ring because it is pretty unnecessary in my opinion (plus it scratches non-stick Teflon off of pan.) I also haven't yet used the mix because we make our own from scratch. So I guess I'm just reviewing the pitcher, but it works GREAT! Because the kids have more control over movement, they really can get creative with their cakes. The one con is that it is made of plastic, so I'm worried that one day I'll have a meltdown with either the bottom being set too close to the burner or the funnel tip going in the hot oil, but so far, so good. This is great fun for everyone and my students LOVE it! A few tips: Add some cinnamon and almond extract--yum! Flip using metal tongs--not a spatula--for less splatter and mess.

" So far, I am disappointed",2,"I have tried 3 recipes, so far, & cannot say I am thrilled. The first was a quick bread that didn't rise & did scorch (not sure why.) When I cut off the scorched bits, I didn't much care for the flavor of the bread. Then I tried coconut muffins with chocolate chips & dried cherries. The recipes in the book I got rely HEAVILY on eggs, & the muffins proved to be rather heavy, with a pronounced eggy flavor. My third attempt was peanut butter cookies. Normal peanut butter cookies tend to disappear rather quickly around here, but these are loitering in the cookie jar. This may be an acceptable substitute for folks with wheat allergies (if the are not also allergic to eggs!), but so far, my family is unenthused.

 Don't Waste Your Money,1,"These ""natural truffles"" are a real travesty of chocolate. Absolutely disgusting. Want to know why the package doesn't display the word ""chocolate"" anywhere? Because they're not legally allowed to. These ""truffles"" do not fit the Food and Drug Administration's legal definition of chocolate. I'm not joking. These things are composed entirely of palm oil with a light dusting of cocoa powder. Cocoa powder, aka ""cocoa solids"", do not contain cocoa butter as does chocolate liquor, and do not satisfy the definition of chocolate. These are a substandard imitation of true chocolate, which is readily apparent in their similarity in consistency to Crisco. The reason they are made with palm oil is because it is significantly cheaper than cocoa butter. It's a cheapness you can taste, definitely. Believe me, I am no connoisseur of chocolate, and no purist by any means. They're just plain bad. Hell, a Hershey's bar is less fake than these. …",18 out of 21 users found this review helpful
" Holy SALT, Batman!",2,"We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a ""healthier"" alternative to regular chips. I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip. The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor. The big issue with these is the sodium level. After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt. A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like. I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%. Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a ""healthy"" alternative to chips. …",45 out of 52 users found this review helpful

 Made in China,1,"I didn't realize when I bought these that they were made in China. In fact, I fed them to my dogs until someone looking at the package pointed it out to me. I'm a little leery of buying dogs treats from China and other developing countries since the melamime incident. Who knows what oversight there is on the production.

I have been giving these to her for about a year or two now.

 Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on,5,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups. I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive. I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products. If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :) EcoBrew VS Solofill First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew. Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker. These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable! I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product. The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly. …",559 out of 562 users found this review helpful

Before going to a doctor for meds, decided to do some resesarch on natural blood pressure and magnesium came up as a suggestion. I settled on this on on a friend's advice. Take it 2x/day.

 Very Good Source of Magnesium,4,"If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too. I have only two problems with the product. First, this particular flavor of Natural Calm neither tastes nor smells all that great: it's sickly sweet. However, there is a non-flavored variety which is great ( Vitality - Natural Calm, oz, 16 powder ). Also, it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage. I've subtracted one star from my rating for those. But, still, I rate this at a Very Good four stars out of five. …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful
" Great coffee, company, and price",5,"I've been drinking this brand of coffee for many years. I was delighted to see them come out in a Keurig compatible form. Because they're not really ""K-Cups"" they don't have to pay the licensing fee, so they can sell for a lower price. The One Cup pods deliver the exact same taste as the beans, a good rich French Roast. Because these are pods and not sealed cups, they should be stored in an airtight container or they will go stale very rapidly. The box is subdivided into smaller sealed bags, each bag holds a few days worth of cups for the two of us at my house. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Insanely powerful,5,"I bought this oil after reading all of the reviews that mentioned just how strong it is. However, it can't be understated just how powerful it is. I have been using it for making cinnamon hard candy. I put a half teaspoon of the cinnamon oil in a blue, Kitchenaid measuring spoon and set it aside for a few moments. When I picked up the spoon again, I noticed that the oil was blue colored. Upon further inspection, I discovered that the oil had actually eaten away at the plastic--it was like I had put nail polish remover (acetone) in the spoon. Do not use this product with plastic measuring spoons! If you're planning to make hard candy with this as well, I'd also recommend that you let the sugar mixture cool quite a bit before adding the cinnamon oil. Adding it at the 300 degrees F needed for the hard crack stage just leads to an overpowering cloud of cinnamon in your kitchen and flavorless candy. This product is good stuff; just be very careful when using it. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful

In fact, I haven't drunk root beer in twenty years or more. So when I ordered Zevia's Ginger Root soda and tried my first can, I thought I was going to puke. This stuff tastes exactly like Pepto Bismol. But you have to remember something here, I'm not a fan of root beer, so maybe this is the way it's supposed to taste. I've read raving reviews about this flavor on other sites but it's just not for me. That's why I had to give it one star. My opinion is subjective like any other one, but if you like root beer, I think you won't be too disappointed because my taste buds tell me that they have a good product, but one I can't enjoy.

 The BEST tasting coconut oil hands down!!,5,"I have tried three different brands of coconut oil: Barlean's, Nutiva, and Tropical Traditions. The VIRGIN coconut oil has a nice, light coconut flavor. The EXPELLER pressed coconut oil has no flavor. So, if you a buying virgin coconut oil here's my tip: Barlean's had the best flavor and smell...I wanted to eat it right out of the jar it smelled so good, tasted phenomenal!! Barlean's was the most expensive of the three but for the flavor worth it. Nutiva was a close second in taste & smell and is more economical. Tropical Traditional (which I have always loved their products in the past) did not measure up in flavor. In fact it had a strange, burnt taste and smell...something was off about it. If you want no coconut flavor at all, get the expeller pressed coconut oil. It is less expensive than virgin coconut oil...all three companies use proper, healthy, non-chemical practices to extract the oil, so I would go with the best buy for the expeller cold pressed oil but pay a little more for the flavored version.

 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",19 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Reality Check -- Cost vs. Questionable Benefit,1,"[As evidenced by the 'Not Helpful' votes on this review, folks apparently don't want to hear what I point out below (the idea of popping a candy-like caramel to save your heart is just TOO appealing), but I'm going to keep this review available for the rationalists out there.] I purchased a couple boxes of these and enjoyed them for several months. They are convenient, they taste great, and supposedly they're good for my health -- what's not too like? Eventually, I uncovered three problems: 1) My physician mentioned something I hadn't realized: 75% of the cholesterol in our bodies is synthesized BY our bodies. Only 25% is ingested through food. Then I read a WebMD article (""Cholesterol Control: The Alternatives"") which mentioned that plant sterols/stanols like Benecol only block absorption of about 10% of the cholesterol in the food we eat. So essentially, these Smart Chews are blocking 10% of 25%. I'll do the math for you... we're blocking 2.5% of total cholesterol. Surprisingly, you'll find other reviewers reporting much larger cholesterol drops, but then it turns out they've changed their diet, gone on statins, started exercising, or introduced other confounding factors... These are wildy uncontrolled experiments from which it is impossible to draw cause-effect conclusions. 2) The whole idea behind this product is based on the ""diet-heart hypothesis"" -- which is the scientific name for the idea that eating cholesterol causes heart disease. At this point, nearly every reputable scientist in the field has dismissed this idea. Ancel Keys -- the father of this hypothesis in the 1940s -- said in 1997: ""There's no connection whatsoever between the cholesterol in food and cholesterol in the blood. . .Cholesterol in the diet doesn't matter at all unless you happen to be a chicken or a rabbit."" (A reference to the inability of certain animals to process dietary cholesterol). Most researchers now believe the primary causes of heart disease are inflammation and oxidative stress. So what exactly are we doing here with these Benecol chews? 3) This might be my own weakness, but I found myself sporadically eating things that I would never normally touch. The guys at work are going for fried chicken? Sure I'll join them -- why not! I'll just pop a Benecol and feel better about it. It was a strange ""enabler"" of bad eating behavior. Ultimately, I'm not sure there is much benefit here, but there certainly is cost! If you want to improve your HDL/LDL ratio (without a prescription statin), you would derive much more benefit from a natural statin (e.g. red yeast rice) which will lower your LDL, or Niacin which will boost your HDL. The key here is that both these approaches act on the more important side of the cholesterol equation: the body's production. …",10 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Bold? Not!,1,"I bought Emeril's K-cups based on the reviews here. I love strong, bold coffee but Emeril's goes way over the top. There is a difference between bold and bitter and this coffee is just plain bitter and it is one of the worst coffees I have ever had. I got a Keurig B60 after my coffee maker broke and saw a Keurig in one of the lounges at work. I was taken in by its convenience and bought one and am the sorriest person I ever did. I have sampled all the Keurig K-cups and cannot find one to my liking. They are either too weak and watery no matter what size cup you make or just plain bitter which leaves an aftertaste. In addition,if you like stronger coffee, you need to make the smallest size cup, 5.5 oz. which in this day and age is ridiculous; people drink out of large mugs and you can drink that 5.5 oz in 3 or 4 gulps! I am getting rid of the darn thing and going back to brewing my own. There is a reason that the majority of the nation's premium coffee roasters have NOT jumped on the Keurig bandwagon.

 A big winner - tasty and ultra crunchy,5,"Just tried these for the first time - and they're a very nice snacking cracker. There's nothing I can compare them to because they're just unique. Their texture is very different from a ritz type, or saltine type cracker. These nut-thins have a MAJOR crunch - a snappy crunch - hard crunch - but still not a problem to bite down and chew since they're very thin. If you break one in half, you'll hear a clear snap. The flavor comes through as pleasantly nutty. Not necessarily an over-abundance of almond flavor, because the almond seems subtle to me, but I think the toasty rice must be the nutty flavor I get. There's a hint of a buttery flavor - and just a pleasant bit of saltiness not too much. The ingredients list is fairly simple: Rice Flour, Almonds, Potato Starch, Salt, Expeller Pressed Safflower, Natural Almond Flavor, Butter Flavor (Contains Milk). Health aspects: As a lactose intolerant person, I can tell you the ""contains milk"" has been no issue for me personally in these nut-thins - I am not getting a lactose reaction. I suspect the ""milk"" is mostly butter, and butter is something I never have issues with anyway. I would guess this product has no more lactose than lactose free milk - as the grams of sugar are listed as zero on the package for a serving. (The gov lets them list zero if it is below .5 grams I believe). If you're more severely affected than I am by lactose - you may still want to proceed with caution. As an ibs and acid reflux sufferer - I found this food totally neutral - no reactions - again this is my personal reaction. I'm not a doctor - so take that with a grain of salt. Also - the box notes this is a gluten free food - and the ingredients show no wheat. So far I've been munching them plain - and they're really nice. But I can see where any topping: cheese, cream cheese, ham, etc. would be super on them. I'll buy them again for sure. Enjoy! …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 A fan,5,"Ok, this stuff is the cure for family visits lol. I only had this stuff a week or so before going home to visit my very large and loud family that although I love dearly, can drive me crazy when it's unheard of to stay in a hotel. I drank this in the evenings and it is like it melted everything away including the anxiety of staying with my mother and dealing with her obsession of cleaning with her new mini sweeper, going here and there to see this and that person, having to of course spend extra money that I normally don't, AND having my Weimaraner at my moms hearing her gripe about what his claws will do to her wood floor.

 Most delicious popcorn ever!,5,"I'm a real popcorn nut. I've been trying for years to get that real ""movie theatre"" taste. Well, I've done it, and one better. The theatres use coconut oil blended with butter ""flavoring"". The problem is it's partially hydrogenated, which as most of you know is not healthy. This Nutiva Coconut Oil is pure, and extra virgin. Used by itself in popcorn, the taste is a bit too coconutty for me. The secret? Add about 1/4 real butter to the coconut oil in your popper. Yes, real butter is healthy for you, unlike margarines or so called buttery toppings. So the perfect blend of Nutiva Coconut oil and butter produces the most excellent popcorn you could ever imagine. You feel good after eating it. Also a couple of other tips, all popcorn kernals are not created equal. Use Orville's for a much more tender pop. And get popcorn salt, not regular salt, and not Flavacol. Popcorn salt is super flaky and sticks like magic to the popcorn. Simply add it in the popper while it's popping. Adjust accordingly for your taste. Enjoy! …",16 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 An American Classic - The Diet Version,5,"There are two soft drink giants in North America, and I assume they are the two biggest world-wide, the Coca Cola Company and the Pepsi-Cola Company. The battle between these two giants has many fields, including fountain drinks, schools, and grocery stores. At various times the two players have held varying percentages of the market, with Coke currently being ascendant. We drank Coke in our house from the time I can remember. There were numerous brands of soft drinks and colas to which I have been exposed, but I have always returned to the original, Coca Cola. Coca Cola is more than a soft drink; it is frequently synonymous with America and freedom in many parts of the world. In fact, you can say that Coca Cola has become an American icon, though it is available world wide. Coca Cola memorabilia has become popular as collectibles, with various items dating back to the first half of the last century going for incredible sums of money. At the core of the company name, the memorabilia and the attributes associated with the name is the product itself, the one and only Coca Cola. The product itself started life as a tonic in 1886, growing steadily in popularity and distribution so that it is probably the American brand with the greatest world-wide recognition. The original Coke contained sugar and remains a yummy soft drink. However, for those of us who like the flavor of Coke but do not need the calories, Diet Coke is my preferred alternative. I remember when I first started drinking Diet Coke that I had a little bit of difficulty becoming accustomed to the flavor, but now that I have become accustomed to the flavor of Diet Coke I find the flavor of classic Coke to be a little strange. I drink far more Diet Coke than classic Coke. I think I prefer Diet Coke over Diet Pepsi because Diet Coke has a slightly stronger emphasis on carbonation. The mild burn as the cold carbonation goes down your throat is somehow enervating and refreshing, and reminds me of good times and good things. All my associations with Diet Coke are positive. The 12 can Fridge Pack is a one of the numerous ways in which Diet Coke can be purchased. The biggest advantage to the Fridge Pack is that it is specifically intended to sit on a refrigerator shelf and be a dispensing unit for cans of Diet Coke. The only problem with the Fridge Pack is that you must remove one can of Diet Coke when you open the box, so you either have to sit the single can on the shelf or you have to drink it, if you plan on using the box as a dispenser. I still prefer 12 ounce cans over the various other size configurations because I can usually drink an entire can, thus preserving the carbonation and fresh flavor of the drink. The two liter bottles are fine if you are having a party or drink a lot of Diet Coke, but it seems to me that as the bottle gets near the bottom the Diet Coke seems less fresh if the bottle has been around more than a day or two; the same with the 20 ounce bottles, which I am unable to drink in one sitting. Diet Coke is a personal favorite, even over the original Classic Coke. I occasionally will drink another brand for variety or other reasons, but I always come back to the original. As Coke once advertised, ""Have a Coke and a smile!"" …",2 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Disappointed: Sad or displeased because someone or something has failed to fulfill one's hopes or expectations.,1,"For years, I used the generic store brand canned tomatoes. And for years, I thought if you went canned instead of fresh it was acceptable for the canned tomatoes to taste like a mixture of crushed red bricks in lemon soap water and to smell like absolutely nothing, no matter how far you stuck your nose inside the can. I never dreamed the possibility that one day I might open a can of tomatoes that would smell and taste like fresh sun kissed tomatoes. I wanted so bad to open a can of tomatoes and smell the tomato smell that anybody whose ever grown tomatoes experiences everyday as they water and brush up against their plants. I wanted so bad to taste the fruity sweet taste of real tomatoes that makes you come to understand why tomatoes are fruits not vegetables. It was because of all my disappointments and expectations above that I started my search for a great canned tomato brand. After much disagreement and uncertainty among canned tomato users, I found my way to Carmelina Italian Peeled Tomatoes in Puree. The reviews on Superstore were great and consistent. The fact that Carmelina does not use preservatives or any other flavors to disguise the true taste of their tomatoes was perfect. I thought I finally found the one great canned tomato that would finally let me create great pizza and pasta sauces. With that last thought, I quickly ordered them with 2day shipping. They arrived about two days prior to making this review. I checked every single can and they were all in perfect condition. Two days later with a recipe and all my ingredients in hand I was ready to make an amazing Neapolitan ragu. I'm sure every one of you looking for a great can of tomatoes ALSO has great recipe that requires great canned tomatoes! Well this amazing ragu was going to be my great recipe. The Ragu uses fresh pork and italian sausages that are simmered in tomato sauce for 8-10 hours and then when the red sauce has absorbed every once of flavor from the meat it is slowly poured over perfectly cooked pasta and then topped with parmesan cheese. Sounds like heaven doesn't it? Today, the date of this review, I got all my ingredients ready and made sure to wake up nice and early to give this ragu plenty of time to make its magic happen. I prepped my meat, olive oil, fresh garlic, and thinly sliced onion. I took out three of the cans. I slowly opened the first one with a huge grin on my face. Just days before my whole family called me crazy for ordering canned tomatoes over the internet and paying $35 bucks plus shipping/handling. Whatever, I would have the last laugh when they are stuffing their faces and asking for seconds. I pushed the lid open with the last twist of the can opener and for a second I was hit with mild disappointment. NO SMELL. But I kicked that thought out of my head and plunged my fingers in the can, picking out a soft peeled tomato. I popped it in my mouth and let a big sigh of disappointment. I opened all three cans to make sure I wasn't going crazy. They all tasted the same. Watery. Tinny. Bitter. All three cans tasted exactly the same. I kept on tasting and tasting hoping that I would have one bite that would prove me wrong. Nope. There is absolutely nothing special about this brand of canned tomatoes. For three out of twelve cans to taste exactly the same means only one thing. I could cross off one more name in my search for a great brand of canned tomatoes. …",8 out of 17 users found this review helpful
" Whoa, Salt and Pepper, in two convenient containers?!?",5,"That's right, two cylinders with two different seasonings. One is white, and filled with salt. One is black, and filled with pepper. Combine the two, and you've got salt and pepper. Salt can be used to make food salty. It can also be used to make water salty too. Some people use salt water as a mouth rinse, and I've got to say, this salt is really salty. The pepper is finely ground and spicy. Used as an inhalant, it creates a burning sensation in the nostrils, often causing the user to sneeze. It works on cats too. …",10 out of 15 users found this review helpful

" A bit different, and wonderful",5,"These peppercorns are a beautiful rosy color, which clues you in before you even get a chance to open the package that they're not the peppercorns you've known all your life. When you do pull open the bag and inhale their aroma, you'll find they combine the scent of pepper with a wonderful fruity, almost floral overtone. It's hard to describe, and even harder to imagine until you've experienced it. The lovely part is that the flavor profile doesn't diminish in use; when I ground and steeped these Sichuan peppercorns for a dark chocolate mousse (grind finely, and steep in the heavy cream for 30 minutes before straining the cream into the chocolate) their vibrant peppery fruit/floral scent was the top note of the mousse. It was a memorably different flavor. Now I'm looking for ways to add them to more dishes, to see what new nuances they can impart to old favorites. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Warning - Low Salt Substitutes are NOT always a Safe substitute for Table Salt,3,"Nu-Salt is not necessarily a safe substitute for table salt and anyone considering using it should FIRST consult with their physician. Nu-Salt, in fact, could make matters worse for some people on a salt restricted diet! Nu-Salt substitutes one salt for another salt. Table salt is sodium chloride and Nu-Salt substitutes that for potassium chloride. Now here is what the Cleveland Clinic says about this type of product (Mayo and Cleveland are generally considered the top two health organizations in the USA): ""Salt substitutes are NOT a healthful option for EVERYONE. Many salt substitutes contain potassium chloride in place of sodium chloride. Potassium consumed in excess may be harmful for some people ... a salt substitute containing potassium chloride is an acceptable alternative in moderation, if you do NOT HAVE kidney problems and have checked with your physician to be sure it will not interact with any of your medications"" Additional research found statements like this: ""salt substitutes are low-sodium alternatives designed to taste similar. They usually contain mostly potassium chloride, whose toxicity is approximately equal to that of table salt in a healthy person ....However, various diseases and medications may decrease the body's excretion of potassium, thereby increasing the risk of potentially FATAL hyperkalemia. People with kidney failure, heart failure or diabetes should NOT use salt substitutes without medical advice. A manufacturer, Lo Salt, has issued an advisory statement"" Note the reference to kidney problems, diabetes and heart failure - the three groups of people most likely to be in need of reducing their salt intake. The likelihood that this product will interact with some typical blood pressure medications is fairly high. The warning about this product possibly interacting with medications should NOT be ignored. I'll conclude with a direct quote from the Nu-Salt web site: ""Please consult with your physician before using Nu-Salt."" I would NOT recommend this product unless you have consulted with your physician first! It clearly takes a physician or other health care professional to decide whether this is a suitable alternative to table salt on an individual basis. …",15 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 What a disappointment,1,"For reference, I've had several Kona coffees before and loved them all. I had high expectations for this coffee after reading the reviews and then after smelling the beans. The smell of the beans is the only good thing about this coffee though. I was skeptical when I saw how very dry the beans were as if they'd been sitting on a shelf for quite a while. I decided to go ahead and make a pot of french pressed coffee regardless. Based on how bad it was (couldn't even finish the cup), I'm guessing that everyone giving this good reviews must be dripping this coffee. Still, I can't imagine that it's very good either way and I have to wonder what kind of coffee is normally drunk by the people who rated this as good. This is nothing like any of the Kona coffees I've had in the past. It's not even close to being on par with the Sumatra I've been drinking lately. If you normally drink pretty good coffee, especially if you grind your own beans that have a nice oily appearance, I'd recommend avoiding this one. I'll probably be throwing the rest of mine out. …",8 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Good alternative to a Buster Cube,5,"This toy takes more effort to get food out than the Buster Cube, which I like because it occupies the dog longer. I find that the cube, even on its ""hardest"" setting only takes a few minutes to get out most of the food, and then the rest doesn't come out no matter how long the dogs work it. With the bottle the dogs can get nearly all the food out if they keep at it. At first you should fill the bottle so that it is over half full. This way food can come out more easily when it is on its side. This will encourage the dog to play with it. Once the food level goes down food will only come out as they toss and pull the bottle. It took my dog a few days to get to this, but now she seems to have mastered it. She stands the bottle up and knocks it over, putting food into the neck, then she works the rope a bit and manages to get a piece of kibble out. When I first got the toy I thought she would never be able to figure it out, but she has. Even so, it takes a fair amount of work to get out just a few pieces of food, so it can keep them occupied all day. …",135 out of 135 users found this review helpful

 Long-lasting flavor in a xylitol gum,5,"I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Cinnamon is by far my favorite. The flavor lasts for longer than any of the other Spry flavors. The warming effect of cinnamon oil also offsets the cooling effect of xylitol, making it not feel as strange in the mouth. I really like that the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. It's great that I can chew this without having intestinal problems. …",34 out of 35 users found this review helpful

To summarize the update: I tried applying the oil topically to the affected area and it stopped the itch and burn completely! Applying the hemp seed oil directly to the area will cure eczema!!! (8/15/2011) __________________________________________________________________________________ Couldn't be happier with this hemp seed oil. The delicious nutty flavor makes it easy to take this as a daily supplement. The texture will take some getting used to if you're taking it straight as a supplement (it is oil after all). And you can't beat the price here on Superstore. The original price is $20 and here it's half that! I actually decided to get this because I heard an omega6 deficiency causes eczema (a skin disease that I have). I've been taking it for about a week and my skin is showing improvement. I itch less and my skin doesn't inflame as badly. I'm thinking I need to up the dose a little bit. Maybe I'll start taking 1 full tablespoon instead of 2 teaspoons that I'm taking daily. I understand this probably won't be of use to most people simply looking for hemp seed oil, but I will update in the comments of this review about how my eczema curing progress is going. Maybe this can help someone. Nutiva is obviously very passionate and dedicated to the products they sell. The label on this oil is informative and their website is even more informative.

 Would never send these poorly repackaged items as a gift!,1,"At first glance, the Snackalicious Food Gift Basket by Back Mountain Baskets looks like your average snackable goodie basket, complete with various nuts, cookies, pretzels, cheese, dried sausage and candy. It's upon closer inspection that we realized that many of the items have in fact been repackaged with tacky glossy paper featuring inferior color Xeroxes of the original labels, poorly wrapped around repurposed cartons. In other words, the ill-fitting glossy paper with the obviously reproduced MmmmPop! All Natural White Cheddar Popcorn label is barely concealing a reused box of Nabisco Wheat Thins Stix. Open that up and you'll find a tiny bag of the promised popcorn. Peel back the paper with the color printer copy of Wege of Hanover Sourdough Hards Pretzels and you'll find an old, taped-up box of Cheez-Its, inside of which is a small package of the pretzels. And lurking behind the paper packaging of the All Natural Fleur De Sel Caramels from France? Mmmm--a box of irresistible Crystal Light Energy drink Mix. Inside that are a handful of the advertised caramels. If all this tacky repurposing was part of some green recycling initiative on the part of Back Mountain, then they should have included a note that explained their company philosophy. But there's no such note--just the feeling that they simply used other boxes so they'd stand up better in the baskets/look more substantial/disguise the fact that some of the items have been divvied up from cost-saving bulk packaging. The end result is something that looks like it was assembled in your own kitchen rather than something you'd order from a presumed legitimate company with the intention of sending to someone as a respectable gift. …",8 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.,5,"UPDATE: The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great. Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution: I have been buying the ""Organic Liver for Dogs"" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Superstore. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product. I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Superstore are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets. As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem. Unfortunately, Superstore doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally). UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me. I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars. I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well. I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars. Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 disappointed,1,"how could i go wrong with all these great reviews. i purchased 1/2 lb of their vanilla beans. my package didn't fill the air with a vanilla aroma as some mentioned. we used in a few recipes and weren't impressed. emailed amit in customer service. amit basically told me to read the reviews. so, i keep reading the reviews....but the vanilla is still not as strong as it should be. i feel like i bought an old batch. …",49 out of 56 users found this review helpful

 Contains SPLENDA - yuck,1,"The product description claims ""It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors."" This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether ""diet"" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the ""Dr. Pepper"": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind. …",24 out of 38 users found this review helpful
 Are you kidding me?????????????,1,"What a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought them in my grocery store because they were on sale. I noticed they were the most expensive ones there so I figured that must be the best there is. How wrong was I. First thing that hit me was how sweet they were. I could barely finish eating. Then I looked at the label and found far too many artificial ingredients. But that's not all. I also bought peach&cream flavor and noticed that peaches and strawberries are strangely similar in taste and shape. After reading a label I found out that they do not even put real strawberries and peaches in the oatmeal. Can you believe that? The most expensive oatmeal on the market and no real fruit. What they do is they put artificially flavored apples in there. Company with such experience in oatmeal making can't afford to give its customers REAL FRUIT? What a shame. I will never buy any of their products. Never!. Oh just to compare what there is available on the market please visit Traders Joe. I found blueberry flavor with REAL blueberries, cranberry with REAL cranberries. So it is possible to make a great product you just have to make an effort QUAKER and stop fooling your customers. …",4 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 so bad I had to write a review,1,"I hope this review helps others save their money or at least have a better idea what to expect and if the product will meet their needs. Traditional style really means fish-in-a-blender--scales, pin-bones, and all. I have a low-salt diet, so salty food tastes really salty to me. However, this is REALLY salty. Almost 1700 mg sodium in the whole can. They could have used half that and been fine. Once you pick out the bones and scales, the meat is appropriately cooked and flaky, even if too salty. A lot of work for a canned product. This may be an appropriate product for under $3 per can, but I felt gypped. If you are being health-conscious, you're probably better off buying a salmon fillet, pulling the pin-bones, and cooking it yourself. …",8 out of 15 users found this review helpful
" Tastes great, controls appetite",5,"Tastes better than 90% of the 'slimming' teas on the market and is NOT a laxative tea. Definitely curbs hunger and makes me less likely to snack, especially in the afternoon when energy levels are getting low. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
