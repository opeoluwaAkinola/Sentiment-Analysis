 Great product!,5,"Ever since I started taking this coconut oil, my skin has improved so much. I take 3 tablespoons a day and it really does make a difference. It's great for soft and healthy looking skin, hair and weight loss (I combine it with cups of green tea as well for the weight loss part). I've ordered this twice so far. Definitely worth it. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Outrageously openly stealing of our money.,1,"I thought I was ordering from a decent company Superstore, but I was wrong. They charged me $38 for only bunch of items but packed very nicely. Items like bunch of popcorn, only may be 50m g of pistachio, 3 candies, 3 to 4 cookies. What is this going one here?? I order 2 similar gifts but your company loot my money. I need to get my money back. I will post the photos of the items which we found inside the package inbeteen bunch of packing paper. THanks, Poonam …",21 out of 23 users found this review helpful
" Terrible! Chemical sweetener, not just honey.",1,"Tea&Honey hmmm sounds like it might be all natural but it's NOT. Before I even opened this box, the smell of it turned me off. I poured this into 20 ounces of water which was even more then the 16 oz it called for and then tasted it, GACK, this is clearly not honey! One swallow and I tasted this in my throat and mouth for an hour and the after taste is horrible. Even the glass I poured it out of, I couldn't get the smell out of even after washing it. This is so putridly sweet I could barely swallow it. I assumed this was as the front of the box said in BIG letters Tea&Honey, well it's not just sweetened with honey. The misleading product labeling did not clearly state that this is full of Sucralose (Nutrasweet by another name) and Maltodextrin two products I would NEVER put in my body knowingly. Both make me sick and give me migraines. Question is WHY? Why would you put artificial garbage, chemical sweetener in green tea that was already sweetened with sugar and honey? Lipton, this product is very misleading. You should Clearly state ""Artificial Sweetener"" and or ""Diet"" on the FRONT of the package so people who care what they put in their bodies won't buy this by mistake. Can't you just keep it all natural? …",41 out of 52 users found this review helpful
" Anne Stewart, RN -AKA Cat lover",5,I have 4 cats and one of them is a 14 wk old kitten. Great to have one type of food that is GOOD for any age cat. / They took to the food without any complaints. 2 of my cats are very stomach sensitive and have allergies but with this NEW food we've had no adjustment issues./ Despite the higher costs for this food.... it is worth every penny. To know that this food does not have the wheat gluten present that has killed so many other animals. I love my pets and it would just be the the worst thing I could imagine to serve them some food that would cause them harm or death./I HIGHLY recommend this product!!! …,16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 good stuff,5,"this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my **** and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around, yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Absolutely loving this!!,5,"I've always been a loyal ZICO coconut water fan, and so was extremely excited to hear about the new packaging...and I have to say that I was MORE than pleased! The new blend that they use reminds me more of the Thai coconuts I grew up drinking and the bottles make it so convenient for me to carry around with me since I'm always on the go. The concentrate does not bother me at all, as after doing some research online, my negative opinion of the term has completely been changed. It doesn't mean that it's not natural or that anything is added - it simply means that they have taken the water out and shipped over just the goodness (which by the way, is WAY more environmentally friendly than shipping water across the world!!) and added back the water through reverse osmosis. Hey, if you're a POM or Sambazon fan - then you know that they are from concentrate too! The flavors are super yummy too! I'm in love with the Pomberry. Another thumbs up about the bottle? It's 100% recyclable!! YUP! 100% - including the cap! There aren't too many products out there where you can recylce the cap. Also, it's made from number 2 plastic which means that it's made from recylced materials. I used to find it hard to recylce the carton packaging, as not many facilities knew how to recycle it since it's made from so many different materials. Two thumbs up on the new packaging and the new taste profile!! Now only if they came out with more flavors... …",8 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 New morning pleasure,5,"I love this French Vanilla cappuccino! It is exactly what I was looking for to make in my Keurig. You see, I am NOT a coffee drinker so I am always on the look out for tea or other speacialty drinks to make in my Keurig. This would be similar to the Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha and Chai Latte. It is a mix that fully emties when you run it through the Keuirg. A word of warning to the die hard coffee drinkers...this is not your Starbucks cappuccino. It's more like your gas station cappuccino, which was exactly what I was looking for. Great taste even on the largest cup setting on the Keurig platinum.

 Not a nice assortment,2,"I have wanted to try flavored coffee but didn't want to take the chance of buying a whole box and not likely the flavor. This was a good solution. I read the few reviews and took chance. Well I'm a little dissapointed. Most of the box expires by December which isn't to big of deal because I'll have them gone by then, but the assortment sucked. At least a third of them were the same flavor from the same maker. When you add that to the number of ""french vanilla"" ones that I got it's at least 2/3 of the box. I wanted an assortment, not mostly french vanilla made by a few different companies. I think I have 5 or 6 that weren't french vanilla. Oh and top it off, those 5 or 6 are the only different brands too. The rest of the box is Van Houtte coffee. …",144 out of 149 users found this review helpful

 **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************,2,"First off, the initial arrival: It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat! Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary. Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective; 1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces 2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several. 3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging. In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags. Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's. Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way. But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Superstore charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping). If you wanted to buy using Superstore Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings. An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats …",1 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Great product! No hormones or antibiotics in the meat!,5,"I adopted my dog about 6 months ago and he had digestive problems that the vet could find no cause for. He would get diarrhea with mucous in stools regularly. His stools would vary from constipated to unformed soft stool. I decided to switch him to a better quality food and did a lot of research. Newman's Own had all the qualities I was looking for, so I switched him to it gradually - 1/2 Purina One and 1/2 Newman's Own at first and gradually more Newmans' Own in the mix until finally 100% N.O. Ever since switching about six weeks ago, he has not had constipation or loose stools. I also don't hear his tummy roiling after meals like before. And despite what a few reviewers have written, the chicken and beef used in the pet food, while not ""organic"", is ""natural"" and raised without hormones and antibiotics. According to [...] ingredients list: ""Natural Chicken - Raised without growth hormones and antibiotics and fed only a 100% natural, all-vegetable diet, the chicken meat provides amino acids essential for muscles, hormones, enzymes, antibodies and structural and protective tissues."" Also, the beef is free-range anad range fed w/ no hormones & antibiotics.

" too easy, even for ""not-so-smart"" dogs",2,"i called up Kyjen customer service for a recommendation on a puzzle toy, and *bonus* got a iive person on the phone (brownie points for great service). I have a mini dachshund, who, although adorable, is not so bright and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item, my dachshund figured it out within minutes---i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly! Unfortunately, I wanted this toy to last for a while but this one unfortunately is too easy. See, If you spin the star just 20 degrees, *all* the treat trays are exposed, and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dogs playtime and challenge them further. However, my dog does love other Kyjen Toys -- the Tail Teaser, Egg Babies platypus and Hide-A-Squirrel in the junior size. Based on the great customer service and other toys, i will try some different Kyjen puzzle games instead. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Excellent Source of Magnesium,5,"If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too. I've also tried a flavored version of this product (Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder). Unlike that version, this stuff is entirely odorless, and the only taste is a sense of tartness. I much prefer this non-flavored version over the flavored version. The only problem I have with this product is that it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage. That's pretty insignificant. So, I still rate it at an Excellent five stars out of five. Highly recommended. Especially if you're taking calcium. …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful

These bars are maybe 1 1/2"" wide, 4"" long, and 1/4"" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think. Anyway, now you know.

 Best of the Belgian Machine-made Chocolates,5,"Introduced to Leonidas several years ago, on successive trips to Brussels I returned with the two other, more well-known brands (Godiva and Neuhaus), when I couldn't get to Leonidas before my plane left. My wife advised me that in the future it was Leonidas or nothing. They are machine-made so the price is not bad (as opposed to the hand-made varieties), but they are also made fresh without preservatives so they need to be eaten or refrigerated quickly. In this house, the refrigerator rarely sees the package. They are excellent and a treat you owe yourself. …",40 out of 41 users found this review helpful

 Amazing results with this food!,5,"We tried this food after our 1-year-old Bengal kitten began to develop symptoms of food allergies (gas, bloating, constipation, vomiting). We've been feeding Core for about 4 months now, and she has been symptom-free since the end of the first week! In addition, our 7-year-old cat has also had remarkable and unexpected results. She has dropped weight, her eyes are bright, kitty acne on her chin has cleared, and she acts like a playful kitten again! Other notes about this food: -Core costs more than our previous food (Pet Promise), but they don't scarf it down like the old food. They get excited and eat for a few minutes any time the bowl is filled, but then they just return to nibble from time to time. So, a bag of Core lasts longer. Perhaps this is because they are getting the protein they need without having to eat pounds of food! -This food smells like fish meal, and tends to give them slightly stinky breath, but it is not overpowering. -Small, round kibble is crunchy, but not as hard and dry as most commercial dry foods. Our picky eater had no problem with the transition. Overall, I would strongly recommend this food. I'm in awe of the truly priceless health changes we have seen in our cats, and only wish we had made the switch years ago! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 A Delicious and Effective Energy Drink,5,"Red Bull (as everyone knows) basically started the buzz on energy drinks. It's full of B-vitamins, a bit of sugar (and a nice blast of caffeine just for good measure.) What makes this more popular than every other energy drink? It's CONSISTENTLY effective and NEVER overbearing. Red Bull isn't very sweet, and as such it goes down wonderfully at any time... It's a bit tart (which can take getting used to if you're a soda drinker) but generally has a very pleasing flavor. Plus, you know every time you pop open a can of Red Bull, you will get the desired result. Much like coffee, Red Bull is a tried and true boost that many swear by. My only reservation in recommending this drink is the artificial ingredients, which I feel bring the level of quality down a little bit... In my opinion, a drink that costs this much should use 100% natural ingredients... That being said, at least the original Red Bull uses natural sugar and is free of nasty preservatives. Highly recommended! …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Darker than expected,3,"I loved the flavor and strength of the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend. Since the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend was not available on Superstore, I shopped for the next best thing. I thought it would be a great idea to purchase the 1/2 caff, and perhaps I would get the same great flavor, same milder coffee and quality as the regular Green Mountain I was used to (with half the caffine). WRONG. Although still a perfectly drinkable coffee, the 1/2 caff seems to be a darker roast and not nearly as mild as the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend. Actually tasted bitter, as compared to it's fully caffinated counterpart. Priced well and free shipping as an Superstore Prime member, so that's a plus. I won't throw it out, but did go right out shopping for the Breakfast Blend I was used to. This box of Half-Caff will be for ""emergency"" use for me. …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Name is misleading,2,"The name of this product is a bit misleading. Most people assume that if peanut butter is labeled ""natural"" that the only ingredients are peanuts (though some manufacturers add a little salt to their natural peanut butter, too). Skippy, however, also adds sugar and extracts the peanut oil and replaces it with palm oil. I don't believe most people would think that something made from peanuts would ""naturally"" contain palm oil. So while Skippy is technically correct in labeling this ""natural"" since it does not contain any artificial ingredients, I think they're consciously taking advantage of the fact that most people would think ""natural"" peanut butter just contains peanuts and its byproducts. …",40 out of 55 users found this review helpful
" Outstanding flavor, great price!",5,"After years of using Starbuck's decaf and regular single serving espresso pods, I finally found a substitute that's more economical and MUCH better tasting.<p>I've used three different brands of pods in my Starbuck's Barista machine, and have found that the quality of the pod and the flavor of the espresso inside is, by far, the best in the Espressione pods. The flavor is more full bodied and stronger than in the Starbuck's pods. I actually use one pod to make two shots of espresso, and the flavor is more intense than when I buy my specialty drinks from Starbucks or other coffee houses.<p>Also, the pod itself is of very high quality. Each pod is individually wrapped in an airtight, hard foil wrapper, and I've never opened a package yet that contained a torn pod with coffee spilling out. Such is not the case with other lesser brands.<p>The tab on each pod is also handy, making it easier to switch out a hot spent pod with a new one when making a second round of espresso. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Is this a whole grain rice?,3,Good tasting product - but doesn't seem to be whole grain rice. This rice simply seems brown - but does not have any fibre (0 g of fibre on the nutrient composition label). This is no fault of the company as they do not advertise it as whole grain rice - but when you read other reviews you think it may be. I really wish Superstore would post the nutrient profile of the food items they sell like many grocery stores do so you know what it is before the item arrives. Lundberg has a variety of whole grain rices for a similar price and are really tasty (although they take longer to cook because they are whole grain) they have about 3 g of fibre per serving according to the nutrition label. …,10 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" Excellent quinoa product, not the best value",4,"Quinoa is a great food. It is very versatile so almost anyone could make it in a way they found appealing... it's easy to cook and easy to experiment with, and best of all, it is good for you. I agree with others that Bob's Red Mill has the best Quinoa product... at least the best that I've tried. It's prewashed which is a big convenience over unwashed quinoa, and you can count on the quality (I recently bought some red quinoa in the bulk bin from the local natural grocers and there was something crunchy in the totally cooked quinoa... I couldn't stand it). This deal on Superstore is a slightly better deal than you are likely to get on Bob's Red Mill quinoa in stores. It typically sells for $9-$11 per 26 oz bag. So this deal works out to just under $9 a bag. Unfortunately Bob's Red Mill does not sell their 25 lb bags on Superstore, which is by far their best value. The 25 lb bag for me came out to $86.05 with shipping, though that may depend on your location. If you are serious about quinoa as a staple of your diet and you'd eventually eat that much, here's the math: This deal works out to $5.53 per pound of quinoa, while bulk works out to $3.44 per pound. If you eventually bought the same amount of quinoa via these 4 26 ounce packages you'd spend $138.25. So you'd save $52.20 going bulk. A skilled google searcher can find where to get it 25 lb bags of quinoa from Bob's Red Mill, but hopefully Bob's Red Mill and Superstore will work out a way to sell them through Superstore. …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Not a Bad Fat Anymore,5,"Excellent product!! I have found that coconut oil can be used in any way you would use oil or butter. It has a very mild coconut flavor----nothing that would really alter the taste of what you're preparing. It can take high heat cooking without breaking down. (All the benefits of olive oil are destroyed with high heat). It doesn't need refrigeration----another plus. Tastes great on toast. Too bad the good things about coconut oil have been surpressed for so many years. It seems to be one of the healthy fats instead of all the synthetics (e.g. margarine) and hydrogenated products on the market. Must be organic, unprocessed, & cold pressed to have all the good benefits. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Fabulous Chocolate covered gummy bears!!!!,5,"I've been a gummy fanatic since gummy's hit the specialty stores in the 80's & then branched out in drugstores, grocery stores, movie theaters, etc. and I can tell you about every gummy brand company, flavor, shape, style, etc. because they are my passion. It was love at first taste when they came out in the 80's and I was a young girl. That being said, I'm also a gummy snob. I like my gummy's to have that perfect gummy taste and texture. I don't want my gummy to have a Swedish fish consistency or an over chewy, overly additive tasted and artificially flavored that lasts on your tongue and leaves your hands sticky! (that being said Swedish fish are delicious but have their place in a different candy catogory) That's a big NO! If you're a gummy expert and you love gummy's like I do, then you will understand exactly what I'm talking about. I have bought many Chocolate covered Gummy Bears over the years, both white and milk chocolate which I like equally depending on my mood. I have bought chocolate gummy bears both from upscale candy stores and from the one that comes packaged in a box typically sold in drugstores. I have had every gummy both regular and chocolate over the years and I love them both and enjoy them equally. I eat the regular ones more often because they won't put a dent in my diet and I save the chocolate ones for special occasions. I also don't eat the chocolate ones as often because they are hard to purchase for me geographically. In fact, I have to resort to purchasing them off of the internet if I want my chocolate covered gummy fix! These gummy's both white and milk chocolate are the best I've ever tasted! The chocolate stays on even after being shipped to me, which chocolate often comes off if it's not a quality chocolate, but these chocolate gummy bears are pan flashed which means they are covered thoroughly and drenched in the chocolate and not made in mass quantities. The gummy's are put through the process in small amounts so that no gummy is missed and the panning effect is only used with the finest chocolate companies. These gummy's are the best gummy's I've ever tasted and I've tasted many gummy bears over the years. You will not be disappointed! I try to keep my ordering of these fabulous gummy's to only special occasions or holidays, but they're so good that I'm finding myself making excuses to celebrate so I can buy these sinful but so delicious little bears of chocolate goodness more often! The chocolate tastes fresh and you can tell that the recipe is of the finest chocolate quality. There is nothing I despise more in the chocolate world than cheap chocolate! These gummy's are on the opposite spectrum of cheap & generic tasting! These gummy's are the best! You will never need to buy chocolate covered gummy bears anywhere else! I'm sold and I will always be a loyal fan. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

" Grain-free, & the protein isn't too much too handle",5,"**Update: March 2012** I still feed this grain free kibble to my shelties, they still love it and I'm still very happy with it. I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids. For some reason, my younger sheltie's tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn't have gas at all. Woohoo! So now I'm able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to. I think I've been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy. By the way, buying directly from Superstore for this item says ""Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks"", but 1-2 days after I order I'll get an update email from Superstore saying something like ""Good news - We're able to ship this sooner than we thought! Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered."" And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering. **Original review** I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Superstore has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety? My younger sheltie has epilepsy. Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet. Canidae is only part of that diet; I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4"" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals. The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies. I know, it's complicated, right? But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this. I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty. I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had **** gland problems where she'd have an **** sac blowout at least once a month. So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed. (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.) Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has **** gland issues. Their teeth are cleaner too. I didn't want this to turn into a ""raw food is the only way to go"" preaching session, I swear! But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her **** glands work like they're supposed to. Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does. However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it. If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food. For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food. The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles. I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid. So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS. I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it. The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right? I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do. As I write this, Superstore's price is the same as my local natural pet store. As much as I'd like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it's a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Superstore. Ingredients: Chicken meal, turkey meal, lamb, potatoes, peas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), lamb meal, ocean fish meal, tomato pomace, natural flavor, choline chloride, suncured alfalfa meal, inulin (from chicory root), lecithin, sage extract, cranberries, beta-carotene, rosemary extract, sunflower oil, yucca schidigera extract, dried enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried lactobacillus casei fermentation product, dried lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid, papaya, pineapple. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 What a great find!,5,"I absolutely love Superstore and practically 'hang out' on Superstore like some people do on Facebook - LOL! That being said, I really enjoy reading the reviews and the comments of fellow Amazoners and learn so much by doing so. I really appreciate the information that other reviewers include and when I have found a particular reviewer that I recognize over and over again, I have clicked on their profile to read more about them and about what other items they have reviewed and BOY has that been fun! And that is precisely how I stumbled upon this Amazing Grass Green Superfood mix! I was reading the profile of another reader and she raved about it. Well, any time I am out of my green powder, I order a different brand. This way, I am always using a different product and can try them all out and see which one I really do like the best and will stay with. As timing would have it, I was almost out of the one I was using, and saw this review, and ordered it! I signed up for the Auto-delivery (as you can cancel at any time) and it reduced the price as well as free shipping - yay! But, the real test was in the flavor, and it's blendability (new word?). It shakes up well (shake, not stir), and the taste is pretty good. I add it to smoothies, or drink plain in water or juice and like it either way. It seems to be economically doable for me, possibly lasting 60 days, so that is a better deal than most out there. I felt better immediately after drinking it - with more energy - probably due to the Maca. Maca is something you want to research before taking, and certainly before ever giving to children. I have some Maca in a bag, and when I have added only a tiny bit of it to a smoothie - I didn't like the way it made me feel at all, and it made my heart go a little crazy, so IMO, be cautious. This, however, gave me a burst of good-feeling energy without the heart palpitations of other ill-effects, so I was happy. All in all, I think I have found my favorite green drink so I'm sticking with it and if I have any other opinions, I'll update my review. I think you'll like it too! …",73 out of 75 users found this review helpful

 Great Product and Convenient As Well,5,"These four-packs of vegetable broth are a great product to use for making soups or to add extra flavor when making polenta, risotto, long-grain rice or quinoa. Each box contains 8 ounces of broth (one cup), so each four-pack contains the same total amount as one 32-ounce box of broth. Normally, these four-packs are more expensive than one 32-ounce box in supermarkets, but Superstore has a pretty good price on them -- $3.11 per four-pack (per quart). They are very convenient to use as well, because you never have to freeze or store unused broth in the fridge, as is often the case with 32-ounce broth boxes. Since each box has one cup of broth, you don't need to measure, and you only use as much as you need. …",25 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 False Labeling!!,1,"This stuff is called ""Cook's Organic PURE Vanilla Powder"" but it's definitely nothing of the sort. First of all, anyone should be weary of a ""pure"" vanilla powder that isn't dark brown/blackish in color. That should be the first give away. Cook's PURE Vanilla Powder is a white powder, and anyone who takes a moment to read the ingredient list should not be surprised to find that the #1 ingredient in this ""PURE"" Vanilla powder is, in fact, sucrose. That's right folks, it's sugar. Corn sugar. Cook's calls this product ""a revolutionary vanilla and the first real alternative to pure vanilla extract"" but the truth is there is nothing revolutionary here, and this is a horrible alternative to a perfectly fine product such as pure vanilla extract. As white as this powder appears by looking at the jar, one has to wonder just how much vanilla powder is actually even in there. It can't be much. Or maybe they bleached it? Anyone willing to shell out $55 for 4.9lbs. of corn sugar with a splash of vanilla will be very pleased with this product, but if one were to actually care about their health and well-being, it would be wise to stay clear of this product and purchase some REAL vanilla powder or a vanilla extract instead. (They do make vanilla extract without alcohol, for those trying to avoid it.) What we can learn from a product like this is the importance of reading labels. Always read the labels of products you intend on purchasing. Lesson learned? This stuff's junk. Go with another product. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Good X-Bold Dark Roast for the Price,4,"Really my title sums up my opinion of this cup altogether. It does make a nice, heart large cup of dark roast coffee, and $25 for 48 cups as the preorder price was outstanding. At that price, I don't think I've ever really seen better, but at the same time the brew doesn't seem quite as bold or earthy tasting as a cup of Green Mountain Dark Magic or Emeril's Big Easy Bold. I prefer a robust large cup on almost every brew, and I've realized that even the Ice Brew K-Cups are basically the same thing; a cup of coffee with extra grounds for brewing a small amount stronger...so I brew iced coffee with my Extra Bold k-cups. I did the math on weight, and these weigh in at just under a cup of Dark Magic or Sumatran Reserve, but I'd still say my favorites (by taste,) are the brands I've listed above or Tully's Italian or French Roast, Caribou Obsidian, Starbucks Dark Sumatra, or even Barista Prima French and Italian Roasts. The only other thing I can note about these is that the construction of the pods is about perfect; I didn't find any grinds in the box leaving me to believe there were no leaking pods. Almost all the pods had a little air puffing the foil out; which I've noticed a lot of the Keurig brands have flat foils, anyways, so I'm not even sure if it matters that much, although I've had grinds brew through on some of the flat pods. The only other difference I can mention is the material of the foil top is different than Keurig brand pods; these are slightly harder and smoother (almost like a plastic or polymer,) but it doesn't seem to effect the brew process at all, and I didn't seem to get any grinds in my cup, so all in all it just doesn't matter to me. Still better than brewing through a regular coffee pot (even from fresh ground beans,) and I don't think I'll ever get tired of my Keurig coffee maker. …",16 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Geat no frills superautomatic espresso maker,5,"We've owned this machine for 11 months and therefore can provide a longer term review. Please note we bought this on sale at Costco for $350, but it's worth more. Ease of use: while this is a superautomatic, don't assume you can brew a perfect cup of coffee/espresso with no experimentation. This isn't a Keurig. The advantage of superautomatics is ease of use and consistency once you've optimized brewing. Similar to semi-automatic espresso machines, you do have control over your final product. You still have to find the correct coffee grind setting/amount, etc. You still need to aim for a 25 second extraction time. Once you do, though, you'll have great results each and every time. Maintenance: this machine requires minimal daily maintenance. The water reservoir is small so have a water pitcher handy. Fresh water is ideal for brewing anyway. Ditto for the coffee bean hopper. But again, who wants beans sitting out going stale? Weekly maintenance involves cleaning the brew group. This is easy. Every 2-3 months the machine should be descaled. This does require time. Taste: we are big fans of french press coffee for its richness of flavor. This is the first ""coffee machine"" that can best a french press with less effort, less cleanup, and more consistency. The coffee is makes is excellent (termed coffee crema as it retains crema on the top), and I find it difficult to drink coffee outside the home now. The espresso it makes is equally excellent. It surpasses Starbuck's with ease, and is equivalent to espresso you'll get from most cafes. However, it's not as good as you'll find at an Intelligentsia, or similar quality cafe. But it's quite consistent. Don't forget that beans are an important variable. Try black cat espresso from Intelligentsia, preferably roasted only a few weeks in advance. Milk frothing: anywhere from adequate to very good. Definitely depends on type of milk and skill. I can usually make quite good foam, but it can't do true microfoam. Quality/workmanship: plastic outer casing and plastic brew group. Looks flimsy, but has held up over the past year. It makes a strange high pitched noise while brewing, probably from the where the coffee comes out (likely just our machine) but we've otherwise not had problems. Also, it's the same brew group used in their other machines, so taste should be equivalent to more expensive machines. Features: this is bare bone. No timer, no computer presets. But this is also why the price point is so good. You get a great espresso maker and decent grinder for a relatively low price. Speed: warms up from turn on in 2-3 minutes. Then takes (with grinding) from about 35-40 sec for espresso to a bit longer for a cup of coffee (can make a full american sized cup). Warm up for steaming is quick. To then brew after steaming takes only about 15 seconds as long as you purge hot water. So getting to know how the machine works is important. Summary: fantastic consistent coffee, excellent espresso with nice crema, and very good steaming at a great price. A great barista with a high end grinder and high end semi-automatic can probably make better espresso, but this is great for the rest of us. And early in the morning this is what you want. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Delicious and nutricious!,5,"I like protein bars conceptually - something to grab as you rush out - I go to a lot of 6 pm meetings, and plan to eat dinner when they end, but by then I'm ravenous, and I need something to hold me through them. So I've tried a lot of bars and frankly they range around mediocre, pretending to be something (chocolate!)that they are clearly not. So what are these bars like? Great! Really delicious - full of nuts you can see and taste, not too sweet, as often these bars are, and it has protein! A happy find, we bought a box and will buy more, I can see it becoming a staple in our cupboards. May 2010 - on to my third order, so this is a really great snack in our house. The protein really does help fill you up, it's a perfect snack, and all of us think it's delicious (though my son does prefer the macadamia passionfruit, this one has protein and that makes it a much better bar for me and my husband and our low sugar tendencies) …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Be Careful,2,"This food has EXTREMELY high levels of protein. Not all dogs need a high protein diet, and in fact for some it can be quite dangerous. While my dog was on Orijen, my vet discovered that he had elevated liver enzymes. Many dog food health websites advocate high protein foods, but these can be very dangerous. Dogs that don't have a lot of energy and/or have little body fat (like sighthounds) do not need this much protein, and processing it can be very bad for their livers. This is a high quality food, I love that it is made by a small company in Canada, and many people have had great success with it. But know that it is NOT for every dog! Please be careful and keep in mind that more protein is not always better if you are considering this food! …",41 out of 52 users found this review helpful

 Incredible flavor and texture brown rice,5,This rice blend is the best tasting rice i have ever experienced. I use a zoji rice cooker with fuzzy logic set on the brown rice setting. Iuse canned swanson chicken stock instead of water and put butter in the bowl before cooking. The net result is a mind blowing goodness that is nutty and extremely flavorful. The texture is also very pleasing. This is a great blend. If you want great reviews on your dinner presentation then this should be part of your dinner plate.

While it doesn't deliver on its Concerto promise, it does give you reassuring clicks when a vacuum has been reached, enabling you to stop pumping sooner.

" Great taste, fun to chew, strong scientific backing for health claims of Xylitol",5,"After using an ""all-natural"" gum (that contained cane sugar) and getting my first cavity in 12 years after 6 months of use, I knew I needed a switch. I heard about Xylitol from a naturopathic student, that basically, the bad bacteria in your mouth feed on Xylitol but they can't digest it, and the good bacteria can eat it, so they proliferate. I thought I had tried other Xylitol gums in the past and didn't like them, but I decided to give this another chance because I want a gum to chew after meals that is actually good for my teeth. I was pleasantly surprised at the Spry gum! It has a great flavor (which goes away pretty soon after chewing, but it's a nice shot of good taste), but the best part is that the gum itself has a great texture to it and continues to be fun to chew for as long as you want. It doesn't even turn hard after drinking water like most gums do. I am a medical student so I did a search of the research literature and the claims of Xylitol are more than proven. However, all of the literature and research studies explain that you need 4-12 g of Xylitol a day (no need to get more than 15), but the average piece of gum has .75-1 g, so you'll need to chew at least 4-5 pieces a day to get the dental benefits (chewing it only sporadically, i.e. once a day, did NOT show any dental benefits). No problem for me, I chew one after every meal (I have 5-6 a day), and love having the fresh clean feeling as well as knowing that I'm doing something great for my teeth. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Small and Plastic...not glass,1,"I just received this today and I am greatly disappointed. Here is why (Cons) *Not glass - I know it says ceramic grinder, and yes, the actual grinding part is ceramic. The clear part is plastic. I thought it was glass, and ordered because I am trying to get rid of plastics due to a hormone imbalance. *Small - It looked larger in the photo than it really is. The grinder is less than 6.5"" from the very bottom of the grinder to the top of the knurl. *Crooked - The top sits crooked on the grinder. *Expensive - If the grinder were glass and larger, this would be a good value. With it being plastic and small, it is greatly overpriced. My suggestion is - Buy a glass grinder and order a bulk coarse Himalayan Sea Salt to grind in it. *Not enough of the Himalayan Salt to make it worth the price. (Pros) *Excellent salt, that is why I suggest buying the Himalayan Sea Salt in bulk and purchasing a better grinder. I made this review to help others who are trying to rid their environment of plastics and heal their system from hormone imbalances. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Really Quite Something!!,5,"I stumbled onto Manuka Honey last year and I was really blown away by all of the claims that were being made about this honey. My family eats a lot of honey and we have really made serious changes to our diets in recent years. We no longer eat processed food, get all of our meats & produce from organic CSA farms and we are constantly on the look out for ways to further improve our diets. After reading about Manuka Honey, I simply had to give it a try. The brand I ordered was Wedderspoon Active 16+. To say that I was impressed is an understatement as the flavor is absolutely to die for. It has a very unique taste. To be honest, its the best honey I have ever had. I am a yogurt junkie and started making homemade yogurt a couple years back. Sprinkling some Manuka Honey over homemade yogurt is simple amazing. Its hands down the best yogurt topping I have ever tried and I have tried almost everything. The unique taste of Manuka honey blends perfectly with yogurt. Throw some granola in there and again its absolutely to die for. One of the other things I use it for regularly is on toast. We buy fresh bread every other day from our local bakery and Manuka Honey on fresh toasted bread is just as amazing as the yogurt. As for its antibacterial claims, its absolutely 100% true. My wife has a very mild case of eczema but a couple times a year it acts up and can get pretty bad. The episodes usually last a week or two. She literally has like 10+ different kinds of hand lotion specifically aimed at treating Eczema. When I first told her about Manuka Honey she was extremely skeptical, in regards to what it could do for her skin, but since we already had some she said she would give it a try. Sure enough like 6 weeks later her Eczema stated acting up, mostly on her hands. Before she went to bed She applied a very light coating over the affected areas and then put on a pair of my Light Impressions cotton gloves. I use the gloves when matting or handling my photography prints. They are extremely light and are made of 100% cotton. It only took 2 nights of this and her hands were back to normal. She was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. To give you an idea of just how impressed she was, she wound up ordered 6 more bottles that same week. Since then she has had multiple outbreaks and each and every time she uses the Manuka Honey. Her collection of hand lotions are doing nothing but collecting dust. Bottom line - Manuka Honey is good for you, tastes great and it has anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral properties. Its like liquid gold. It now has a permanent spot on our shelves. Yes, it is more expensive than regular honey but this is one of the cases where you get what you pay for. Its absolutely worth every last penny. This is one train you want to get on. 5 Stars and then some!! …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Getting away from Weruva may have saved my cat's life.,1,"I started feeding my 17-year-old cat Weruva a little over a year ago when she got bored with her old food. She's a picky eater, so when I opened the first can and she started yowling ""Give it to me NOW"" like Veruca Salt, I figured I had a winner. The vet we had at the time - hereafter known as Old Vet - didn't see anything wrong with it, so Weruva became her diet. Kitty, who has always been a pudgy little picture of health, started losing weight last year. Old Vet was not concerned at first and certainly did not attribute her weight loss to her food. However, when it progressed from half a poiund, to one, to more than three, a battery of tests was clearly in order. At that point (July) Kitty was diagnosed with a hyperthyroid and kidney disease. Frequent visits to Old Vet for diagnosis and treatment began... lots of fun, as you can imagine. Food was again not deemed to be a problem. A month ago Kitty started having continual problems with her bowels and developed a raging kidney infection. Old Vet put her on an antibiotic. Symptoms worsened. She appeared to be in rapid decline and was thoroughly miserable. The antibiotic only made a slight difference, and Old Vet wasn't giving us helpful answers, so we went to see New Vet. New Vet ordered more blood work (fourth draw of the year - oh boy). When New Vet got the results, she immediately prescribed another course of antibiotics, and a new prescription diet. Whoda thunk? It's been one week, and hallelujah! Kitty's recovery has been drastic. I feel like we dodged a bullet... and now I have 40 cans of Weruva to get rid of. I can't prove that Weruva is the culprit for my cat's health problems, and I absolve neither Old Vet nor myself for missing the connection to baby's diet. But given the whole timeline, I simply cannot believe Weruva wasn't the biggest factor. Weruva because weluvya? Don't think so! …",6 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" Liars, liars...",1,"Be warned: although the FDA label claims ""0g trans fat"" the ingredients tell a different story, as ""partially hydrogenated coconut or palm kernel"" is the first ingredient listed. This is a poison that is now outlawed in New York restaurants, and if you are careful about what you eat you want to make sure you stay away from this. As it turns out, they can claim ""0g trans fat"" because the content is less than 1g per serving, but it's a technicality: the product contains a significant amount of trans fat. Obviously, you're not going to drop dead from using a teaspoon in your coffee once, but regular, prolonged use is detrimental to your health.

 Sulfite Free Dehydrated Fruit ...,5,"I first encountered these crisps a couple of years ago when visiting my sister in California. Sadly, I was unable to obtain them locally when I returned home. I have a sulfite allergy and have a difficult time finding packaged fruit that I can safely eat, so the Brother's Crisps were an exciting treasure. When I recently found them on Superstore, I immediately ordered a combination pack Variety Pack Crisps, Fuji Apple, Asian Pear, Strawberry/Banana, 24-Count Bags , which includes the Strawberry / Banana Crisps, which have become my very favorite! These are ""freeze-dried fruit"" - meaning they simply have all the moisture removed from them. They remind me of the ""Space meals"" that were popular during the space era, and which are still available at some locations. Since there is no added sugar, the strawberries are tart, and as expected, the bananas are sweet. Together, they remind me of a ""freeze-dried smoothie."" With only 45 calories, this is a great little snack that packs a big punch, and because it is freeze-dried, it weighs in at about 1/2 ounce - awesome for hiking or backpacking. Each package contains approx. 1 Banana and 4 Strawberries. These are Peanut/Tree Nut Free * Gluten Free * Soy Free * Dairy Free * Non GMO * Vegan * and Kosher.

Nature's Path describes this as ""...cereal of flax, corn and amaranth."" Now look at the ingredients which, of course, are listed from most to least. The first 2 are cornmeal and corn flour--hardly the most nutritious of grains. Third is organic evaporated cane juice yielding 4 grams of sugar per serving, and then come the flax, buckwheat, quinoa and amaranth. JUST HOW MUCH OF THESE SUPER GRAINS CAN POSSIBLY BE INCLUDED if the 3rd highest ingredient is the sugar at 4 grams?! And that's another pet peeve: why any added sugar at all. Most health-conscious consumers do not want added sugars, even cane juice. And this also leads me to question the ""nutrition facts"" posted on the products.

 a good start to your day-even when you don't have much time...,5,"This is one of my favorite in the Erin Baker line of Breakfast cookies, the cookie has an oatmeal base but is not a ""heavy"" cookie. It is nice and moist and has little pieces of caramel in the cookie. I like the fact that the cookie packs a lot in a little package- 280 calories for this cookie, no transfat, 20% of your daily fiber, no cholesterol and chock full of healthy ingredients to get you started (it does however have 23 gr. of sugar, so if you are looking for low sugar, this probably isn't for you). I have to say I was skeptical that this would carry me to lunch because it is just one large cookie, and not like one of those overly heavy, hockey puck like items you expect when you see something is full of fiber, it also didn't have that saw dust kind of texture you get from some power bars. This definitely has enough of the right stuff to keep me full for several hours. My favorite way to eat these cookies are to stick them in the microwave for 20-25 seconds so they get soft and the caramel melts just a little. I pretty much like all of the flavors, but overall this one is probably my most favorite. The other nice thing is that these cookies are meant to freeze and can freeze up to a year. The box of twelve cookies are all individually wrapped and I take them straight from freezer to microwave, for a quick, nutritious breakfast that is both satisfying and delicious.

 Great Concept... Weak Processor,2,"I typically am not a big proponent of single-purpose specialty gadgets, but the Babycook was appealing to me for convenience. The product does deliver in that it significantly reduces dishes/clean up - however the processing function is surprisingly weak. To puree steamed chunks of carrots takes far longer to pulse than what the manual implies. I have to pulse & scrape down multiple times before foods are completely pureed - something I would definitely not have to do with a food processor or even a blender. I was very surprised not to have seen this shortcoming mentioned in reviews as of yet, but perhaps my expectations are a bit higher because I do cook on a very frequent basis. Although I love the idea of having an easy machine to whip up fresh baby food, I'll likely return it and use a steamer + food processor for better results. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful

" There are better tasting, healthier alternatives",1,"I used Imagine Rice beverages for many years. I favored them for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. Enriched has extra nutrition and is organic. However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products, including their Heart-Wise line of products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a known toxic long-chain fatty acid. The USA FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and does not allow it in infant formula. In addition, medical studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic to humans and animals in high enough amounts (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs. Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications at the end of this review. This is a highly controversial subject, but concerns can be based on genuine medical research and not simply superstition, gullibility or hysteria. The FDA still approves at this time PABA food containers for people and infants, but they are not allowed in Canada due to documented toxic effects; this (and a hundred other examples) shows that FDA approval is not always the last word in food safety! Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free. I find it to be less sweet, less chalky, and more milk-like in flavor. The least expensive canola free rice milk I have found is Whole Foods ""365"" brand, which is more watery than other brands but tastes fine. (Some of the Good Karma products on Superstore have canola listed as an ingredient, but I believe that is outdated information. The Good Karma website and the products themselves do not list canola as an ingredient at this time.) I use ""365"" for cooking because it is inexpensive, and Good Karma for drinking straight because of its rich milk flavor and texture. The Good Karma chocolate flavor is super delicious and is very sweet, but unfortunately contains cane sugar rather than rice-based sweeteners. Some Imagine products and all the Good Karma products are also organic and made from whole grain (that is, brown) rice. Some Imagine products and some Good Karma products (the chocolate drink) contain cane sugar, which is a high glycemic sweetener, rather than a rice-based sweetener. There may be some Imagine rice milk products that are canola free, you have to check the labels, and it changes with time. The same canola issues (and cane sugar considerations) also apply to the Imagine frozen desert products. Good Karma makes rice-based frozen deserts that are probably canola free. [Health effects in humans shown to result from, or statistically linked to (different than caused by), erucic acid (_not_ Canola oil) in various medical research papers, review articles, and toxicology textbooks, include decreasing red blood cell count and autism. In animal studies there are many more documented effects of erucic acid including heart lesions and distortions of mitochondria. These studies can easily be found in the medical literature. They do not prove that the amounts of canola oil consumed by people will cause health problems, and the FDA has ruled that oil containing not more than 2% erucic acid is safe for human consumption except for infants.] Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage.

 Great flour for gluten free bread,5,"Set bread maker to 'rapid'. Heat 1 cup milk, then add 3 egg whites and 1 egg. Add 1 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast, 3 tblspns maple syrup and 1/4 cup oil. Mix and put in breadmaker. Add 1 1/2 cups tapioca flour and 1 cup garbanzo flour. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon xantham gum over top then press 'start'. Use a spatula to scrape down sides and bottom of breadmix as it is mixing. Ensure mixture is moist enough to flatten out within 20 seconds (if it stays in a ball shape, it will turn out too dry). This has made THE fluffiest, tastiest homemade bread I have tried (and I've tried LOTS!). Don't use potato flour. Sorghum flour makes it taste yucky. Rice flour takes away the fluffiness. …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful

So, in order to keep my furry friends happy and save some money I purchased weruvia online, and to my my surprise one of them would not eat it at all. I discovered that the food I purchased online unlike the one I was buying at the pet store was made in Thailand.

 not the same GF brownie mix,1,"The first time I made this mix it was outstanding, to the point I doubted it was actually gluten free.

 Tastes JUST like root beer,5,"The only way I can think of not thinking this tastes like root beer is if you like the taste of diet root beer. Put this in either flat or sparking water and you have a zero cal. natural taste treat. I find it takes more than a drop or two to get the flavor for me, but be careful not to over do it too, since stevia will start to taste bitter if there's too much of it used.

 Cancelled my monthly order after trying it.,1,"We are a dairy free family who use coconut milk as a substitute, so I am pretty familiar with coconut milk. I had purchased several cans of Native Forest from a retail store and liked it - I use it in my coffee as a creamer. However, the stuff that was delivered to me through Superstore was completely different that the cans I bought at the store. The milk is very thin (which I don't mind) and incredibly oily. I shook the cans thoroughly before I opened them, but you can see the oily floating at the top. The milk separates when in the fridge with the coconut oil forming a thick layer on top. There is an odd flavor to the milk, too. I am so bummed I have to go through 12 cans of this before I can order some Thai Kitchen. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Miracle Supplement,5,"Magnesium is vitally important on many levels. It not only helps your muscles to relax, but also aids sleep and allows for a more calm & balanced state of mind. Low levels of this mineral make nearly every disease worse, whether you are dealing with asthma, diabetes, depression or cardiovascular disease. It assists in the assimulation of calcium & potassium, so those with osteoporosis concerns should be looking to include Magnesium in their supplements. I have been using Magnesium Calm for the past year and have found it very helpful for relaxing muscle tension, & getting a good nights sleep, not to mention its calming effect on my state of mind ! Its easy to take and comes in several flavors as well. I recommend it to many of my massage clients, so they can decrease the pain and discomfort in their bodies. …",13 out of 16 users found this review helpful

Very rich and bold, not bitter, but packs a nice punch. Reminds me of coffee from an old-fashioned percolator. A good, strong cup of coffee is hard to come by when you are using some of these newer brewing machines, but the Keurig system is definitely the exception and this variety of k-cup is the best we have ever tasted. …",52 out of 55 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",18 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Please avoid!!,1,"Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your dogs. Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients. They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food. This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school. Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness. Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. i would recommend going to [...] and compare brands and see what is right for you budget wise. try something like orijen or evo. …",4 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Bottom line - it worked for  me,5,"On A Diet: The Owner's Manual for Waist Management If you are looking to stay healthy and reduce cholestrol, this product may be just what you need. Best of all, it can be used by those taking cholesterol medications and, if you don't want to use the meds (or can't), this might provide some help. They are tasty and full of plant statins, not medications. I used them as directed but I don't think they'd work if you aren't also watching your diet and getting a minimum level of exercise - but perhaps they would.

 I'm not impressed,3,"I decided to purchase this balsamic after reading a few good reviews. From what I heard from a few people, I expected much more. This is a watery vinegar and does not cling to your food like the better balsamics. I put a couple drops on some cheese and they instantly rolled off onto the plate. It's also much more sour than I expected. The bottle should have a smaller opening as it drips down the side and pours out too quickly. I'd recommend ripping out the plastic piece and dumping it in a cruet. It is smooth as some others have said and does not leave a bad aftertaste. I think I'll save this for cooking and dressing rather than drizzling on food. I imagine it would make a good reduction. It does make a decent vinaigrette as I mixed it with olive oil and had a salad for breakfast this morning. You don't need a lot. It's simply not up to par with better balsamics that work well with eveything. I'm partial to thicker, sweeter balsamics, so take that as you will. If you like thinner, tangier balsamics then this may be for you. I'd consider this more of a recipe ingredient than a condiment. The Superstore price is also on the high side. You can currently get two bottles of this exact product on eBay for $12. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful
