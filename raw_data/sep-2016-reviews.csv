 THE popcorn for movie theater popcorn lovers,5,"I am one of those people who MUST have popcorn when I go to a movie. Many times, its my favorite part of the movie. So, I finally bought a movie style popcorn popper because I didnt like the taste of microwave popcorn. When I first got my popcorn popper, I just went to the grocery store, picked up a bag of popcorn, some of that powered popcorn butter flavoring and some vegetable oil. It did the job but, like microwave popcorn, just didnt replicate the taste of movie theater popcorn. I searched and read tons of reviews on Superstore and finally decided to order this brand. MY GOD! This IS it! With my first batch, I was blown away by the taste. This tastes exactly like the movie theater popcorn. If not better because you KNOW its fresh. First: The 2.5 ounce packet is enough of a serving for a person. I popped 2 of packets the first time and it was the equivalent of one of those huge buckets you'd get at the theater. I had to share. haha. Second: When I received the box of packets, I thought the oil was going to be a liquid. Its actually a solid. I had first thought I received a old batch but no, thats how its supposed to be. Third: Like the packets tell you... let your popper heat for about 5 minutes, then slide the ""solid"" oil contents into the popper as well as the corn/salt mix. All at the same time. It takes about 2-3 minutes before the popping starts but it'll pop up a TON of popcorn. And again, the taste. WOW! This is the popcorn I've been looking for. …",50 out of 50 users found this review helpful
 I'm In A New Hare Club For Men!!!,5,"I'm always looking for a new dinner idea for my family. Just in the last month, I've prepared ostrich burgers, lemming tartare, and feral catserole. But none of those tasty treats prepared me for the magic of Fresh Whole Rabbit! I'll admit to a little hesitation when I first ordered this gastronomic wonder; I mean, what if his little fur coat got damp and the package arrived smelling ripe? Well, the good folks at Cloverdale already considered this problem, and thoughtfully skinned the little guy ahead of time! (Yes, the rabbit was a ""guy"". But I'll leave my ""Rabbit Penis Soup"" recipe for another review...) Anyway, the rabbit comes packed in triple-layered dry ice and charcoal, and wrapped in a festive satin bag. Can you spell CLASSY? (If not, it's right there in the previous sentence.) There were so many preparation options in the enclosed cookbook, so to keep it simple, I chose the simple yet elegant ""Raw Chunks on Toothpicks"" from the ""Rabbitizers"" section. It tasted like sushi, only completely different! We had enough left over for some vodka-infused Rabbitinis (found in the ""Bunny Sippers"" section). I can also attest to the powerful aphrodisiac effect of eating rabbit; not only was the food seductive, but the rabbit's glandular secretions make for a powerful musk that can make any boudoir seem like a vegetable garden! In closing, I will definitely order this exquisite gourmet cuisine again. And here's a fun suggestion: Leftover rabbit carcasses + Fishing line = Extra-Cute mobile for hanging over the crib! …",31 out of 39 users found this review helpful
 Ick. Don't buy ths!!,1,"Was so excited when I saw Zico had 14 oz containers of coconut water. This is not the original formulation. It is disgusting. It is like it has been boiled down into a concentrate and then water added. It tastes terrible & odd and has WAY too much packaging than the original style. Not thirst quenching at all.... makes me nauseous. Buy the brand ""One"". Stay away from this product. Total waste of money. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Way too many peanut butter crackers!!,2,"I added this to my grocery wishlist as an Superstore recommendation which popped up after I had added something else. I really should've taken a minute to look at the product page, or to realize what would happen before it was too late and someone bought this for me: Nearly HALF THE STUFF IN THIS THING HAS PEANUT BUTTER. To which I am deathly allergic. Peanut allergies are fairly common, so why the hell is half of this thing peanut butter crackers? I can see putting 10 packs of peanut butter crackers in here, maybe 12, but TWENTY?! WHY?! Let this be a warning to people with peanut allergies -- AVOID this product. You'll be stuck with a massive pile of **** you can't eat. …",5 out of 27 users found this review helpful
" I like the idea of a new food source, but I choose to let my bunnies free range.",4,"I really like the idea of a food source that isn't chicken, turkey or beef raised in feed lots, but it is much more practical to plant a prize winning garden and wait for some rabbits to move in and eat up your prized plants, and then sneak out and tag a few with lightweight transmitter collars in the middle of the night. That way, you have a wild, free range food source. Your herd will get the best free food possible by going out and eating all of your neighbors flowers. Marigolds really impart something great to the flavor of the meat. Sunflower plants also give them a really nice mild flavor. That way, it cost you nearly nothing (except of course the cost and toil of raising your lovely garden initially) to have a readily available and fresh food source at hand. With the radio collars, you can easily track where your herd is currently foraging. Whether it be down the street on cranky old Mrs. Hagersteins prized flower, or on your hippie neighbors cherished ""Organic and sustainable"" vegan garden. Plus, everyone knows that wild, so called ""nuisance"" pests are the absolute lowest fat, and have the best diet. Good idea though, all the same! I just like my food source to be ""free range"".

 Is this even coffee?,1,"I usually brew a Lg setting cup and the first time I tried Veranda, it tasted like a coffee flavored Chai. Extremely weak coffee. For people who don't enjoy coffee. And of course, WAY over priced. Why is starbux almost 5 dollars more than all the other brands? In this economy? Guess he really needs the cash to fund more illegal settlements. The weakest coffee I've ever had. Horrible. Whats more? Theres a starbax on a corner not far from my house (go figure)...and it's amusing to see the lemmings line up around the building to pay $5 for a cup of coffee, when 3 blocks over is a small mom & pop Cuban grocery (family owned) that makes the best Cuban coffee this side of the everglades, made fresh to order. Not a soul in the parking lot, I jump out ask for a grande con leche with sugar. It's 16Oz. for $1, and not a penny goes to fund any illegal settlements in Palestine. …",3 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Hodgson Mill Barley Bread,5,"I am so totally satisfied by Hodgson Mill products & I probably have purchased > 100 loaves at this point. I used some as a present to my brother with good results, too. Never have I seen ""old"" smelling mix nor have I ever had a yeast failure. Their taste & texture is wonderful. Never have I had a ""slicing failure"" where you can't get a slice to hold together long enough to lay it down. The different types lend themselves well to adding ingredients such as Chopped Nuts or Sesame Seeds or Millet Seed or - - use your own imagination. Coming in nice units of 6 loaves makes pantry storage easy, and once opened, the carton yields 6 boxes with ""Best By"" dates easily accessible on each so rotating your shelf stock is almost ""goof-proofed"". Next time you walk a grocery store, note the prices there! Here again, I think you really can't beat the quality with a really fair price that Hodgson provides. It seems to me that they have expended great effort to have the best product they can produce & the best shipping available for their customers. Buy with great confidence based on my experiences with them during the last 2-3 years. I hope this helps decision making. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Im impressed!,5,"I tried both these and just the plain shirataki noodles with zero calories purchased at my local Asian market and I prefer these the best. The plain Shirataki feel like a noodle shaped gummie candy when you eat them...not as hard but too 'slippery'..The House Brand with tofu didn't have that same 'slippery' taste. I didnt find preperation to be that bothersome as a couple of posters have mentioned. I just open them and pour them in a strainer and let the water run over them throughly, flipping them once or twice to get them rinsed well then I toss them in a pan of boiling water for about 15 seconds (they're already cooked) drain and season them however I wish. They have been a great addition to my low calorie diet. I just tried them last night with a packet of seasoning from a box of Suddenly Salad (classic) and I was in heaven...40 calories for the WHOLE bag! …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 High levels of Arsenic,1,"There are high levels of Arsenic in this formula from the organic brown rice they use. My pediatrician told me to stop using it because it has high levels of arsenic in it which is a poison! This happens because the organic brown rice used to make the formula soaks up the arsenic from the soil when it's growing and then when they use it, it contaminates the milk. I'm not sure how Earths Best will fix this issue but until they fix it, I am not using this formula. …",3 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 India's Original Spiced Milk Tea.,5,"In many languages around the world, ""chai"" simply means ""tea."" In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea. Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region, although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea, rich milk, various spices and a sweetner. The spices most commonly used are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper; Tazo's very peppery Chai adds rooibos, vanilla, star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe. You should always have this tea with real sugar, even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener, because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. And if you like your store-bought Chai, maybe you'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices, too! Namaste ... …",10 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 I like Mor Gold topping much more than this one.,2,"I don't like the after-taste of the ""Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping""..... I prefer ""Mor Gold"" Premium Butter Topping it has a far superior taste and ""Mor Gold"" is also more creamy and more theater like buttery taste than ""Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping"". If you haven't tried Mor Gold - then you really can't say...I've tried them all and Mor Gold taste is just like in the movie theaters...I too use to work in a movie theater and I know that butter popcorn taste like the back of my hand, I love it and Mor Gold has it hands down.... Also if you can find the Coconut oil in the 1/4 lb. sticks, this also helps make it more like the movies But it's not really necessary, Mor Gold will do the job well all by itself....The salt is really just up to you....I tried the ""fine grain popcorn salt"" but I think regular house salt from your pantry is just as good or even better...Try It & Enjoy! …",21 out of 25 users found this review helpful

I have not been to the doctor yet to see if this working. The product arrived promptly. I drink two cups per day sweetened with a little stevia.

" BEST OIL FOR BAKING, FRYING, SKIN SOFTENER, OR RIGHT OUT OF THE JAR",5,"After menopause, I developed high total cholesterol. Fortunately, only the ""lousy"" cholesterol (LDH) increased, with my ""happy"" number (HDL) staying at an impressive 90. Instead of taking the recommended ""liptor, et al"", and as a registered nurse who knows the awful side effects of such drugs, I opted to research all things diet related. After my studies, I have decided that our government and medical community has been either ignorant, at best, or complicit, at worst, in the great soybean growers maligning of the health benefits of this oil. There are a few good scientific books available through Superstore. I'm not due for another lipid test for at least a year. I will post an update here, good or bad outcome. Whole Foods stopped carrying this brand. I tried their new 365 brand and had to spit it out --- TOTAL PLASTIC TASTE AND SMELL. This product is in a non-leaching plastic container and is incredibly pleasant tasting raw (only do that after eating anything sweetened with sugar or honey to prevent cavities), but unbelievably delicious in cooking. Last week I was in an interview and the lady turned and smiled stating she detected a ""slight, delightful hint of just-baked cookies"" coming from my direction. HAD TO BE THIS OIL I always pop a little in my mouth before going out!!!!! Watch the medical statistics that will be coming out of the country of Jamaica in the next two to three years.

 Best Oatmeal EVER!,5,"I won't even delve into the fact that this oatmeal is gluten free, because it doesn't matter. This is by far the best instant oatmeal I've ever tasted, and I've tasted them all. Take it from this died-in-the-wool oatmeal addict, you don't want your cupboard to be bare of this product. Forget the dried out packets that lurk in your grocery aisle, because they not only look but taste like cardboard. These oats have a higher moisture content already, and so they are naturally more plump in the bowl, and their taste is more consistent with long-cook-time oatmeal than any of their other counterparts. The added ingredients really are only the finest, and the taste proves it - raisins are yummy when plucked directly from the packet! I don't care for cooked bananas, but the banana oatmeal is just as delicious as my favorite maple flavor. The price is reasonable for this organic, gluten-free product. The taste is without parallel. This is a product I can recommend at the highest level without a single doubt or qualification!Glutenfreeda's Instant Oatmeal, Variety Pack Instant Oatmeal, 6-Oatmeal Packets (Pack of 8) …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 Ritz crackers made in China!!!!!!,1,"Where to start~~ First of all I would like to say I have always loved Ritz crackers. Secondly I believe I'm at fault by not reading the reviews before I purchased this product. With a one and one half star out of five, I should've spent time in reading the reviews and why it didn't have a better rating. No one as of yet has mentioned the fact that it's not the same Ritz cracker that you would buy in the grocery store, at least to my knowledge. This product is clearly marked ""made in China"". There is no information on the website I could find that said this was an imported item. Thirdly, as other reviewers have mentioned, a lot of the product (package crackers) are broken as the other reviewers have mentioned. Last but not least-the taste. To me, who've been eating Ritz crackers ever since they came out, the taste is totally different than a partial box of Ritz crackers I had in my cupboard. The only way I can describe this is more of a wheat like taste very unlike the original American made Ritz cracker. I have to say though, that Superstore customer service was very good about this and refunded me the money I spent as I am a person who believes in buying as much American-made product as I can. I am not a complainer and most of the items I've received from Superstore's gourmet foods have been packaged well and are as described on Superstore 's website accurately. If you are Chinese, please do not take offense to this as most of the electronic items in my home (name brand items like Samsung etc.) are made in China or another country outside of the United States. When it comes to food however, I prefer to stick to America-made products exclusively-does that make me a bad person?. I never thought at my age ( almost 70 years old and disabled) that I would be spending time writing reviews although I'm aware that most Americans would like to know where their food is made. That's about it and good luck shopping. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Wonderful for Acne! (shocking I know),5,"I am plagued with adult acne and I have tried most of the stuff out there with little luck so decided to start from the inside out! I took some info various books along with a few other sources and have had success. I began ingesting the following(see below) and by week 3 of this new intake my skin looked amazing! really amazing, glowing I would dare say! Acne is a bummer and is emotional and as a woman I know how awful it really can be! I slowly built up my intake of the following and now consume each thing on this list each day and I swear to you my skin is 95% clear!! 1) vitamins: Pantothenic acid, alpha liopic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, acidophilus. 2) I ingest tablespoon of organic fish oil (liquid) and flaxseed oil 3) I ingest 1 tablespoon of pure organic cocao powder(not coco powder w/ sugar..the real deal like this BRAND)I use in a shake w/ a banana since this stuff can be very bitter. 4) 4 cups of organic green tea 5) 1 glass of blueberry juice 6) topically I use BP each night on my skin and use not a moisturizer but a hydration cream and I cleanse with an over the counter sensitive cleansing liquid. 7) for scaring I use topical vitamin c serum each morning I decided on this mix based on several different resources and this combo works wonders for me. I am not sure if one thing is more powerful than another to be honest but I can say that 3 months into this ""test"" my skin is still looking amazing.

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Contains maltitol,2,"Initially I liked this product very much. I like the taste and texture, and the three shipments I've received have all been fresh. I have not had any problems with ""stale"" or ""chalky"" shipments as described by some other reviewers. However, I became suspicious of whether it is really ""low glycemic"" as claimed, because it tastes sweeter than one would expect for a sugar-free low-carb product. Looking more closely at the ingredients, I noticed that it contains maltitol, which is a ""sugar alcohol."" The maltitol in the product contributes 11 grams of carbs to each bar (for a total of 24 grams of carbs). I've read that if you're on a low-carb diet, maltitol should probably be avoided, because it is a carb, and it does have an effect on blood sugar. Also, maltitol can cause intestinal discomfort and/or diarrhea, if you're sensitive to it, or eat too much of it. I have switched to Greens+ High Protein bars (peanut butter flavor), which are fairly low glycemic for this type of product but do not have artificials sweeteners or maltitol. (And no, I do not work for Greens+). Disclaimer: I'm not a nutritionist. You can google maltitol if you want to find out more. …",12 out of 15 users found this review helpful
" fine tea, unacceptable packaging (*updated)",5,"Matcha is purported to have elevated antioxidant and cognitive benefits above standard green teas and was the reason for the purchase. The price is also correspondingly higher, and this brand was the least expensive with the most favorable reviews available on Superstore. This product was my introduction to matcha, and I was pleasantly surprised. It seems a more potent version of your typical, off-the-shelf green tea in just about every way. As a regular tea drinker, I can definitely see this becoming a frequent addition to the different teas I consume on a regular basis. The reason for the deduction of two stars was the packaging. The small box the tea is shipped in is small and relatively flimsy, but is sealed, which is not a big deal. However, as another reviewer testified, the plastic bag inside that actually contains the ground tea was not only partially unsealed, but I would estimate maybe a half tablespoon of powder escaped the bag's 'seal.' This is absolutely unacceptable. I don't care if you're shipping sand; any powder, let alone tea, let alone a finer grade of tea, needs to be completely sealed with an extraordinarily-high level of confidence that the bag is secure. I fail to believe this cannot be achieved within the boundaries of both successfully cost-effective and green packaging. As a broke university student trying to maximize dietary healthfulness on a restricted budget, I'd very much like to include matcha in my regular tea consumption, but I'm not sure I'll order again from this outfit. The unprofessional feel I experienced from this product was not insignificant. *****UPDATE - 10/13/11*****: I since reordered this product, and I was indeed surprised to find that any packaging concerns have been completely resolved. As in the pictures listed on the product page, the flimsy plastic the tea came in previously has been replaced by a thick, folded, brown bag placed inside a very solid tin - which I'm sure I'll reuse. The tea itself is fantastic and now it comes with killer packaging. Zero complaints about this product now; 5 big stars. …",20 out of 22 users found this review helpful
" "" S M O K E D......S A L M O N "".....I S.....N O T.....A L W A Y S....."" L O X '.",3,"Many people, trying to be and sound more sophisticated, substitute the words ""smoked salmon"" for the word ""lox"". Having eaten the ""SEA BEAR SMOKED SALMON TRIO"", herein being reviewed, (and the literature that comes with it), I have learnt that, whilst all ""lox"" IS smoked salmon, not all ""smoked salmon"" is lox. (SeaBear DOES offer a nice, large package of ""lox""....and calls it ""lox"", and illustrates it, in the advertising flyer that comes with the ""Smoked Salmon Trio""). But the fish within the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"" is NOT ""lox"". The fish here is dryish, and very salty. ""Lox"", on the other hand, must go through additional preparation, for it is far more moist than the dryish fish within the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"". I have seen, (in the ""Cabelas"" catalogue), ""Lox"" described as 'buttery'....which it truly is. For those who are interested, ""Lox"" also is usually certified kosher -- whilst the fish within the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"" is not. The smoked salmon within the ""Smoked Salmon Trio"", is, as I have said, very dry and salty. However, all bones have been removed, (although the skin remains). This fish also will keep on a shelf! It need NOT be refrigerated until opened. The three types of smoked salmon within have very little taste variation to me. Yes, there is a TINY bit of difference....but not enough to excite my taste buds. And salmon -- right from cans, especially the top brands and varieties -- right from the supermarket or on Superstore, taste almost the same to me, at a far lesser price. The literature that comes with this set of three smoked salmon varieties is interesting and informative, as is the history of ""SeaBear"" foods, which is also given. This company obviously takes great pride in providing good salmon and other products to its customers, and strives to be the best it can be. I would advise them, however, to emphasize, even more, the difference between ""smoked salmon"" and ""lox"" in ALL its literature, and in the package description of ALL its products. Knowing whether ""Dry"" smoked salmon, or ""buttery"", or ""lox""-type smoked salmon, is in a package, would be a great help to those who, like me, sometimes get their syntax and meanings confused, betwixt the two. SUMMARY: Will NOT Buy This Product Again. (But hopefully, the ""Lox"" they sell will be available in smaller quantities! : ), …",10 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 don't buy for travels,3,"I really wanted these to work for travels where I pack all my own food. However, they are a decidedly poor alternative for travels, since most of the outer coating of the fruit turns into very messy powder. The strawberry flavor is slightly less of an ordeal in that regards but still messy. They are probably good for you if you want a stowaway fruit you can use when you haven't gotten to the store for awhile or want it out of season to sprinkle into something, but otherwise the price and messiness are both much too prohibitive.

 Pretty nice,4,"The product consists of an approximately 10 inch (25 cm) long piece of meat with 1 or 2 smaller (approx 1 1/2-2 inches, 3-5 cm) pieces thrown in. The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package. Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt). It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather. I appreciate the fact that the pepper bits are not ""loose"" like some other jerkies, so crumbs are not much of a concern. Per the box, store in a cool, dry place.

 My Vegetarian Dogs.,5,"Being that I am a vegetarian I was having a hard time feeding my dogs Blue Buffalo Chicken kibble. I just could not do it anymore from a moral and ethical standpoint so I started to research 'Vegetarian Dogs' like crazy. Came to find out most dogs who convert to a vegetarian diet thrive on it and I can honestly say this is true. My dogs are ages 2ish,7 and 11ish, all adopted, all Chihuahuas and all came with their own issues. The one thing we all agree on is that Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula is the best. My oldest dog has seriously just thrived off this food, she is so energetic and happy. My other 2 love it and their coats look so shiny and their nasty dog breath has gone away. I know my decision was one that many people will criticize and say is 'selfish' and 'wrong' but the bottom line is I did my research, spoke with the people at Natural Balance, told my vet and in the process found out that the worlds oldest living dog was/is 26 and is a vegetarian. So needless to say, I don't think dogs not eating meat is as big of a deal as we would like to think it is. This dog food has changed my life, my dogs lives and the lives of many other vegans I have met who were against getting a dog because they could not find an ethical dog food.

 Mild sweet tea,5,I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose. Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth. I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.

" Tastes good, but there's bugs in mine!",2,"This is my first ever product review. I did not purchase this product from Superstore, but my local Whole Foods market just a couple days ago. Normally I'm not one to do reviews, but since this product is so expensive, I wanted to share my experience. I've been working really hard recently to cut my sugar intake. After reading rave reviews on Superstore about Sweet Tree Coconut Palm sugar, and doing a little research, I debated for 2 weeks, and then decided to just go get some even though it was $5 for a pound. (my health is more important) I started out by using some in my steel cut oats yesterday, which I really liked! I also used it in my coffee yesterday in place of regular sugar, but I noticed little dark things floated to the top. I know it's pretty raw, so I figured, maybe they were little fibers from the tree, or perhaps it was something with that batch of coffee? So I just scooped the little dark floaters out, and drank my coffee. Which tasted pretty good with the palm sugar! I was so pleased, that I was very excited to have my coffee this morning with my new found sweetener. This morning (not more than 10 minutes ago) I made some coffee again with my palm sugar, and before I even had a chance to drink it... more little floaters! As I pushed them to the sides of my white cup, one I noticed for sure had LEGS on it! Yes, my friends... it was a BUG!! I dumped my coffee imediately, and made some more with(unfortunately) my raw organic sugar that I still have. No floaters. So it's definitely not in the coffee... it's in the palm sugar! Has anyone else had an experience/noticed this? I know it's supposed to be healthier and all... but for $5 I'd like my sugar to not have little bugs in it. That's NOT the extra minerals I had in mind! Maybe I just got a bad bag? It's not my intention to bad mouth this company -- but I would want someone to tell me if they knew I was eating/drinking little bugs. I haven't contacted the company just yet, as I just noticed it for sure this morning. I also looked in the bag that I have, and can see others... one is caked in sugar crystals, so they're hard to notice unless you really look for them. …",26 out of 31 users found this review helpful

 Price went up 20% with the new packaging and there is less Cinnamon,1,"Barbara's Bakery hyped the new packaging but neglected to mention that the weight went from 12oz per box to 10 oz per box. I use to purchase a 4 pack of the 12 oz old package for 15.57 and that works out to 32.4 cents per oz. the new price for a 6 pack of the 10 oz box works out to 39 cents per ounce. That's a 20% price hike in a period of low to no inflation. Thanks for the nice new package guys. I much prefer the old package at the old price and will be checking out other cereals with the intent of eliminating cinnamon puffins from my diet. The cereal also tastes different - not as good. I looked at the ingredients and noticed that in both the old and new product there is 150 mg of salt. However, in the old ingredient list cinnamon came before salt. In the new ingredient list it comes after salt. Thus, there is less cinnamon in the new cereal. You can really taste the difference. The old recipe was much tastier. Again, my hat is off to Barbara's Bakery. The price went up and the taste is not nearly as good. Great job guys. January 20, 2011 Update: I have replaced cinnamon puffins with other cereals. Bring back the old taste which I loved so much and I'll buy again, even at the increased price. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 RATHER HAVE THE SALT THAN THE SUGAR .,2,"I thought this item would be a good addition to try on the diet I've been following. I was looking for a low sodium, vegetable flavor. The brand I usually use DOES make a vegetable flavor, but not in the low sodium variety. I have not opened the package of Frontier as yet. I was not happy after reading the label. The first ingredient listed on the label is, ""Corn Syrup Solids."" There is a carbohydrate content, a sugar content and a relatively high calorie content, comparatively speaking. My usual brand has about 10 calories per serving. Frontier's has a calorie content of 60 per serving. Frontier website states, ""Frontier Natural Products Co-op specializes in natural and organic products."" I did not expect to get sugar in their soup product, albeit a less sweeter one. Lower dextrose, nevertheless is still sugar. If you look on their website, this is what Frontier states about the product: "" Vegetable Flavored Broth Powder, Low Sodium - Use this rich flavor blend of tomato, onion, garlic, carrot, basil, celery seed, kelp, parsley, spinach, turmeric and bay for soups, rice and pasta.

" Not bad, but decidedly unlike any other K-Cup product",3,"Full disclosure - I worked briefly for the people who make this product back in the late '70s. Since I had a personal connection to the product, I really wanted to like it. And it's not bad - it's OK, but it's just a bit odd. First off, the packaging. These aren't your father's K-Cup, where it's an actual cup. These have a top like the traditional cup (so they'll fit in the brewer) but the bottom is completely different. It's almost more like a filter than a cup, and kinda rounded rather than cup-shaped. They come in sealed plastic bags of twelve, so you need to keep them in a ziplock bag or some kind of airtight container once you open the bag, unless you're planning on using them all right away. Second, the flavor. It's OK, not bad at all, but it just tastes a little off for some reason. A hint of odd flavor. Also, it seems to lack body, for want of a better term. It doesn't have that rich, full, satisfying flavor I expect from a good cup of French Roast. Lastly, it seems to leave more sediment in the bottom of the cup than traditional K-Cups - not sure if that's a by-product of the design or what. Bottom line - it's not like I'm going to throw them away. I'll keep them and drink them, but I probably won't buy them again. I much prefer the flavor of just about any regular K-Cup to these, even non-premium brands like Folger's. UPDATE: After drinking my way through the whole case and comparing them with other K-Cup products, I have a bit more appreciation for these and might consider buying them again, particularly given the excellent price of around 38 cents a cup if you use Subscribe and Save. One other point I neglected to mention in my original review is that these seem to produce more ""crema"" - the brownish foam that appears on top of a good cup of coffee - than most K-Cup products. Keep an eye out for my reviews of the Rainforest Blend (which I found somewhat weak and flavorless) and Fog Chaser (which just arrived and I've yet to sample) varieties coming soon. …",54 out of 63 users found this review helpful

What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them.

 Cats LOVE this Dry Food.  Best Commercial Product List I've Found that in Reasonably Priced Commercial Pet Food. RECOMMENDED.,5,"I have 4 cats ranging in age from 2-10 years old. We previously fed them Iams Multi-Cat dry food which we purchased in 20lb bags at our local warehouse store. About 4 months ago, the warehouse store discontinued stocking Iams cat food, so I went looking for another, better quality dry cat food that was reasonably priced (my preference was to make my own cat food, but the reality is that I don't have time to do so). I stumbled on Castor & Pollux on Superstore & decided to give the blue bag (adult feline) a try. We've now gone through 27lbs of the adult feline dry food and like the Castor & Pollux dry food enough to make this our cat food of choice (so I have to remember to order ahead of time to not run out). We are now trying the green bag (indoor cat), so that review will come later after we go through a bag or 2 (15lb bags). Since it is not listed, and I wanted to know this information before I purchased, here is a full List of ingredients straight from the back of the blue bag: Chicken, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal, Menhaden Fish Meal, Ground Whole Grain Barley, Oat Groats, Brewers Rice, Chicken Fat preserved with Mixed Tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), Salmon Meal, Dried Egg Product, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dried Potatoes, Cultured Whey, Dried Carrots, Dried Bananas, Dried Apples, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ground Flaxseed, Sodium Bisulfate, Potassium Choloride, Salt, Dried, Blueberries, Dried Papya, Choline Chloride, Taurine, DL-Methionine, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (source of Vitamin C), Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, Copper Sulfate, Niacin, Vitamin A Supplement, Calcium Pantothenate, Manganous Oxide, Thiamine Mononitrate (source of Vitamin B1), Riboflavin Supplement (source of Vitamin B2), Pyridoxine Hydroxcholoride (source of Vitamin B6), Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Vitamin K1 Supplement, Sodium Selenite, Folic Acid, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Cobalt Caronate, Yeast Culture (Saccharomyes Cerevisiae), Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophuilus Fermentation Product, Dried Aspergillus Niger Fermentation Extract, Dried Trichoderma Longbrachiatum Fermentation Extract, Dried Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Extract and Fermentation Solubles. My older cats (8 & 10 yrs) had a hard transition from the Iams. We cleaned up a lot of carrot-filled cat vomit for the first 2 weeks. The younger cats transitioned with no issues whatsoever. We have since gone to the indoor feline and are not experiencing the daily upchucking (whether this is because they are already accustomed to the food or not, I don't know, but would assume that it plays a part). All cats love the food. We did find that they eat a little less of the Castor & Pollux, so maybe they are getting more quality with each bite. Iams uses by-product and Cator & Pollux uses meal, so I assume this may be the case. I did research on by-product vs meal & found the following information from various websites: Protein, in the form of quality meat ingredients, is the most important component of a pet's diet. As animals with a carnivorous background, their digestive tract is designed to utilize primarily meat and fat. It is also the most expensive ingredient for a manufacturer to buy and the profit margin on a product is drastically affected by the amount and quality used. Ideally, the first ingredient of a food should be either a specified meat meal, or a specified fresh meat type followed by a meal. Meat sources in ""meal"" form (as long as they are from a specified type of animal, such as chicken meal, lamb meal, salmon meal etc.) are not inferior to whole, fresh meats. ""Meal"" consists of meat and skin, with or without the bones, but exclusive of feathers/hair, heads, feet, horns, entrails etc. and have the proper calcium/phosphorus ratio required for a balanced diet. They have had most of the moisture removed, but remember that meats in their original, ""wet"" form still contain up to 75% water. Byproducts of any type are less desirable and only acceptable if they do not make up the main source of animal protein and if the name of the species used is also defined in some manner (e.g. ""chicken byproducts"" or ""beef byproducts"" but not ""meat byproducts"" or ""poultry byproducts""). Byproducts consist of anything but the quality cuts of meat. Castor & Pollux has a Pet & Soul Foundation that supports various pet organizations & charities. Look on their website & do the daily free kibble game to donate free kibble to pet shelters. All in all, I think that I could probably come up with a better homemade cat food, but, given time constraints and solid know-how, I think that this Caster & Pollux dry food is a good choice. My cats, all indoors, love the food, their fur is shiny & their skin appears to be healthy. We do not have dander issues & all the cats seem to be feisty & healthy. This is a reasonably priced dry food with a good list of ingredients as compared to other commercial foods. Castor & Pollux claim that they fully & unconditionally guarantee their food, so if you order & don't like it, you can call them. Best of all, Superstore ships it to my doorstep. RECOMMENDED. 10/3/11 (EDIT): I am still feeding my cats this food & they are doing well. I now supplement with a little wet cat food (have tried many brands/varieties & a still trying to find a ""hit"") daily, but the majority of their diet is this Castor & Pollux kibble. …",63 out of 64 users found this review helpful

 Poisoned Product,1,"Two or three months ago, I subscribed to this company for automatic delivery of their dried chicken ""breasts"" each month. When this month's order arrived, I allowed my Golden Retriever to eat one only. Within a short time he became severely ill and continued vomiting repeatedly throughout the entire night. I am a retired attorney/judge. I do not become hysterical over every complaint that makes a claim that some product or other can kill your pet. Now, I greatly regret my cavalier attitude about this particular item. Had my Golden been weakened in any other way, I do not believe he would have survived this incident. My on-going purchase of this product despite prior bad press and numerous complaints was foolish. But I trusted that the distributors of the dried chicken ""breasts"" would monitor this product more closely after the first recall of this product so that no other animals would be harmed. Such was clearly not the case. In fact, it appears that the only action the U.S. distributors took after the last recall was to print on each package that the product had come from the United States. Closer inspection however reveals that although this product was packaged in the U.S., it continued to be imported from China. Superstore is by far the best retailer on the Internet by far. My complaint is not against Superstore. But I feel compelled to alert other potential customers regarding the poisoning my dog suffered (and he did suffer). I can imagine other pets who are smaller, older, or in some other way more vulnerable than my Golden, would and could actually die if they consumed even the smallest amount of this product. It's true that this was not the case every month. Rather it is an intermittent but on-going problem. I cannot emphasize enough how serious this problem is. It is absolutely necessary to eliminate the distribution of this product in the U.S. once and for all.

" Curbs Appetite, But the Rest Is Unclear",3,"I purchased NEURO TRIM on a whim. Lately I've been interested in trying different energy drinks, supplement drinks, beverages that claim to aid in weight loss, etc. I was intrigued by the bottle's shape, the purple color of the container, and the unique cap. Per the instructions on the bottle, I didn't consume the beverage until about an hour before dinner. I had been rather hungry that day, so I was surprised that by the time dinner actually arrived, I didn't feel as hungry as I had earlier. Other than a slight sweet taste, the drink was rather tasteless. The closest thing the flavor reminds me of is a weak mixture of Kool-Aid. The packaging says that NEURO TRIM helps with ""healthy weight loss, better digestive health, promotes healthy aging, and helps curb appetite."" The drink does help with curbing appetite. However, I'm not sure if it has much impact on healthy weight loss. According to the directions, in order for that to happen, a person is supposed to drink a bottle of NEURO TRIM three times a day before each major meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). It might work because by the time you pay for all the NEURO TRIM you're supposed to be drinking, there won't be any money left over to buy any actual food. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful

I also had an issue with lens kit, also on the page of the Canon camera I purchased. The lens' didn't fit the Canon Rebel t2i I had purchased. Word to the wise, check before your purchase. Also, I admit I have no way to telling if this is a good product or not. Love the nespresso machine we bought. …",1 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 This is not JUST erythritol!,5,"Some folks are complaining that it's too expensive for JUST erythritol. But this is organic erythritol fermented from cane sugar. The Emerald Forest brand mentioned elsewhere in these reviews is not organic and certainly therefore derived from corn, which is cheaper. What's the big deal, you ask? Well, I clicked on the Emerald Forest brand 44 lb. bag, and it's manufactured by Cargill--the big pharmaceutical and agri-business giant. The corn they use is most likely genetically engineered.

 Is It Possible To Get Excited Over Spam?,5,With Bacon Spam the answer is yes. As far as I'm concerned they can simply discontinue all over spam varities. Bacon spam has a much more meaty and slightly smokey flavor that brings Spam up several notches in my opinion. You can of course use it in any way you normally use regular spam but perhaps one of my favorite ways to have it is to cube it up and cook it in with navy beans or in split pea soup. I am not a fan of the hot spam or the hickory spam that tastes a bit odd to me. If I were to describe the flavor for you it would be. Bacon spam doesn't taste exactly like bacon. It is more like they mixed 20% bacon in with regular spam. It is hard to find this variety in stores. I have only seen it a the Mega-Walmarts and here on Superstore.

 Techno-BEST,5,"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek. There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine. The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup. This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion. It's easy to hold and get out of the machine. The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier. This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut. Ingenious.

" Great for IBS, IBD and crohns disease- does NOT contain carageean or guar gum which can inflame intestines",5,"After suffering from IBD - inflammatory bowel disease for a number if years, I discovered( to my horror ) that the synthetic ingredient Carrageean and guar gum were a major reason why i had this disorder. Carrageean and guar gum are known carcinogens and contribute to inflammatory conditions in the intestines. Read the report in Cornucopia.org. Since eliminating all foods that contained these ingredients, specifically, carrageean, my small intestine and colon have begun to heal. For years, my doctors thought my inflammation was allergy related or wheat or gluten related - I now suspect it was the synthetic carageean ingredient. Google the dangers of Carrageean and you will understand how it inflames your colon and contributes to IBD, IBS, Crohns, UC and colon cancer. the horrible ingredient is also in some milk and dairy products and pet food. PLEASE READ all labels before buying products. Anyway, This coconut milk is a bit more challenging to use, yes, BUT it tastes great and you know only coconut is the ingredient so it won't inflame your gut which is more than I can say about the other coconut milks I've researched - most contain that horrible carrageean ingredient I now stay away from.

 Veterinary approved...,5,"As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets. I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling. Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those ""duh"" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent. Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least. My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of ""treat."" It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it ""makes pills a treat to give!"" The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger ""capsule"" dog Pill Pockets. The cons: One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!

 Absolutely loving this!!,5,"I've always been a loyal ZICO coconut water fan, and so was extremely excited to hear about the new packaging...and I have to say that I was MORE than pleased! The new blend that they use reminds me more of the Thai coconuts I grew up drinking and the bottles make it so convenient for me to carry around with me since I'm always on the go. The concentrate does not bother me at all, as after doing some research online, my negative opinion of the term has completely been changed. It doesn't mean that it's not natural or that anything is added - it simply means that they have taken the water out and shipped over just the goodness (which by the way, is WAY more environmentally friendly than shipping water across the world!!) and added back the water through reverse osmosis. Hey, if you're a POM or Sambazon fan - then you know that they are from concentrate too! The flavors are super yummy too! I'm in love with the Pomberry. Another thumbs up about the bottle? It's 100% recyclable!! YUP! 100% - including the cap! There aren't too many products out there where you can recylce the cap. Also, it's made from number 2 plastic which means that it's made from recylced materials. I used to find it hard to recylce the carton packaging, as not many facilities knew how to recycle it since it's made from so many different materials.

 Find out what your baby likes. The subscription price is fair,5,"The Vegetable Variety Pack provides an opportunity to find out what your baby likes. We have twin 7-month olds and their favorite is the sweet potato followed by the carrot jars. They love those. They like the winter squash. We could not get either of them to eat the peas with brown rice despite numerous attempts. They like the brown rice cereal we give them though, which we get from the same brand, Earth's Best. They really dislike the peas and will not eat that one. You can get this variety pack at the subscription price, which when considering free shipping is fair enough. You can also get any of these flavor types individually in packs of 12 for the same price and with the same subscription arrangement. You can even get lentils with brown rice under the same terms, so scroll and see all the types of jars they have.

" STOP, Read this review before consuming this product",1,"Ask a Chinese friend about ""forbidden rice"" (&#31105;&#31859;), unless they are history buff like myself, they will give you a puzzled look. The term refers to an obscure trade policy during Manchurian dynasty, not an exotic rice. I will not going to bore you with history here. The story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in America, like the legion of fortune cookies. Most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near Atlanta. We trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat. ""Forbidden rice?"" There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean. The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture. The color does not come off easily. You can get them from Chinese grocery store. What is sold as ""forbidden rice"" at Superstore and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color. It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished. Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off. And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail. When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent. If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye. There is nothing wrong with using food coloring. But is the ink FDA approved? We do not know.

With all the mixed reviews on these new sweeteners and their possible side effects, I have made a conscious decision to avoid them. I am extremely disappointed that no where in the description does it mention that is is sweetened with Stevia. The product description for the Sweet Lemon tea in fact says ""the perfect balance of fresh squeezed lemon, fresh brewed black tea and all natural sugar.""

 Lost a loyal customer- changed formula without notifying customers,1,My dogs had been eating canidae since they stopped eating their puppy food. They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl. This was the only variant in their diet. I returned the bag back to the pet store and found out they had changed their formula because ingredients had become more expensive. They did not even notify consumers!

 My loud mouth cat loves it.,5,"My Cat is coming up on his 13th year and suddenly when we are home he never stops yowling. There is nothing wrong with him medically, he just began demanding an insane amount of attention (he already gets more attention than most children) and begs for food even when he is not hungry because he wants you to come in the kitchen and pay attention to him. So as much as I love incessant meowing while I am trying to read, type, talk or think..... Anywho we didn't want to reward the yowling with treats or feeding him at times other than his normal meals but ignoring the behavior as per the vet and other people instructed simply did not work. After months of his crying we chalked it up to old age and wound up just giving him treats and snacks of his wet food so we could have a phone conversation without the person on the other line thinking we were killing our animal. He mostly ignored the extra food and would gobble up the treats but we knew it wasn't a perma fix. So we tried the cat milk. He loves it. Laps it up like me at a $2 martini happy hour. It appears to have a soothing effect on him because he stops meowing for a while after he gets it. Plus we feed him premium food and he was still a little flaky. (I think due to the dry heat in our home) The cat milk seems to help with the flakiness and his coat seems smoother. I would definitely limit it to a small serving once a day, I gave him a leetle too much when I first got it and I paid for it the next day when I was scooping the box. Other than the one incident it actually seems to help his poop. cheers! …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

" Delicious to eat, great for skin!",5,"I eat about 3 tablespoons of VCO per day. I have used Garden of Life and Spectrum Brands, both of which were the UNREFINED versions. Those brands were delicious and Bronners Fresh Pressed Virgin Whole Kernel is no exception. I prefer unrefined, flavorful coconut oil and this is exactly what I got. I eat it straight from the bottle and it does not make me gag at all. I love it! Not only is it delicious with a taste of toasted coconut, it really smoothes the skin out. I think that I will start cleansing my face with this rather than soap, I have read that people do this. I will try that and write an update. BTW, Bronners sells two version of their VCO, this Whole Kernel Unrefined and the Bronner's Fresh-pressed Virgin Coconut Oil White Kernel Unrefined 14 Fl Oz . According to Bruce Fife, an expert on Coconut and Coconut oil, The difference between the ""white kernel"" and ""Whole kernel"" is that the whole kernel includes the brown membrane that separates the kernel from the shell. According to Fife, this membrane has a higher content of unsaturated fatty acids. According to the manufacturer's website, ""Whole kernel oil, which is made from the kernel with its ""parings"" is more nutritious and has a slightly nuttier flavor whereas white kernel oil offers a choice to consumers who are familiar with this grade. Both grades are versatile and healthy along with being organic and fair trade."" UPDATE: I missed this the first time. Bronners' VCO is made from dried coconut as is Spectrum. Whereas Garden of Life VCO is is made from freshly picked coconuts that are used within 24-48 hrs, the coconut meat shredded (not dried) & cold-pressed using the water from inside the coconut, then fermented to extract the oil.

 Banana bread brownie?,5,"Wow, I just had my first Larabar today after a long run, and I have been blown away. As of late my preference has been for protein bars, but I had picked up a Larabar a few months ago just because it looked interesting. I tried the ""banana cookie dough"" flavor, since I'm a banana nut. Unwrapping the package was difficult, though I've since found out that they have a multi-layer wrapper because there are no preservatives. Once open, I was confronted with a raw looking rectangle of brown with pale chunks in it. It looked moist and smelled phenomenal. The first bite made me think ""banana bread"", and as I ate the rest of the bar I decided it wasn't quite like banana bread, but closer to that than a ""cookie"", in any case. The pale chunks were the #1 ingredient - almonds. The #2 and #3 ingredients were dates and bananas, respectively. The #4 ingredient was.... nothing. There are only 3 ingredients. I actually flipped the wrapper over to see the continuation of the ingredients list before I realized that there was no more list! These bars are a little expensive for a non-protein energy bar, but the taste is like nothing you would expect from a brown rectangular smashed together food thing.

 It works!,5,"This is my second child, and I didn't produce well for the first one, so I'd pretty much resigned myself to minimal milk production and the theory that anything was better than nothing.

Frustrated but unwilling to wean my baby at only 2 months old, I started taking this tea in the hope that it would at least sustain my current level of production. Because it's a little on the expensive side (I was buying it locally at the full retail price) I only drank 3 cups a day. (It recommends 3-5.) A week later, with my cold only just starting to clear up, I was taking home almost 12 ounces of milk. Another week and a half later, I'm catching another cold (the downside of having 2 kids in daycare...) but I'm taking home a solid 14-15 ounces of milk every day. This tea is the ONLY THING I have done differently -- no other supplements or dietary changes, no changes in feeding or pumping schedules -- so I know for sure it's the tea that's doing it!

I rated it a ""3"" only because I couldn't submit the review without a rating. …",4 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Splenda has not yet been duplicated here,3,"Sweetleaf is expensive and weird. So Splenda is the best, way overpriced product so far. The others are not the same in terms of taste or the overall exorbitant cost for all of these products. I also use some cactus juice. If one could travel to Mexico without being beheaded, I'd pick up a lot of cactus items for sweetening, itching, different diseases -- it's a dollar for a quart. Here, we pay a fortune, Also, my wife is part Quechua -- the original settlors of North and South America, so I tire somewhat at the 'American Indian' casino stuff -- so the old Andean medicine works better than our idiocies. Look on the Web. I am second-generation diabetic -- 6 ft., 150 lbs. I know sugar replacements. Splenda does add real sugar for baking; avoid it. …",3 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Not the best brand of this producct,3,"This product has a nasty aftertaste because it is sweetened with aspertame, not sugar. It is overly sweet and has little apple flavour. Buy a different brand unless you especially like an artificial sweetener. Had I known about the aspertame, I would not have bought this brand. …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Amonium Bicarbonate: Read ingred. list.....,1,"Please investigate the ingredient list of the so called ""healthy"" alternatives. Especially if your body is already sensitive to gluten, MSG, wheat, or other things. Here is only one review of one of the ingredients in these crackers.... ------------------------------------------------------ AMMONIUM BICARBONATE Ammonia powder is ammonium bicarbonate, a leavening agent that is a precursor of today's baking powder and baking soda; it must be ground to a powder before using. It is also known as hartshorn, carbonate of ammonia or powdered baking ammonia. It is still called for in some recipes especially for cookies. It is suggested substituting an equal amount of double acting baking powder for the powdered ammonia (hartshorn) in a recipe. (Your kitchen would stink of ammonia while the cookies baked, but the cookies would not taste or smell of ammonia --------------------------------------------------------- Now doesn't that just make you want to gobble up these crackers,..NOT. Most of the product comes from China....another caution. It is preferred by some food processors because it is CHEAP....so how expensive is common baking soda &bakin g powder? …",7 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Don't get ripped off,1,"I've seen these products at high-end pet stores. Don't get ripped off. This is a total waste of money if you live in a town with at least one Asian grocery store. Go to your Asian grocery, preferably Japanese, and purchase dried bonito flakes, i.e. katsuobushi. Katsuobushi is way cheaper and probably much better quality, as it's meant for human consumption. There should only be one ingredient. Bonito. One of the ingredients we Japanese use to make dashi stock. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 mislead,1,"The selection offered in this gift set is appealing however the price volume ratio is not worth the purchase. Having reviewed the other comments and information my expectations were no where near what arrived. What did arrive was a set of boxes roughly the size of what you might get at a jewelery store and stacked the height of a barbie doll. I feel that for the cost I could have gotten some microwave popcorn, pretzel sticks and a bag of choclate and accomplished the same feat for a fraction of the cost with no dissapointment and more than likely impressed the recipant 10 times over! I would highly reccomend weighing any alternatives prior to purchasing this product first e.g. a gift bag and items found at your local grocery store if you want your monies worth. …",23 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 the best gluten-free baking mix I have found,5,"My daughter has celiac (a complete inability to eat any wheat, rye, barley, and in her case oatmeal, or any of their starches or glutens). Pamela's baking and pancake mix is a real heaven-sent product. It tastes good! Unlike some other baking mixes I have tried. It is easy to alter ""normal"" recipes using Pamela's mix to have great tasting baked products. The bag has good recipes and Pamela's products website has additional ones. I would recommend this product to anyone, especially those who don't want to take the time to mix their own grains or want to keep it on hand for when celiac family or friends come to visit and you would like to provide a delicious, easy to make treat. I should also add - Pamela's also offers bread, cake (chocolate and vanilla), brownie, and cookie mixes that are very good. I usually just alter the baking mix to make these baked goods, but I keep a chocolate cake mix on hand for a fast, easy cake. We used the chocolate cake mix for my daughter's wedding cake. No on knew it was gluten-free. …",105 out of 105 users found this review helpful
