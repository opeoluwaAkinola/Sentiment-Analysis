" Manuka honey, nature's perfect food!",5,"I've been eating domestic raw honey for a while now to soothe my stomach, but turned to the ""stronger"" (and obviously more expensive) manuka honey after hearing about its healing capabilities. When I received the Wedderspoon organic manuka honey, I opened it up, and smelled its interesting aroma. It almost has a hint of antiseptic smell to it, along with the sweet honey scent. And it tastes like it smells, but you do get used to it, and it is absolutely delicious. It is thinner and runnier than ""Really Raw"" brand american honey, so I find myself eating it faster, which is fine except I am about to run out shortly after buying it. But for me, an admittedly starving artist who is notoriously thrifty, it is still definitely worth the money. So what has it done for me? It calms my heartburn, helps my digestion, reduces nausea associated with IBS, and I've used it on a skin infection with great success. All while being completely natural and delicious. I am very pleased with this honey - if you've read about the benefits of manuka honey you will be pleased to find that it does everything they says it does [and more]. I will be ordering one more jar from Superstore, before moving to New Zealand at the end of the summer, where I will be quite excited to buy it locally! …",129 out of 132 users found this review helpful
 Mild but not Bland or Tasteless,5,"Currently, this is the only K-Cup 50 pack listed as ""mild"" on Superstore. I was expecting something with only a little flavor and bitterness, but these K-Cups surprised me. They're not as strong as the bold or extra bold flavors, but the difference is reasonably subtle. They're certainly not bland or tasteless. Also, they do taste to me a little sweet and smoky - just as they are described above. A note about packaging: when I bought a Coffee People 50 pack from Superstore, the K-Cups came in only one box - a thick, corrugated cardboard Coffee People box. Superstore just stuck the mailing labels on the box and gave it to USPS. When this coffee arrived, the K-Cups were in a thin Timothy's cardboard box, which Superstore had put inside one of their standard corrugated cardboard boxes. The upshot is that these Timothy's 50 packs are mailed double-boxed, unlike the Coffee People 50 packs, and so it seems less likely that the Timothy's 50 packs will get damaged in the mail. …",56 out of 57 users found this review helpful

 SmokeHouse USA?!?  Don't Think So...,1,"I guess if you want to keep raking in the money you have to fudge and mislead folk. That's what SmokeHouse has done by adding 'USA' to their name. I can say this without fear because the packages I have sitting on the kitchen table in front of me clearly say that this is a ""Product of China."" You know, the China where they feel free to add melamine to products for human babies (2008), and dogs and cats (2007 and 2010) -- all so that the protein levels register higher than they normally would :( I am so disappointed. Honestly, my little Jack-a-Bee puppy loves their products, but I won't be purchasing the Chicken Chips or Chicken Breast Strips again. I can't imagine telling my children that the lively little pup they love was made sick (or died!) because of some cheap-*** short-cut. I'd rather pay more money and have it manufactured here in the States. Pam T~ mom/blogger/dog lover …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Refuting the 2-Star Review.,5,"Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation. So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked ""natural""), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those. Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.

 Aussies love this stuff?,1,"Ok, I probably should have known better. I heard on tv that most Americans that try this stuff hate it. So I had to get a small jar to find out. Well, guess what SURPRISE, I hated it. I like real limburger cheese, I mean the really stinky stuff but couldn't stand this. One bite and I thought I was eating old gym socks wrapped in spoiled meat that had been left in the sun in plastic for weeks. Don't get me wrong for ppl that like this stuff. More power to you.

 Absolutely delicious!,5,I have been a slim fast drinker for years. One taste of this shake and I'm hooked! I like to put it in the freezer for about 30 min. before drinking it so it is nice and COLD. I love chocolate so the milk chocolate flavor is my pick. It is a much smoother chocolate than the slim fast milk chocolate. I just wish it came in 6 or bonus 8 pack like the slim fast. So far I've only seen it in 4 pack. Because of this it is a bit more costly than slim fast. But again the taste is much better. I highly recommend it!! …,16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 very functional but too flimsy to last,3,"Got 3 of these to salve my recycle conscience and save on cost. I have the smallest of the Keurigs and drink 2 cups a day, so I figured I could keep 2 clean. The good news is that size is perfect, fits beautifully and brew is excellent (just using my adc ground Green Mtn coffee). They work great and are 5 star for that. However, they are made in china of all plastic, including the important hinge top that is the one moving part. I am super careful with this, but it's just plastic, rather flimsy, and there's no way it's going to last repeated openings, which of course are necessary for both filling and cleaning. This would not be a killer if they weren't so relatively expensive. I'm sure it can't have cost the producers even a dollar for these. Either upgrade quality or downgrade price! …",50 out of 54 users found this review helpful

 Good product but NOT VEGETARIAN.,3,"This was the first container of rice cereal that our baby has tried. He took to it very well, and I thougth buying the DHA formula cereal was a smart choice for his development as opposed to the regular. Unfortunately, I realized just as the container was almost gone (and I had already bought another container) that this product has tuna oil, as well as gelatin in it. It is the source of DHA. It's my fault for not reading the label more closely, but I really would have never guessed that a single grain baby cereal would have fish oil in it! The formula we use also had DHA, but it is algae-based. Just wondering why this has to be from a fish. Gross. …",4 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 My taste buds were overloaded after having just 2 cookies,1,"With all the talk of Snackwells being low in sugar, their cookies seem to be a little sweet on the flavoring side.

 Believe the 5 star reviews!,5,"This brand of tuna well deserves all the 5 star reviews. It IS tasty tuna chunks w/ a small amt. of creamy pink juice that I used instead of squeezing out to make tuna salad.There is no fishy taste as it is more like fresh tuna. I compare this tuna to switching from box wine to bottle wine-once you make the leap to this tuna you will never want to go back to the typical grocery store variety or even the higher grade brands available on Superstore. The 3 brands I used to buy on Superstore were Polar's yellowfin steak, Natural Value's yellowfin, and Wild Oats light tongol, all packed in water. Until I tried this brand I was content w/ those brands. I just hope Superstore continues to carry this brand and it stays at this price point. …",24 out of 26 users found this review helpful

" Well, they tried...",2,"The Cookies and Cream flavor turned out to be a disappointment from the moment the carton was opened. As other reviewers have mentioned the color is disturbing, an unappetizing solid purplish grey. It's not an easy or very appealing color to describe. The taste is similar. At no time would I ever describe it as Cookies and Cream, it more of an overly sweetened bad vanilla? I can't quite put my finger on what the flavor is. Something went wrong in the Arctic Zero kitchen on this one. It's not so bad that it has to go in the trash,(especially after the hefty price tag) but I have to add toppings to help it go down easier.

 Try it,5,"The reviews as of today are correct. Navitas Naturals is a great brand. I prefer the cacao powder to the nibs but then freshness isn't a factor. I use a pound in no time. Be aware however, this is not a processed food. I've bought three pounds of cacao powder and all are slightly different in taste. I assume the Maca would be the same. Now..as to the taste. Well...it is different. Nothing something I would buy for the taste. It is smokey, deep, complex and if you take a lot, somewhat gagging. But I added 2 tbls to a 32 oz smoothie and couldn't really tell it was there (but then I loaded it down with cacao powder). It is also hydroscopic. More than instant potatos. Not as much as psyllium. Takes a few minutes to hydrate. Don't underestimate how much water it will absorb. It takes a lot. Medicinal benefits? I can't even sort out the anecdotal evidence I and those in my family I've given it to have experienced. Lots of clinical studies on the net. My concern, because liver failure was an issue, was it did no harm. And I don't see it did. Nor do I read of any in the literature. The five stars is twofold: I trust the brand (the packaging is great..it stands up in the cupboard and has a plastic liner. Light is kept out by the brown wrapper, water and air by the liner). Why not? The price is OK. Foodies (of which I am one) should know about Maca and this amount gives you more than enough to fool around with using it. Might be a recipe out there which needs a tsp or so of Maca in it to give it depth. Pills are usually overpriced and I want to see and taste the raw product (well not with some pills but with supplements which are also foods). …",31 out of 41 users found this review helpful
 This is gluten free.,5,"I am not sure what the other reviewer is referring to but the Organic Gluten Free Tamari travel packs are gluten free. I almost didn't order this because of the reviewer. I rushed to my pantry and pulled out the bottle of Tamari that I have to cook with and could find nothing that the reviewer referred to as having wheat in it. I have a gluten allergy. I am bummed when I go out for sushi & the establishment does not carry Tamari (wheat free soy sauce) so I usually fill a little container from home when I go out for sushi (often). When I saw the travel packs I was thrilled and ordered it. On the packaging, it states that it is certified gluten free. The ingredients are: Water, Organic Soybeans, Salt, Organic Alcohol.

 Super Hot Sauce,5,"The label on Frank's Hot Sauce says ""The Perfect Blend of Flavor and Heat"" and I must say this is an accurate description of the product. Frank's Hot Sauce is outstanding. It's a Cheyenne Pepper based hot sauce that is not too hot, not too sweet, but has just a perfect blend of ""flavor and heat."" It's not like Tobasco sauce which is very hot and you sprinkle on items. It's a different kind of sauce (I love Tobasco). Frank's is a hot sauce you can use more liberally to your liking because, while it's hot, it's not so hot you can't really dig into it and enjoy the rich flavor and spices. I like to use this sauce to dip chicken tenders in, but you can also use it too cook buffalo wings, put it on eggs, French fries, burgers, whatever you like. I like this size because I use a lot of it and it goes fast at smaller sizes. I highly recommend this hot sauce. …",20 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Makes 13 Quarts of WHOLE Milk,4,"Instant Dry Whole Milk. According to the label, this 3.52 lb can makes about 13 quarts. Rather expensive per quart, compared to fresh milk from the grocery store, but cheaper than a trip to the store when I run out of milk and need some quickly. Ingredients: Whole Milk, Soy Lecithin, Vitamin A Acetate, Vitamin D3 (per label). Imported from Chile.

I consumed one bag of this then immediately changed to organic years ago.

 Content means less than names,2,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed. Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food. Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm? …",6 out of 49 users found this review helpful

 Good price and an okay product but cheap looking bamboo gift box,2,"Superstore has a good price on this product compare to other places. This tea set is allright, and the idea to have the flowering tea is kind of cool, (There are better tasting flowering tea in the market such as Harney & Sons.) however. the bamboo box that contain the tea set is poorly made. The orange paint on the box will come off on your fingers when you touch it, and you need to be careful not to get splinters when you are openning the box.

 Excellent dog food!,5,"Currently I have a five months old bichon frise. When I first got him as a puppy, I thought I picked out the best food for him, Blue Buffalo at Petsmart. However, when I got home, I did more research and found Orijen. As owners of bichons, or malteses, or poodles know, they tend to have problems with tear staining because of their white fur. Since I already got him Blue Buffalo, I thought I'll finish it before switching. Because of the tomato pomace (it's the leftover tomato seed, pulp, and skin) in the ingredients list, he had tear staining problems. I did nightly cleanings of his eyes, but it was still noticeable. Now it's been a month since Orijen Puppy, and I just realized that it's been a few weeks since I had to clean his eyes. Even my friends who visit us constantly commented on just how clean and bright his eyes look. Besides helping with the tear staining, Orijen is an all-around great food. I've also noticed his coat has a sheen to it. His poops are solid, not too soft or hard. He loves it, gobbles it down each time. I am extremely excited about feeding him this awesome food! And I will whole-heartedly recommend this dog food to anyone. It's totally worth it. …",42 out of 42 users found this review helpful
 Expensive Junk,1,"There you think the name Rachael Ray would be associated with a high quality product.... it isn't. Perhaps Rachael doesn't know what a high quality ingredient is.

 probably not from the Texas Ranch ...,3,"Jim Davis may have been a Texas Rancher but the beef is sourced from ""USA or Uruguay or New Zealand or Australia and further processed in USA"" the flavor is overpowering, which I guess I should have expected from ""hickory"" but it doesn't taste like hickory smoke to me, it tastes like corn syrup (or maybe that's the hydrolyzed soy protein?) it's got enough hydrogenated this-and-that to fuel the Hindenburg. It's also loaded with sodium, which most jerky is, but it really *tastes* salty too. The meat is tender because it was tenderized with papain which is an enzyme in papayas (thanks Wikipedia) there does seem to be a good amount of gristly threads running through it. That doesn't really bother me so much, but it's definitely not ""naturally tender"" meat. This stuff is marginally edible but I wouldn't buy it again.

 BEST FLAVOR; BEST PRICES; ALWAYS FRESH,5,"I've been using the Nutiva brand for 2 years now. It has the best flavor of any of the brands in the nutrition and grocery stores. When I used the other brands I rarely used the coconut oil. They smelled and tasted yucky. Plus I found out they were processed. Nutiva is raw. I have completely thrown out shortening; butter; and probably cut back at least half on the olive oil I used. My chronically dry skin is gone without lotions. I use it on toast or bread as a snack and I feel full and satisfied for hours. And I have seen a lot less water retention all over....not so puffy.

 99$ What the heck?,1,"For the record, my review is not about the taste of Vegemite, I understand that it is an acquired taste. ""like it or not"". My complaint is about the price of this product in particular, 99$. Who in the right mind would pay 99$ for this! There better be gold shavings, ambrosia, and ground Rhino horns in this 99$ jar of Vegemite. To top it off, there is a deal to get four 150g jars of Vegemite for $38 on Superstore from the same seller of the same exact product and brand. Hmm. . . 600g for 38$, 1800g for 115$ or 400g for 99$? Seriously though, what the heck is with this pricing Kraft? I may be wrong for assuming this, but the other reviews I have read for this product are for Vegemite in general, which does deserve 4~5 stars. This particular product however deserves a 1 and for good reasons. …",2 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 A very healthy breakfast cereal with just a few minor drawbacks...,4,"Product 19 is an excellent breakfast cereal. It has absolutely no fat, no trans fat, no cholesterol, and it is rather low in sugar content. Excellent! Product 19 even has 100% of vitamins C, E, B12, B16, iron and other nutrients as well. Very impressive! (Superstore states that it has only 10% of these nutrients but that is incorrect.) On the other hand, the cereal is low in fiber and it contains sodium and carbohydrates. Check the label to see if you're comfortable with the amounts of ALL the ingredients in this cereal before buying it. Product 19 is something that grew on me; I initially didn't like it but I kept eating it in the morning for health reasons. Over time I appreciated the taste more and more. This may be true for you, too. Not everyone will find this cereal to be tasty the very first time they eat it. You could add a few strawberries or blueberries on top of the cereal to make it sweeter; these berries are also very healthy for you, too. The packaging is attractive. The sealed plastic bag inside the box keeps the cereal fresh even a couple of months beyond the expiration date on the box. Overall, Product 19 is an excellent cereal for people who care about what they eat. It may take a little getting used to because of the taste and the consistency of the cereal flakes. Despite the ""taste factor"" and a few drawbacks concerning sodium and carbohydrates, I highly recommend this cereal as part of a healthy diet. …",9 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 3 Year Old Will Eat His Veggies!,4,"My 3 year old hated lettuce before we purchased the Aerogarden. After watching the leaves grow, he is always asking for the lettuce. We no longer have problems getting him to eat his salads and he loves to snack on the leaves! We all do! The only downside- the outside leaves are not that pretty, and the lettuce does not stay lush and full. But it's still great to look at. Customer service is also great and they quickly sent replacements for the seeds that did not sprout. Follow-up! I called aerogarden and let them know about my not so pretty outer lettuce leaves after about 6 weeks of growth. They immediately sent a replacement seed kit. The new seed kit has grown VERY full and lush, much better than the first kit. I was told to call back with any problems. Customer service really wants you to be completely happy. I am impressed!

So far I've only used it to sweeten my coffee, but the result is absolutely pure sweetness. I couldn't ask for a better taste. Now, granted sugar sets a standard, but sugar has a taste that comes additive to sweetness; SweetLeaf has a bit of an additive taste to it, too, and it ain't sugar, but neither is it something horribly bitter like some of the other stevia products.

 As much as I LOVE this soup mix....it'll kill you!!!,1,"I truly love the flavor of this soup mix but it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil. That means it has 'trans fats' that effectively cause hardening of the arteries and heart disease. That's not even mentioning that it has soybean products in it. Soybeans (except for the fermented forms like tempah) elevate one's estrogen levels which can increase the chance of cancer risks...especially estrogen mediated breast cancers. And it has Autolyzed Yeast Extract which is another name for the infamous neurotoxin....MSG (monosodium glutamate). I don't understand why this well known company has to use dangerous ingredients when there are so many substitutes that will not destroy our populations health. Is it purely because it's so much cheaper to use these dangerous, life threatening products that they only see their profit margins and not the health of the nation.

" Bonito dust not flakes, but if you can't get to a store.....okay",2,"My previous experience: 100gram bags, multiple ( 4 bags) from a ( now closed and gone) Japanese Market, priced at less than $6.00 per bag. At the time of purchase, I did see two other brands available ( they were in Japanese, so I really couldn't read them), but they look similar to this one, crushed, so I didn't buy. I own 2 cats: one very easy to feeds-will try and usually eats ANYTHING put down before him/the other VERY PARTICULAR, usually sniffs but won't eat. They both LOVED the bonito I have purchased in the past. Neither will eat the 'crumbs'/dust found at the bottom of the bag without it being mixed with water and turned into a paste. I've been know to sample a little, for a little protein. REVIEW: Look at the photo of this item. Do you see how the product appears to fill the bag? It SHOULD when it is in it's prime. I received my two bags ordered and there was WAY too much air space in the box! The bonito was compacted in both bags. I hope they were compressed, but not crushed, but alas, that was not to be. I usually pull out (kind of with a pinching motion)/pluck about 1/2 cup loosely placed easily. This stuff was so distroyed, it just fell from my fingers because the pieces were far too small to ""pluck"" from the bag. I wouldn't buy this again now that I spent the time and hunted down a Japanese Market. Or maybe if the store burned down/closed down. BETTER SOURCE, if you can travel there: I have since hunted down a new Japanese Market, Japantown in San Jose, California. I didn't have time to search San Ramon, CA, but I did look in Fremont and Newark area, with no luck. All locations have large populations of Asians [I'm Chinese and yes, I AM using THAT TERM-get over it!] I searched the web for locations, so there might be closer locations somewhere, but I don't know where. I bought multiple bags varying in price and found: LEARNED: Price you pay doesn't matter. LOOK at what you are buying. Dust/Crumbs are ALWAYS bad news. A smaller bag with bigger flakes is more desireable. I paid up to $8 a bag, and STILL found the under $6 a bag better in quality (bigger flakes, less dust). The checkout girl had a cat and SHE RECOMMENDED/suggested the one I and the cats liked best, both in quality and price thing in this case. FYI, I found a 40g bag with narrower slices, blue label, but it didn't seem to taste as good for some reason. BRAND doesn't matter. My original bags appear to be the one pictured, that is why I bought it. I guess they could of been crushed BEFORE SHIPPING or in transit from too much jostling. I hope this helped someone in their quest. End note, buying this DOES beat paying the price for the FAR overpriced stuff at the pet store by far. …",8 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Updated - Now BPA Free available,5,"UPDATE - I heard that Muir Glen had started transitioning their canned tomato products to BPA free cans but when contacting Muir Glen (General Mills), I kept getting a canned (no pun intended) response that they believe BPA is safe...blah blah blah. But today, I finally got the answers I was looking for including how to tell which cans at the grocery store are BPA free. Muir Glen started transitioning to BPA free cans (for their tomato products only) in September 2010. Their shelf life is 2 1/2 years; therefore, an expiration date after March 2013 should be a BPA free can liner. You can confirm it is BPA free when you open the can because the old BPA liner was white, but the new BPA free liner is a copper color. I did ask General Mills to please label their products BPA free to help us consumers when shopping. I hope that eventually all canned goods will be BPA free. Let me know what you find when shopping. I am so excited to have a BPA free Organic tomato product, yay! Thanks Muir Glen! Old Review - I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES--remember how many women died of cancer because of DES?) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder. I wrote to Muir Glen to see if they had any plans to try and remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. Some companies are concerned and working to remove BPA (Eden Organics) while others are defending BPA--they are the ones that really upset me (Del Monte and Coca Cola are some of the worst--I won't buy ANY of their products anymore). Eden Organics has removed BPA from their canned bean products and is working to remove it from their canned tomato products. Vital Choices is the only company I know of that has gone 100% BPA free but they sell mostly canned fish and a few other products but no canned tomatoes. I have switched to fresh food or jarred foods--no more cans for our family unless they are BPA free. The lids of most jars have a little BPA but so much less BPA is leeched out compared to a whole can lining, still I would prefer NO BPA. It just makes me sick that I fed my children with baby bottles that contained BPA. I gave my children synthetic estrogen! We already have prostate cancer in our family, and now I have increased my son's chance of prostate cancer even more by using BPA estrogen laden baby bottles--ugh!!!!! Contact Muir Glen and tell them you want BPA free cans! We as shoppers, have a lot of power if we decide to use it. In fact, contact all the companies that you buy canned goods from and let them know you don't want to feed your family BPA anymore. Let me know if you find any tomato products (diced, crushed, paste, ...) that are BPA free by responding to this comment--I will get an email. I desperately want to make my chicken cacciatore again! I just read some more about BPA, Minnesota has banned BPA and several states are also trying to pass legislation to do the same. So write to your legislators about banning BPA! I also read the following from Fran Pavley the sponsor of California's BPA ban: ""Well over 100 independent academic and government peer-reviewed studies have linked BPA to a host of problems, including brain and developmental damage, breast and prostrate cancer, early puberty, obesity, infertility, miscarriage and hyperactivity. Young children and babies are particularly vulnerable because their body systems are still developing. Still, the chemical industry remains in denial. It has employed more than a dozen lobbyists to kill my bill. Lobbyists for popular formula brands are roaming the halls of the Capitol, telling my colleagues that alternative products aren&iexcl;¦t available, and a ban on BPA could cause a formula shortage. Yet at the same time, these companies are marketing a variety of formula and food containers to parents as ""BPA free""."" Scary!!! …",49 out of 57 users found this review helpful

 Vanilla Paste is terrific,4,"Based on recommendation from King Arthur Flour (KAF), I bought the vanilla bean paste. It came in quickly. I tried it and came to several conclusions. First, the flavor is outstanding..rich vanilla flavor. As described at KAF, the paste contained small vanillla bean specks which were visible in the lighter colored preps I made, like French Vanilla ice cream. It gave the preparations a special touch. One caution. If used in a thin batter, the specks will sink to the bottom. I learned this when I made Creme Brulee. The vanilla flavor was great, but at the bottom of the ramekin were all the bean specks. Use the paste in recipes where the specks will stay suspended and not sink. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Mild sweet tea,5,I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose. Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth. I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea. Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening. …,24 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on,5,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups. I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive. I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products. If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :) EcoBrew VS Solofill First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew. Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker. These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable! I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product. The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly. …",559 out of 562 users found this review helpful

 Natural Flavors?  Shame on Walnut Acres,1,"I saw the words Natural Flavors on the label of this bottle. Since this notation is used to hide monosodium glutamate (MSG), a flavor enhancer, I called the number on the bottle. The woman at Walnut Acres said the Natural Flavor included a vegetable extract but not MSG as the law requires the ingredient to be labeled if used. The law really states it is required by the FDA that food manufacturers list the ingredient ""monosodium glutamate"" on food labels, but they do not have to label ingredients that contain free glutamic acid, even though it's the main component of MSG. Glutamic acid is an extract of a seaweed which certainly is classified as a vegetable. Glutamic acid is a slow killer which should be banned but I regret to say our FDA is not always acting in our best interests. What is also sad is that this company tries to pass this off as Organic.

 Minty Chamomile for Sweet Dreams,5,"Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning.

" Wow, wow, WOW.",5,"First off, I'd like to explain that I am not a professional, but do try to make fantastic cakes at home and for friends. I have worked as a cake decorator in a small town before, but did not get started in fondant until the last few years, on my own at home. I started with Wilton (YUCK!), and then found Satin Ice, which is good stuff. But, I kept reading reviews that raved on Fondarific Buttercream flavored fondant, and how much easier it was to work with, etc. So, I bit and bought some via the subscription ($10/2 lbs and free shipping?? Awesome!) When it arrived, I immediately checked for an expiration date. My heart sank. 06312. That means ""63rd day of 2012"". I thought that meant it had expired, but before I went to send it back, I double checked the manufacturer website. Come to find out, that is the *manufactured* date, and it would expire 1-2 years AFTER that date. So... my fondant batch was MADE on the 63rd day of 2012. Fresh! Awesome! Upon first opening, I actually let out an ""OMG"". The smell was divine! It smelled of vanilla and buttery goodness, like good homemade buttercream icing. It seemed like a hard ball of fondant inside the packaging, but I was able to break a small piece off. Upon rolling around in my fingers just a few seconds, it softened beautifully and was very pliable. No crust fell off, no crumbles.. just smooth. And surprisingly, not sticky! I even stuck a fingernail in to see if it would stick under my nails, and it wouldn't. I keep my nails super short, but it always seems like I get fondant under my fingers when I work with it. Not with this test. So, of course.. I had to try some. And it was as good as it smelled! Sweet buttercream flavor, but not ungodly sweet like most fondants are. And it tastes authentic... not like artificial butter or super strong vanilla. No weird off flavors, either. And the aftertaste was just butter and vanilla, not ""chemicals"". I don't know how to describe it, but some fondants can taste ""chemical-y"". This stuff doesn't have any of that. Usually, I tear off the fondant from cake I eat. This stuff? I'd almost definitely eat with the cake, especially if it rolls as thin as the manufacturer says it can. According to the website, it can take almost 50% less than what the Wilton Fondant chart calls for. More bang for your buck if that holds true. The taste was so impressive, I bought some more to try out that others had mentioned was a good flavor (has not arrived yet). I bought this fondant ahead of time for a cake I'm going to make at the end of May, so I have not yet rolled it out and covered a cake yet. But so far? I'm impressed. I plan to update this review once I have covered a cake. (if you look at my other reviews, you'll find that I have a habit of reviewing and then updating after with what I have learned). Keep in mind this, though: unlike Satin Ice, Fondarific is meant just for flat decorations. It stays soft, so any 3d stuff you try and make will never harden. If you need to make 3d fondant figures or flowers, they recommend 1/2 Fondarific to 1/3 gumpaste, which will be what I try. They also recommend Tylose powder to firm it up, but from what I've read on cake decorating boards, no one has had any luck with this method. Worst case scenario? Go all gumpaste, or buy Satin Ice to do 3d figures. But for what this is, and the price compared to other fondants online (and considering free shipping), this is a good buy. Also, this color ""Antique White"" really is an off white. I want to make a ""story book"" cake, so this is perfect for that color of book pages. It's like it has just the slightest beige tint to it. If you want something really white, consider their ""Wedding white"" color. Stay tuned for my update on it's performance in cake coverage and fondant thickness used! …",25 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 not quite tricky enough and high mess potential,2,"I got this toy because I wanted my cat to work a little for his food. This toy was not the cat-torturing puzzle I was hoping for. Unfortunately, my cat figured out how to get the food out efficiently in under 3 minutes. It's not terribly tricky as the toy is essentially a hollow plastic ball with a hole in one side. Food comes out almost every time my cat taps the ball. It comes out so easily, more comes out than he sometimes wants to eat in one sitting. I often find little trails of kibble all over the living room. Still, I guess having to tap the ball a few times to get his food is more work than just eating it out of a bowl. Also, you can pry the ball open so that you can clean it, which is a plus. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
" Delicious with 5 spice aromas, not full of sugar and cream",5,"This India Spice Chai while brewing fills the whole room with wonderful aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves almost like the Chinese 5 spice blend. There is no added sugar or cream so if you want that go with Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack . Those k-cups which are delicious as well have the cream that many expect in a chai tea. This particular brand of Celestial Seasonings is just tea. You can add what you want after the fact. I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing. This is just a nice cup of spiced tea. It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most. I really like it and highly recommend. …",27 out of 28 users found this review helpful
 I had to throw out all the Dogswell products I purchased,1,"I purchase almost daily from Superstore and recommend Superstore to my friends constantly. I think that makes me a very good customer. I have a very serious concern. When Superstore sells pet food and/or treats made in China they must be disclosed on the Superstore page as ""MADE IN CHINA"". No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Superstore will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China. As a loyal customer, I expect Superstore to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Superstore MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products! If Superstore is too ashamed to disclose the source, then Superstore should not sell it! One Star is much too high a rating. I had to throw out all the Dogswell products I purchased, Shame on Superstore for selling without disclosing the source! …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 DANGEROUS BONES!!!!,1,DANGEROUS BONES!!! Little dogs love these bones because they are tasty BUT they are truly dangerous. Our family Maltese (Pebbles) who had just turned one choked to death on one. They are not even safe if your supervising your dog because our dog choked on one in the presence of my sister. We were unable to do anything for her as we watched in horror as she slowly stopped breathing and got her to the vet in less than ten minutes. The vet attempted an emergency procedure and removed two peices and the bone had also tore her trachea. Her death was caused by these bones. These bones are not worth your precious pets life as it tore our family apart. …,10 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Mild sweet tea,5,I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose. Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth. I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea. Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening. …,24 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Beware of Xylitol,1,"Don't let your Dogs get anywhere near gum with Zylitol in it. Don't leave it where a dog will accidentally get into it!!

They don't know yet why but if just a minute portion of a it, will kill your dog, what does it do to you? I just don't chew gum anymore since it is so hard to find just old fashioned regular gum with sugar and no additives. Aspartame;bad, Xylitol;worse. They all change motablism.

 My taste buds were overloaded after having just 2 cookies,1,"With all the talk of Snackwells being low in sugar, their cookies seem to be a little sweet on the flavoring side.

 DO NOT waste your money,1,"If something sounds too good to be true, it is. These Miracle Noodles (should be called Nasty Noodles) are exactly that. Although the fishy smells washes off with proper rinsing and boiling the texture of the noodles is nauseating. I was literally gagging as I tried to swallow them. When you chew them they break a part like some odd watery substance. I tried the noodles twice, two different ways (once stir-fried and the other in a soup) and both times I was absolutely repulsed by their texture. I ended up throwing the remaining 3 packs in the garbage. Miracle Noodles may have no calories, but they also have no place in my mouth. They were disgusting and I caution you all! Plus, you can find them in your local grocery store for much cheaper (they are called shirataki noodles) …",33 out of 41 users found this review helpful

 Dark Magic is my kind of Magic,5,"Green Mountain's Dark Magic Extra Bold is my go-to coffee for use with my Keurig coffee machine. I go through more of this particular flavor then any other type of coffee. In fact I don't think a day goes by that I don't have at least 1 cup of this flavor, if not more. Don't let the words dark and extra bold scare you off - this coffee is rich, smooth and in many ways mellow. Its not overly acidic, it does't taste burnt, its just a good cup of ""coffee flavored coffee"". It works well with most flavored creamers, sweeteners, but is a pleasant cup in its pure and unadorned form as well. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Superb oil for health,5,"I've tried others, but Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is by far the tastiest and easiest to eat. I absolutely love it. I just eat it right out of the jar, several tablespoonfuls a day, for the health and weight loss benefits. I wholeheartedly recommend it. I've read through the reviews and just wanted to clarify some things with actual facts for those who are interested. Saturated fat, such as coconut oil, butter, lard, tallow, etc., is not only NOT harmful, but it is ESSENTIAL for good health and need not and should not be limited in quantity as the government suggests. It does NOT clog arteries--that is a lie that has been propagated for the last 60 years and thankfully there are finally practitioners with the courage and common sense to speak the truth. I am a dentist, intimately involved in nutrition, and I know what I'm talking about. The majority of coconut oil is medium chain triglycerides which are broken down quickly by the liver for energy. It raises metabolic rate, thus promoting weight loss, and it does work. But you should know that butter is healthy, too, and has some important long chain fatty acids, and it, too, will promote weight loss. Heavy cream is essentially butter before it's been churned. So certainly eat coconut oil--it has myriad health benefits--but eat all your saturated fats, including plenty of fatty, red meat. Coconut oil will not oxidize and go rancid. You can leave it on the counter probably for years. So don't worry about buying too much. And for the same reason, a dark jar is not necessary. Please know that liquid seed and nut oils, and even fish oil, will go rancid, because of the high unsaturated content. These oils oxidize quickly and form free radicals. They are a major contributing factor in virtually all the prevalent diseases and disorders from which people suffer. And finally to those complaining of the plastic jar, most of us, especially those who use a lot of coconut oil, would just as soon accept the ""horrifying"" risks of plastic jars rather than paying a fortune for shipping glass jars. We don't all have extra bags of cash lying around. …",114 out of 122 users found this review helpful
 Great Cookie,5,"These cookies are a little pricey in my opinion but you always pay more for natural food products and these cookies are made from natural ingredients. Sometimes you do not get that many cookies in a bag but that's okay, just go eat another bag of cookies. :) They taste great and have mostly if not 100% natural ingredients. I have made many orders for these cookies and plan on making more orders for them in the future. Highly recommended if you are looking for a delicious, individually packaged, chocolate chip cookie snack. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 This one supplement has changed my life!!!!!,5,"I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.) None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life. That is, until Natural Calm. This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically! Here are the things this supplement has helped with: Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night. Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations. Mood--- Made me generally happier. Decreased muscle cramping and soreness. Improved gums and teeth. Improved hair loss. Improved digestion and transit time. Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too! But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really. There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Superstore if you want more science of magnesium.) I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement. If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want. Here's wishing you great health! …",37 out of 46 users found this review helpful

 My dogs love it!,5,"I have a 4 year old Boston Terrier/Jack Russell mix and a 2 year old Boxer/American Bulldog mix who had been eating Purina Beneful (Healthy Radiance) since I have owned them. I noticed the younger dog was emitting a nasty odor through his coat and the older dog was itching all over. After doing some research I found this food highly recommended online. The difference in the foods is the ingredients. This food contains REAL meat and by-products. Though I was skeptical because it was more expensive, it was well worth it.

 This filter works PERFECT!,5,"Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the ""old fashion way"" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size. I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Superstore, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry. The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew! …",472 out of 477 users found this review helpful
 Heavenly,5,"After reading how good Agave Nectar is for you and a number of excellent reviews, I decided to take the plunge and order Madhava's Agave Nectar Light in the 46 oz. bottles, pack of two. Not having a clue as to how good or bad this product was going to taste, I was very nervous and wondered if I had made a wise decision or big mistake. I couldn't wait to try it and was delightfully surprised. In tea, it tastes sweeter than sugar. In smoothies, it's sensational. Even a spoonful is wonderful. My husband loves it in his oatmeal and I like to mix it with dehydrated coconut and raw cacao nibs for a real treat.
