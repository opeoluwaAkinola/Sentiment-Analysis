 Poor KCup manufacturing and OK coffee-- UPDATE,1,"I received this last week and was surprised that there were coffee grounds all over the Superstore box. I thought it might be one of the kcups inside had broken and that was the case but it appeared that none of the kcups inside were damaged. That being said the outside packaging looked promising, great design. Overall I have been underwhelmed by the quality of the coffee. It tastes old and weak. Plus the Kcups look like they were hand done and don't have the uniformity I would expect from a professional Kcup manufacturer. I've ordered multiple different brews from the Brooklyn Bean Roastery so I'm hoping some of the next versions will be done with higher quality. While it isn't my favorite coffee by any means it is drinkable and I'm going to try different size cups to see if I can get it to be a bit more bold and rich. -----UPDATE: So I finally received the rest of my order Fuhgeddaboudit and Cyclone. All of these have been less than average. The kcup packaging is flawed in each case I received. I also dislike all of the different coffee styles. Each one tastes like the grounds are dry and stale. Although I'd like to blame quality control I really think the coffee itself is just bad. Either way I will definitely not be buying coffee from this company again and I would warn everyone reading these reviews to stay away as well. All their 5 star reviews are from people that don't have verified orders. I wasted my money... don't waste yours. …",7 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Placebo,1,"My girlfriend and I decided to try 5-hour energy because we both like Red Bull but didn't like the ""crashing"" effect it can have after a little while. First off, Superstore's price is absolutely ridiculous. You should be able to get a 24 pack of this stuff for around $33 (at Sam's, etc.). Secondly, this stuff tastes gross (we had the berry flavored...more like vomit berry favor). Thirdly and MOST importantly: it didn't do anything except make us actually more tired. We couldn't stop yawning about 20 minutes after shooting our drinks down. I've read the negative reviews that other people have written...believe them and save your money! The positive reviews I am convinced are by people who are affected by the placebo effect. They think they should be more awake, so they ""feel"" more energized... …",6 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 This stuff really works!,5,"Deer Off really does keep deer, woodchucks and rabbits from eating our garden plants, shrubs and trees. It works winter and summer in our semi-rural southern Wisconsin location. Rain will wash it off, but usually applying it every few weeks does the trick. I recommend using the concentrate. Keep the bottle in your refrigerator. No, it won't make your 'frige stink! We mix it up as needed and spray it with an inexpensive plastic pressurized sprayer. Diluted concentrate in the sprayer does not spoil, but will freeze in the winter as it is water-based. The concetrate seems expensive, but it's much cheaper than buying the pre-mixed version. Just a light application on each plant is all that's needed to be effective. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" A good, supermarket  shelf  romano",3,"most of the romano you find at the supermarket is made from cows milk and of course, this is not romano.This product,while a little dusty in texture,is made froms sheeps milk,as all romano should be.That also means it does not contain the casein you get from cows milk and which clogs the arteries.The flavor(with some of the perservatives in it) is okay but not something to write home about; but it is decent and I would buy it again in a pinch. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" Get educated, save $",1,"Even at $6 per canister, this product is inexplicably overpriced. Let me explain why: Intro to Oats 101--Oats, in whole form, are known as groats. In an effort to cut down on cooking time (or eating time, for those on the run, who don't have the time or patience to chew @mouthful 20-30x), oats are refined into the following: -steel cut oats--cracked into two or more pieces -oat flakes--flattened with an oat roller -oatmeal--same as flakes, but parboiled -instant oatmeal--more processed than reg. oatmeal -oat flour--milled into dust, for baked goods or as a thickening agent. This product fits into the first catagory. Their claim of ""guaranteed uniformity"" is a coined phrase, meaning each cracked grain is the same size, a gourmet characteristic. All this being said, I am not aware of oats from Scotland or Ireland having any magical or mystical quality, outside of marketing hype or myth. Truth be told, you could go to any health food store with a bulk bin (one sign of a conscientious health food store), buy whole oats, certified organic, for about $2 per lb., and crack your own oats with a grain mill (Corona brand, one time investment, about $70, lifetime expectancy), or in a blender. For those more ambitious, you could cook them whole, which involves soaking them overnight, then simmering for about 90 minutes. Do not be put off by the cooking time, it is unattended, with a flame deflector. Cooking becomes a chore because of prep time, not the time on the stove. Why whole? Because any time you grind or crack a grain, there is nutrient loss and, to those open to more estoteric models, a loss of life force (a.k.a. ""chi""). I did buy this product, and as connoisseur of oats, I was not impressed, did not give the same energy boost as others. Did not taste fresh, either. Now, onto an advanced concept: if you truly want the ""Rolls Royce"" of oats, there is a brand called ""Really Raw Oats"". Why is this? Because the oats commercially available are partially steamed to protect against rancidity (oats are about 10% fat, albeit an exceptionally healthful fat). How do I know this? Because a truly raw grain will sprout. Attempts to sprout other oats have been fruitless. The Really Raw Oats carry a price tag of about $11 per lb., but are worth it. Conversely, the product here, in my opinion, does not command the price point it seeks. p.s. the best TASTING oats I had came out of Canada--when you dry-roasted them in a pan, it took on the aroma of vanilla--BLISS! Haven't seen them, however, since the mid 1990's. I purchased from Lynn Paterson, who was pictured in David Sergel's fine book, ""Zen Shiatsu"" Bon Appeite, Good Health and Caveat Emptor -Andrew …",29 out of 37 users found this review helpful

" Not the greatest, but not the worst either.",3,"I drink espresso (moka) daily, and go through a 250g/8.8oz brick in about 2 weeks. In my opinion, this isn't the greatest blend from Lavazza that I've had, but it's not the worst coffee I've had either (it definitely beats the drip coffee I'd otherwise get at work). It's a 70/30 robusta/arabica blend, a dark roast with a fruity though noticeably bitter finish (but not as bad as Starbucks or Peet's coffee). The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee. I'd really give it a 2.5 or 3 but then again, all taste is subjective, That being said, this is a reasonable coffee (considering taste vs. price), but I'll probably switch back to my regular (and unfortunately more expensive) blend. …",16 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Truly great coffee,5,The Keurig system is marvelous--and the Dark Magic coffee is delicious.

 Perfect for my Mother-in-Law,5,"I bought these for my mother-in-law's birthday, and they were a hit! I hate how all the other online flower sites have a huge processing fee that is almost equal to the cost of the arrangement, so I was ready to try ordering from somewhere else. I ordered these cut purple orchids on April 12th, and they shipped from Florida that day. My MIL received them in Oklahoma on the 14th, and they were in beautiful condition. The flowers shipped with individual tubes for each stem, so they were kept very fresh. Also, when I stopped by my in-law's house for Easter more than a week later, the orchids still looked fabulous! I will definitely order from this seller again if they keep their prices competitive. Spending about $30 total is great for quality orchids! …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Truly Disappointing. Product Changed. Not for the better!,1,"We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible! Deserves 0 Stars... Update - a note from Caribou Corporate: Thank you for taking the time to contact us. We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band. The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans. We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you. Sincerely, Linda Caribou Coffee Customer Relations The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change. Oh, well.

" Delicious and fresh but, caution is advised...",5,"Firstly, google the health benefits of fungreek [they are numerous]. Secondly, fenugreek is one of those spices that you cannot deal with like other spices. These little seeds are hard as rocks and unless you want to ruin your spice-grinder, I'd highly recommend you follow my procedure for using fenugreek: Well, to begin, fenugreek is actually a legume (so, if you are prone to gastro problems with beans and legumes then you might want to take a beano or equivalent supplement before ingesting fenugreek). If you want the benefits of raw fenugreek seeds. Put 1/4 cup of fenugreek seeds in a 2 cup or so capacity container and add 1/2 cup boiling water and let steep for an hour, place steeped fenugreek covered in fridge overnight and you will have some lovely, slightly chewy, less bitter fenugreek that you can add to soups and stews or eaten by the spoonful as a health supplement. One thing you will notice, is, when you add hot water to fenugreek, they will not only soften, but, they will sprout out little tail-buds which makes them sort of mid-sprout and highly digestible. If you want to fully sprout fenugreek, you can google for many techniques. If you only want to sprout this fenugreek, I'd say this is highly sproutable since even adding boiling water to the seeds did not stop them from sprouting little sprout ends. Warning: If you 'toast' fenugreek it will stink up your house to high hell and it takes days and days to get the odor out of your house and if you are planning on selling your home, you do NOT want to toast fenugreek! Anyway, my husband hates fenugreek and I love it with a passion. I think fenugreek is one of those love or hate spices. In closing, this fenugreek is very high quality, fresh and definitely sproutable! Happy fenugreeking! lol …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Don't buy this low-grade marzipan,1,"I ordered this marzipan last Christmas, amazed by the great deal that I had found. Unfortunately, the old addage is true: you get what you pay for. This marzipan is made with corn syrup instead of sugar, so it doesn't have the same texture. Even more interesting is that I froze the unused marzipan in the same bag with a 'better' variety. Within three months this marzipan had taken on a freezer taste, whereas the higher grade marzipan still tastes great even one year later. They were both in the same bag together, so it can only be the ingredients themselves that didn't hold up. This may be fine for gourmands, but a more refined palate is going to recognize the difference right away. I am so glad that I didn't buy the ten pound block like I originally intended. It may be suitable where the marzipan doesn't take center stage, but when the marzipan flavor is important pay the extra money for a 60+% almond paste made with sugar. …",30 out of 31 users found this review helpful

 A new grain-free choice for your cats,5,"My cats have been eating Innova EVO, another grain-free food, for a while. I've noticed a great improvement in their general health but I was never really happy about the fact that their binder is potato. Nature's Variety now makes Raw Instinct, which uses tapioca as a binder instead. The kibble is square with some rough edges, which is an interesting shape. The manufacturer applies a freeze-dried meat and pre-/probiotic mixture to the kibble before it goes in the bag. My cats dig right in, and although most of their diet consists of wet and raw food, I like to feed them a tiny bit of dry to add some crunch and texture to their food.

 Superior product!,5,"I have just recently begun using VCO for nearly all of my cooking. After purchasing two books on the benefits of coconut oil, I have purchased several different brands of oil. The Nutiva Organic EVCO is by far a superior oil with a delightful flavor. The price from Superstore if you are a Prime member is the best I have found for this quality of oil. I began eating the oil mixed in about 1/2 cup of cottage cheese because I read on a forum that cottage cheese has properties which help the body assimilate the oil. Since then I have expanded to many other uses. I use the oil to sautee garlic, onions, peppers, etc for all of my soups and stir frys. I spread it on toast and add it to my corn bread. In just the first week of eating coconut oil regularly I noticed that my chronic aches in my joints and muscles subsided. My skin is smoother and blemishes began to disappear. I began using it as a topical ointment on my hands, feet and face along with knees and elbows. It is a much better skin conditioner than almost anything else I have used. I found that it also works great as a conditioner for all of my wooden cooking utensils and I rub it into my cutting boards to condition them. It is far superior to mineral oil! I have introduced the oil into my husband's diet also. He has been a Type II diabetic for about 15 years and just turned 77. He is beginning to notice positive benefits also. He particularly has noticed more mental acuity. He adds the oil to his morning cereal and spreads it on his toast and really enjoys the flavor. I am so happy to have found this wonderful Nutiva oil and appreciate its many benefits. I find it kind of addictive. I now look forward to adding the oil to more and more foods and it seems to make nearly everything, including eggs, soups, stews, casseroles, muffins and breads more delicious. I highly recommend the Nutiva brand of Organic EVCO for a huge variety of uses. To those who think it has too much coconut flavor - well, I guess you can't please everyone. Try it and decide for yourself. The health benefits are worth it! This oil has given me a new energy and improved my health so positively that I would recommend it to everyone. The only downside I can mention is the plastic container. It would be better if it were packaged in glass, but hopefully all those anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties of the oil will negate the use of a plastic container ;-) …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
" I hate coconuts, but I love this!",5,"I'm not one to write reviews, only when I love / hate the product and for one thing, I HATE coconuts. However, I first tried the passion fruit flavored Zico and thought, this doesn't taste like coconuts at all! I loved the taste and soon got addicted to how good I felt post workouts. I tried the other mango flavor, and liked it too, so thought I'd venture to the natural coconut one. To my surprise, it wasn't what I remembered coconuts tasted like, in fact, it was more refreshing than the other flavors! I love the new bottle Zico has come out with, it makes drinking and cooling Zico so much easier. The Lime and Pomberry additions are amazing! The bottles make traveling with it easier, and now, I don't have to drink in one sitting. Best time to drink a Zico though is after a hard night of partying. I don't know what it is, but after a night of drinking, I always reach for a Zico and the next morning, its as if nothing happened the night before. I'm a firm believer in the natural remedies of coconuts now, post workout, post drinking, post anything where you exert energy. I still won't eat a real coconut, but I will drink a Zico. I've tried the other brands out there and cannot stomach it, but for some reason, love Zico. …",6 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 The best crackers I have EVER eaten,5,"These crackers are AMAZING. I tried them as a free sample, topped with a small piece of brie cheese, at a Sam's Club store. I expected them to taste like any other multigrain cracker, but was blown away by how good the sample was. I immediately bought a box, and literally crave and look forward to eating them, which is not something I thought I would ever say about a cracker. Saying that they taste like corn nuts, as the previous reviewer did, might turn some people off. They're not really like corn nuts, but they have a pleasant savory non-wheat grain/seed flavor, as do corn nuts. The base is brown rice meal, which is mixed with a variety of seeds (sesame, quinoa, amaranth, flax) and tamari soy sauce powder. The soy sauce is almost imperceptible and complements the other flavors well - it gives the cracker just a slight savory flavor, not a noticeable ""soy sauce"" flavor. Other multigrain crackers, even high quality crackers, lose their flavor as they are chewed, and end up tasting bland or even doughy. These keep their flavor - a deep grainy, savory flavor. I am pretty sure they would appeal to both cracker lovers and those who like to snack on chips. These crackers are excellent topped with brie cheese, dipped in salsa, or eaten plain. The brown rice meal base means that the crackers are crunchy and hold up to liquids better than wheat crackers do. They're low sodium, gluten-free, and low calorie - you can eat 15 for 140 calories, and 15 of these makes a satisfying snack. What's not to love? I do not make a point to eat gluten-free items, but these are absolutely delicious for anyone. Just a snack idea - for 240 calories, you can eat 1 ounce of brie, and 15 crackers. Believe it or not, 1 ounce of brie can be divided among 15 crackers and each bite is satisfying. By the way, I only paid $7 or $8 for this size box at Sam's Club. I love these crackers so much and find them to be so unusual in flavor that I plan to buy boxes for several family members. They make a wonderful ""go to"" healthy snack for anyone who is trying to lose weight, gluten-free diet or not. Note - these are FULFILLED by Superstore, NOT SOLD by Superstore. The beef about the price should be taken up with the actual seller. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Please Read Before Purchasing!!!,2,"Dogs are omnivores, meaning they can survive on a vegetarian diet, but by no means will they thrive without the inclusion of animal proteins. If you are genuinely concerned about the moral implications of a dog's diet and choose to feed this to your dogs, I would STRONGLY suggest supplementing this food with free range eggs, sustainably harvested sardines, or some other source of animal protein that you deem morally acceptable. I have vegetarian friends who feed their dogs this and other formulas, and when compared to my lab, who is fed a high- protein, grain- free dog food, they almost look abused. Literally, they are all very slim and their fur is coarse and patchy, as opposed to my dog, who is muscular, with fur is as soft as cotton, and as happy as can be. If you want an all- inclusive dog food that will handle your dog's nutritional needs, this is not the dog food for you. That said, if your morals won't allow you to use a dog food with named meat products as the top ingredients (and there are organic varieties), then this may be a good option for you.

 WOW!!! Our family loves our AreoGrow Garden!!,5,"We have had our AreoGrow Garden for just over a month and we are already eating fresh herbs. We love to cook with fresh herbs, but I have never liked going out to the garden to pick them, then having to wash any little bugs off them before cooking. We tried purchasing herbs from the grocery store, but they can be a bit expensive and need to be used on a timely basis. Then one day I saw this product advertised on TV and immediately researched it online and decided to purchase it from Superstore. At the time I purchased it I also decided to get the Italian Herbs seed kit. We decided to plant the herbs we thought we would use the most from both kits, so we ended up using a few from the kit it comes with and a few from the kit we ordered. Everything germinated early with one exception, the cilantro, to this day it still has not germinated. I did finally give up on it and bought a package of seeds from the store and pushed a few seeds into the sponge a few days ago. I will update this later and let you know if they germinated. It seems from the reviews that I am not the only one with the cilantro problem. I recommend this product to everyone I know who loves to grow herbs, but would prefer not to deal with the dirt and bugs. We received the Gourmet Herb kit with our AeroGrow Garden, it contains: Italian Basil, Cilantro, Mint, Dill, Parsley, Chives and Purple Basil We purchased separately the Italian Herb kit, it contains: Mint, Basil, Savory, Parsley, Garlic Chives, Oregano, and Thyme Update: No luck with the Cilantro.

" Culinary teas bulk matcha vs. ""tea ceremony quality"" matcha",4,"I am new to matcha drinking, so was somewhat concerned re: customer comments Culinary Teas matcha being ""brown"" (i.e. a not the correct bright green color). I had only tried Starbucks Matcha (PLEASE BE ADVISED - it is very tasty, but probably because the number one ingredient on the label is sugar). Also, a pound of Starbucks Matcha (as sold on a popular auction site) costs about the same as a pound of Culinary Teas bulk Matcha)...so you are getting far less of the expensive and healthful green tea powder and more sugar (the Starbucks product is somehow micronized so it does mix into solution much easier than a less processed pure tea powder). The teaspoon on the right is Teavana (at $16 for 30 grams - thats 2 Tbsp) they said it was the highest ""tea ceremony"" quality matcha. The teaspoon on the left is the bulk (1 lb, silver bag) CT product. Photo taken without a flash and not retouched so actual colors show. CT matcha is slightly less brilliant green. I mixed exact quantities (1/2 tsp) of matcha in 8 oz of liquid with exact quantities of sweetener (a blend of xylitol and stevia that I am experimenting with). The CT matcha tastes slightly less ""green"" and slightly more bitter than the Teavana, but I did the math ( a pound of CT would cost $240 at the Teavana $16 per 30 g cost) - so I am very happy with my CT purchase. Will use the smaller container for my ""working"" supply, freeze the rest and use as needed. Am finding Matcha to be a great substitute for my ""too much coffee"" habit and prefer the less instantaneous (but prolonged) energy boost it gives - not too mention alkalizing instead of acidifying, ECGC, and possible metabolism boosting effect. PS Most Starbucks barristas do not know the Matcha powder contains sugar, so they will tell you the are not adding any. As consumers, we need to ask companies to STOP ADDING SUGAR (in whatever processed form it takes) to everything they make. …",58 out of 60 users found this review helpful
 Fantastic chips!!!,5,"I want to start out by saying that i thought at first that a bag with only 120 calories and 4 grams of fat (no saturated or trans) for every 20 chips was going to taste like ****. I must say that not only was i wrong, that this is my favorite BBQ chip on the market today. They are light and you cannot taste any fat or grease after eating them. That's because they aren't baked or fried, just popped as their name suggests. These chips are very easy to dip as well. FANTASTIC PRODUCT! …",33 out of 35 users found this review helpful

 The Most Delicious Lobsters In The World,5,"In my humble opinion, Maine lobsters taste better and have more meat than any other lobsters in the world.

 Not much different from the Angel Hair shape Tofu Shirataki,5,"I did a review for the Tofu Shirataki Noodles Angel Hair shape and so this will seem repetitive if you read that review. For those who have read my other review, the only difference is the noodles are wider and seem as if it has a harder texture; but in actuality it just appears that way because the noodles are wider. The first time I heard about Shirataki noodles was years ago and I decided I would try it. I went to Fiesta and got the Tofu Shirataki Noodle both the pasta and the fettuccine shape. Shirataki are made from Konjac yams and the added tofu gives it a harder texture. The noodles without tofu added is 0 calories. The first time I ever made Shirataki Noodles I cooked it like regular pasta (the spaghetti shaped) and it turned into a gel--this was years ago. I learned that was the worst mistake to make and changed how I made these noodles. The next time I made it correctly and tried to eat it with pasta sauce. That didn't work for me, since the flavors did not merry and I was accustomed to the hard texture of pasta. When I tried the Fettuccine Shaped Shirataki the first thing that came to my mind was Lo Mein. When I made the Fettucini Shaped Noodles with Soy Sauce, some ginger, and stir fry veggies, I realized that these noodles are better with asian style recipes. Always remember to rinse this product first. To me this noodle has no flavor, it takes on the flavor of what you cook it with. Be sure not to overcook it and you will be fine. I personally do not cook it longer than 3 minutes. Update: I did some more research on Shirataki noodles in order to expand my ideas with recipes. I found that the reason that my shirataki noodles may have turned into mush was because it expired. It seems Shirataki noodles is still good for a year and even after it is still edible however it would turn to mush if cooked too long. These noodles also apparently shrink and become thinner, something it seems some people like. I went to the store where I used to get my Tofu Shirataki noodles, and looked for an expiration date. Lo and behold, it was expired by over a year. I even saw some in the store expired by over 2 years. It seems that non expired shirataki noodles will become alot more chewy if cooked too long. My mom used it in stir fry, and I have also tried it baked which is also a great idea. I have been lazy and just use any boullion cube with the noodles and that works fine...I just let it sit in the seasoning for a few hours to take the flavor of the soup. An additional update: I found out that the government allows a company to list a product as 0 calories if it has 4 or less calories. On the bag it will say 0 calories for half a bag. The entire bag could be anywhere from 8 calories or less. I researched this after seeing a pickle at 0 calories for 2/3 a pickle and seeing an entire pickle for 5 calories. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 Money saver!!,5,"As a huge fan of Keurig brewing, I was delighted to discover Solofill cups! I have been using mine for a couple months and love the versatility and the ease of using this Kcup replacement. Unlike the ""My Kcup"" holder that you can use with most Keurig machines, this little gem pops right in without having to remove the pod holder from the brewer. The Solofill takes about 2 tablespoons of coffee and that's the main appeal of this. You can use your own ground coffee instead of always having to buy the pricey pre-filled Kcups. It makes a great cup of coffee and allows users to buy any kind of coffee they please. Some users have complained about cleaning the Solofill. I find it easy. Just tap the cooled coffee grounds on the edge of your trash receptacle and most will fall out. Then rinse it out and it's ready to go again. I keep two handy so I can be using one and cleaning the other. I see this little invention as a great way to save money and have options as to the kinds and types of coffee you want to use. …",538 out of 544 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 No cat will go near it.,1,"I purchased this food after reading the many positive revieves for my 6 pound Exotic who loves to eat, especially chicken.

I tried again a few weeks later with the same results. I then decided to let a neighbor try it since I did not want it to go to waste. His cat had the same results. No deal. He then put some out for four ferral cats he was feeding . NO takers. It is hard to believe that not one of seven cats would refuse something hailed as so tempting unless the food was defective..

Most importantly, my two-year-old daughter (who is so picky she hardly eats anything) absolutely LOVES these chips. These chips are technically ""multigrain"" because they contain yellow corn, brown rice flour, flax seeds, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and soy flour. However, stone ground yellow corn is clearly the main ingredient in these chips and you'll have a hard time picking up the flavor of the other ingredients with your taste buds. The other thing I really like about these chips is that they're flavored with sea salt, which is lower in sodium and (in my opinion) tastes better than regular table salt.

 Super food - ultimate protein - body building - for food sensitivities,5,"I am lactose intolerant. Eggs give me crazy gas. I don't eat meat. Nuts give me gas. Beans give me gas. I also body build. That leaves me with little options for protein. Luckily there is hemp, and this is the part of the plant my body needs most. As stated in the product description hemp is the plant kingdoms gold standard, much like eggs are the gold standard in the animal kingdom. And really the two are very comparable. Hemp is much cheaper though. It dissolves very easy in water, unlike egg protein. It is easy to digest, unlike egg protein. It tastes great, and is quite mild, almost nutty flavor -egg protein always tastes like **** because they always put artificial flavors in, which make no doubt about it, are chemicals that are bad for your body. The hemp + fiber variety Nutiva makes is too gritty for me. This 50% protein is more expensive because more of the fiber is sifted out. Being a vegetarian I get plenty of fiber as it is anyway. I eat probably 6 heaping scoops (like a standard protein extract measuring cup) of this stuff a day, and never get sick of it. It's great between meals, or with meals, or mixed into meals, and you can mix it into almost anything because of the quite neutral flavor. I recover from workouts faster. It never gives me gas or makes me feel bloated. It has little fat, and the small amount of beneficial healthy fats it does have are needed to build muscle.

" Excellent brew, economical too!",5,"With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time. Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?). I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig. It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well. I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags. This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup). Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here. Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like. Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there. Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder. Ok, on to the the ekobrew. They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing. The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds. Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew. I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill. I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter. Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper. I'll be looking into getting another one of these! …",44 out of 45 users found this review helpful
 Not as good as I expected,3,"This buckwheat is very flavorful while uncooked. However, it is dried/roasted in such way that if you cook it the standard way you will end up with mush.

I am used to the kind of buckwheat that you can cook in a rice steamer and it does not turn to mush. I know in non-organic world there are better products.

 Excellant product - good price,5,Now makes an excellant product and Superstore provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery. The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet. 1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste. Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later. I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation. …,26 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 FYI- BEFORE YOU BUY Miracle Noodles PLEASE READ THIS!,1,"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: &lt;...>. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ ""Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all! What's that tell you??? …",9 out of 15 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 This filter works PERFECT!,5,"Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the ""old fashion way"" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size. I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Superstore, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry. The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I.

 Love these!!!,5,"When I bought these online I was hoping they would be delicious. I got them in and immediatly made hot dogs for the family. With these buns I found they needed to be microwaved to really get a hot dog bun taste to them. However, what I found to be even better is that with the size they looked more like hoagies to me, so of course I had to make hoagies and steak and cheese sandwiches with these!!! I made the steak and cheese, then I put the sandwich together and into the oven. OMG!!! I will never buy anything else again!! I know some people just want hot dog buns, but I found a better use for them. My kids still love to have their hot dogs on these buns, but I prefer them for steak and cheese. I am happy and the kids are happy. Some people complain because these are not precut, ummm, so what!?! if you have a knife you can split them the way you want:) these are also great for making pizza.

 The easiest way to make ice cream,5,"I love my ice cream maker, but tired of the lengthy prep to make the ice cream base. This stuff solves the problem in a couple of important ways. For one thing, it couldn't be easier to use. For my 1-quart ice cream maker, I mix a package of this stuff with 1 3/4 cup of 2% milk and 1/4 cup of cream with a stick blender right in my ice cream maker's bucket. That takes about 1 minute and I'm ready to start up the ice cream maker. The ice cream is delicious and the results consistent each and every time. Because I use mostly 2% milk, my end product is low-cal compared to most recipes and virtually dietetic compared to store bought, but it is still delicious and has good consistency. There are no off-putting ingredients in this mix, which I value highly. I can still get special flavors of ice cream by decreasing the milk and adding, say, fresh peaches, or cherries or strawberries. I zap them up right in with the mix and milk with the stick blender. No mess, fast and really good. Because the process is so easy and satisfying, we have ice cream a lot and really get full value from our ice cream maker and since the ice cream is lower calorie and lower fat than other kinds, I don't feel guilty about this pleasure. Very highly recommended. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Perfect Pancakes,5,"I simply love Bob's Red mill products, and love Superstore for selling them for quite a bit less than Whole Paycheck. I've been enjoying a lot of things from them recently, including Kamut Breakfast Cereal and a really delicious soup mix. Their Buckwheat Pancake mix is another example of a healthy, tasty, and reasonably priced item from Bob's Red Mill. I got a taste for Buckwheat pancakes as a kid (My mom used to make them on cold mornings in January), but stopped eating them as an adult. My wife LOVES pancakes, and while I enjoy them too, I find the regular kind not keep me filled up, nor are they particularly healthy. I remembered that I used to really like buckwheat pancakes, and decided to hunt some up. I found these, and have been enjoying them ever since. The mix is easy to prepare, but this isn't a 'complete' mix and does require an egg and some oil in addition to cold water. As an alternative you can use milk, which gives the pancakes a slightly richer flavor. Milk or water, either way they're tasty! Buckwheat is a wholegrain, meaning these fill you up and keep you filled much longer than traditional pancakes which are full of sugar and cheap carbs. I can eat probably a dozen regular pancakes. I can only manage to put away 5-6 of these guys! A few recommendations on preparation: 1) Mix the pancake batter and then let it sit 30 minutes or even an hour in your refrigerator. It makes the pancakes lighter and fluffier. 2) Go for thinner batter rather than thick. It makes the pancakes easier to cook, and gives you a tastier pancake as a result. 3) Cook on medium heat, not high. Because the batter is dark to begin with, it is harder to tell when your pancakes are done without overcooking them. Use less heat to help you get them cooked perfectly. 4) You can easily mix this batter with a regular pancake mix to make 'hybrid' cakes if you find these are a bit too thick for your taste. I've gone that route a few times for my wife since she likes her pancakes less dense than these. 5) Get yourself some real maple syrup! Nothing goes as well with Buckwheat pancakes than real maple syrup! That's how the American pioneers ate them, and I love feeling like I'm participating in an American tradition when I make these for my family. 6) Eat them for dinner! Pancakes and eggs for dinner is amazing. You can't go wrong with these pancakes. Buy them. Cook them. Eat them. Repeat! …",23 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 A Good Cup of Coffee,4,"This is a nice, somewhat mellow but rich cup of coffee. I like the packaging because I have had more than a few normal K-cups either explode or backfire in my Keurig. With this type of cup, the water has no place to go but out through the filter. It's pure genius if you ask me. I do prefer the Rainforest Blend to the Fogchaser from the San Francisco Bay Coffee Company. I found the Fogchaser much more acidic and, though it could be a coincidence, my heart rate went to about 120 after 2 cups of Fogchaser. Of interest, the pack of 3 I received did not come in boxes with any descriptions on them. They were just 3 thickish cellophane bags with 12 cups in each, which I thought was strange because when I ordered the Fogchaser, each pack of 12 was in a box and I was able to give one as a gift to my coffee buddy at work. As for the coffee getting stale as others are concerned about, well.....coffee doesn't last very long around here. 12 cups goes in much less than a week and I have not noticed any staleness by storing these in my upright Keurig carousel. That's probably because this particular carousel does not leave the bottoms of the cups exposed to air. I digress. I do recommend the Rainforest Blend -- it's a great cup of coffee at a really good price. And less packaging to boot. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful
" Our favorite extra-bold K-cup--dark, rich, full-bodied",5,"Jet Fuel is our favorite of the Coffee People ""extra-bold trilogy""--Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, and Black Tiger. It's dark, sweet, and rich, with a fuller body than Wake Up Call or Black Tiger. It has a clean finish and notes of chocolate and honey. We also love the new packaging. Since K-cups are nitrogen-packed, the coffee doesn't go stale, so the last cup is as good as the first. If there are a couple of dark-roast lovers in your family, a box of 50 will be slurped down in no time. And I have to say that, even though we store them in the back of a dark cabinet, the box graphics are a nice touch. It probably cost them a fraction of a fraction of a cent to make it a little more attractive, and I appreciate that! When you first got your Keurig brewer, you drank through the sampler coffees... and if you asked yourself, ""Is that as dark as it gets??"" then I think you'll go for Jet Fuel or one of the other Coffee People EBs.

(But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)! I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in about six different flavors and each one is yummy! You also get a good mix of colors and flavors. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a ""chocolate-type candy"" where you'd have to worry about allergies. They arrived at my home fresh and delicious. To keep them this way, I put them in two ""Freezer Bags"" and of course, I kept some out. Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some and that's OK. I bought this HUGE five pound bag! Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price for this is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound! And these are the same exact bears, but you don't have to worry if everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag!

 Bad for your health!,1,"Equal and NutraSweet were the exact same product, with the same exact ingredient, made by the exact same company. Consumer Reports blew that cover a few years ago. The funny thing was that you could find both on grocery store shelves right next to each other, see the same company name on both boxes, read the same ingredient, same amount per packet, same amount of packets per box, yet they charged double the money for Equal than they did for NutraSweet, and even Consumer Reports never got an answer from the company as to WHY that was. Since then, the company that produces Aspartame is no longer ""Searle"" (then headed by CEO Donald Rumsfeld!) but instead Monsanto, the same company that produced the toxic ""agent orange"" for Vietnam! If you are looking for a substitute natural sweetener, because you are a diabetic, then STEVIA should be something to look into. Oh, but the FDA does not allow it to be called a ""sweetener"" it has to be labeled a ""nutritional suppliment"" by law so that it can not compete with big money contributers Aspartame (equal) and Sucralose (splenda) and Acesulfame-K so although Stevia is safe and has been used for thousands of years in other countries (even was in Diet Coke in Japan) the only problem the FDA has, is that it can not be called a sweetener!

" Very tasty, but not healthy or nutritious",4,"Think of this as a candy/snack bar rather than a granola bar and you will not be disappointed. It's very sweet and tasty, but there's little or no nutritional value in here, despite being made from oats. The product is heavily processed and definitely what anyone would call healthy. Made with natural and artificial flavors, the ingredients list is very long (see bottom of review). It's loaded with sugar and not something you want to give yourself or your kids on a regular basis. Note how many times sugar or its variants appear in the list (glucose, fructose). Each bar is 1.23 oz. Daily value: Fiber 1g (5%), Vitamin A (0%), Vitamin C (0%), Calcium (10%), Iron (2%). 150 calories per bar (40 from fat), 11g of sugar. I'm giving the product 4 stars based on taste and texture.

 Beware of Soy Lecithin!,1,I was going to purchase this until I saw that it has Soy Lecithin in it. Soy is estrogenic and Soy Lecithin in particular is like the **** they scrape off the floor. They pump it into everything and is NOT good for you. Why is it so hard to find food without this **** in it? Especially in food that is supposed to be good for you because it is organic! …,2 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 A snack for everyone in the family,5,"Bought it for a gift. Arrived in perfect condition and made a great presentation. There was something in the basket for everyone in the family. Products were all the favorite snacks like nuts, cookies, taffy, summer sausage but much more intriguing - the basket was opened immediately so everyone could try a Malt Shop Taffy (chocolate shake, rootbeer float and cherry cola!). The all natural nuts were fresh and crunchy and the sausage was delicious on its own but even better with the mustard that accompanied it. *I ordered this basket when my wife gave me the task of buying a present for a party. In my quick perusal of Superstore, I felt I completed my assignment perfectly. My wife, of course, checked up on my order and was horrified to see I ordered something that received some 1 star reviews. The days were looooong until the package showed up and I was accused, more than once, of not being detail oriented enough. Thankfully I was absolutely vindicated when the basket arrived. After reading the other reviewers (and reading what ""vine"" was) clearly there was a mix up with the baskets sent to that program - that seems to happen early so they are the first reviews - which unfortunately caused me agita (why I am even taking the time to write this). I hope no one else will be confused by this very strange situation. And no, if I realized I would have been in the dog house for the shipping period, I wouldn't have picked this item -- however, for the record, I was right. …",7 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Frustrated and feeling duped,1,"Our original order (placed on Superstore , from Vitamin Grocer) of two biokleen produce wash bottles came completely wrecked (sad, because it is a really great product) - since there was no protective packaging in the box, both bottles arrived cracked an spilled. My husband received an email at his agency from the staff at our APO post office to pick up the leaking box - the box itself was not damaged, only the contents, since I'm sure they tumbled around quite a bit without anything to protect them (which makes no sense to send bottles containing liquid). Since we have been using our APO, we have spent thousands of dollars and received many many dozen packages with absolutely no problems. After writing initial review, I was contacted by the seller, Vitamin Grocer. Promised if I deleted my review, they would send a replacement for our order (plus additional bottles - I declined the additional bottles, but agreed graciously to the replacements as long as they were better packaged, because what would be the point?), they wrote me back that replacements would be sent ASAP - that contact was originally November 4. I contacted them again around January 4 to follow up, received an email stating it was sent, and I then followed up requesting tracking and they have not responded. I am disappointed and frustrated and feel duped. …",4 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Diet Lemon Lime- flavor,4,"I have tried this flavor and it tastes a lot like Sprite. I like that it has no aspartame. The price on Superstore is Double what you can get these syrups for elsewhere, so I will not buy it here. …",38 out of 42 users found this review helpful

 Not GRAIN FREE,1,"At the risk of sounding repetitive I too bought this under the assumption that it was blanched almond meal. I read the product description before buying this product and it did not contain any information about other ingredients besides almond or I would not have ordered it. I am sure if you are looking for something that is simply gluten free that this is a lovely product, but if you like me are trying to avoid all grains this is not for you. Also I am a little annoyed that now I can not return it because it is a grocery item. …",10 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Really good.,5,"This coconut water is much better than the Brazilian sourced coconut waters such as Zico. The Thai sourced coconut water is sweeter and and the flavor is more interesting, but there is no added sugar like you find in a lot of coconut ""juices"". I really enjoy the pulp bits, gives you a little coconut to chew on, just like a fresh coconut would. I could see how some people wouldn't like this though, so if unsure you may want to get the pulp-free water. The prices are great on Superstore if you get a subscription, as the 9.5 ounce bottles are $2 pretty much everywhere in NYC, so for the same price you get a lot more in these cans. Only down side is that they are so good that you go through them really fast, we can't keep them around more than 3 days before they are all gone! At least it's better than a diet coke addiction. …",55 out of 59 users found this review helpful

 Awesome discovery,5,"Just discovered this black salt and now a big fan. While it does leak the color, the taste is worth it. I rub it on pats of ice cold butter that I serve with good bread. Everyone makes a comment about the stunning contrast and once they taste it on the bread with the butter - they become hooked. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Really increases supply but makes my baby cry,2,"When I returned to work my supply really went down. I was afraid I would not be able to continue breastfeeding. Just one cup of tea a day has increased my supply so much that I have to wear nursing pads again! However, my baby does not like this tea. Whenever I nurse her after drinking this tea she screams like she is in severe pain. I don't want her to hurt, so I have discontinued use of this tea. …",8 out of 12 users found this review helpful
