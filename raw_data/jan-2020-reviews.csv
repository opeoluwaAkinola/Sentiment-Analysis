" These are awesome, fatty, and flavorful.",4,"These little pretzel pieces are totally addictive, which is probably not a good thing because they're a lot worse for you than you'd think pretzels should be. They have around 60 fat calories and 3 grams of saturated fat in ONE ounce, which equals out to be 15% of your daily sat fat intake per serving (one ounce). The reason they're so good AND so fatty is that the mustard/onion seasoning is in an oil that permeates through the shell of the pretzel, making them extra flavorful and not dry at all. They're a little sweet, have good mustard flavor, and the onion flavor even comes through a little (they taste like they're supposed to). I try to just grab a handful at snack time and quit while I'm ahead, but I usually end up going back for more later. If you're willing to put up with a little extra fat for a lot of extra flavor, these are a perfect snack. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 No Longer American Candy,1,This company used to be in Georgia. A few years ago a larger company bought them out- closed the factory and they are now made in Mexico. They are not as good as they used to be and they are no longer even made here. Every Candy Cane I have found so far is made either in Mexico or China. Terrific- we don't even make our own Candy Canes anymore. I am not buying lousy Candy Canes made in Mexico or China. …,8 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me",5,"I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store. I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie. In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion. Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me. This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber. While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar. Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

" Really energizes, tastes great",5,"I'm a green tea fanatic, and have tried over 150 bagged/loose leaf varieties. I have a crazy job, and used to rely on coffee for the energy boost while sleep deprived. Coffee works, but at the cost of digestive issues, acidity and a dehydrated ""run-down"", stressed out feeling. Enter green tea, which energizes and rejuvenates in a completely different way form coffee. Green tea's antioxidants, small amounts of caffeine and theanines promote a feeling of relaxation as well as stamina, and you can drink several cups without feeling stressed out and jittery (ie the over-caffeinated syndrome from coffee). While bagged tea will never equate the taste and freshness standard of looseleaf, if you are looking for a convenient tea offering a true energy boost to take at work, this tea is fantastic. The triphala extract (an Ayurvedic herb blend known for promoting regularity, energy and well-being) really does seem to rev up your metabolism and digestion while sustaining a level of peaceful energy. I was very pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality of this tea - it's got a faint blueberry 'zing' to it and doesn't taste medicinal at all. In fact, I subscribed to have this item delivered to me regularly as I went through so many boxes quickly. It's a great price and the little peaceful sayings on each green tea bag help remind you to stay centered and happy with each sip! …",35 out of 36 users found this review helpful

 Great baby food maker!,5,"The Baby Brezza is a super easy to use baby food maker. You can literally throw in the ingredients and within 15-25 minutes, you have homemade baby food. My only complaint is that being a mother of twins, the baby food maker does not have the capacity that I would like since I have two babies who eat a ton. (My workaround is making multiple batches of the same thing and/or similar mixtures which seems to work.) My suggestion for Baby Brezza is to add a ""Blend time"" button.

My girlfriend, who also eats healthy, seems to only taste one ingredient in this - the Sorghum, and doesn't like it at all.

 A fine chocolate for mixing coffee beverages,4,"I'm afraid that many of the negative reviews about this product rather miss the point. They even state on the Tassimo website that these discs are best used with the addition of marshmallows or milk, but even without this information, most people would be able to figure it out for themselves. The Suchard disc contains chocolate syrup. It has no milk, no cream, and no non-dairy creamer. When most people think of ""hot chocolate,"" they think of a drink that's made with milk, no? Just like a latte or a cappucino requires the addition of milk. Yet for some reason the same people who think nothing of adding milk to make a cappucino can't figure out that they need to do the same to make hot chocolate. Baffling. Use of the Suchard disc without the addition of milk or cream (either the Tassimo milk discs or regular milk) will have the same result as diluting Hershey's syrup with water. Expecting it to taste anything like Swiss Miss or similar packaged cocoas containing powdered milk is unrealistic and unfair. This product is even better used with powdered milk or non-dairy creamer, as it has a richer flavor due to less dilution that way. …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 This is what works.  It's all about placement,5,"I have a large yard with several moles. I called a mole/pest removal company. I hired them and paid 200.00 to have about a dozen traps set (yes, they used these exact traps which is why I ordered some for myself). Anyway, they had 30 days to trap moles in my yard. They also charged 69.00 for each mole they caught. They got 5 moles in that time. That may not seem like many, but if you read about moles, you'll find out they are not like mice or rats. They breed slowly and live alone. They reproduce once per year and maybe have 2-4 offspring of which maybe half will live in natural conditions. When you see an area or network of mole tunnels (your grass pushed up), that's just one mole... If you study the tunnels, you'll usually see it comes in from the edge of your yard where there may be more moisture (forest or wild area). You just need to look at the branching of the tunnels and find a few areas where you can guess the mole may be re-using that section to go back and forth. Once you locate a good spot, gently push the grass down to collapse the tunnel, and set the trap. Be sure to set the trap so the spikes that go in the ground (not the spikes that kill the mole) are not right in the middle of the mole tunnel. The idea (obviously) is to set the trap in an area the mole will try to use again. When the mole tries to fix the tunnel, bam! I just trapped my first mole today. I saw the spring of the trap was down, took the trap up, and the mole was dead underneath. This trap does work to kill the mole. YOu just need to put it in the right place and set it correctly. The guy who worked for the pest control company told me most of this and it really makes a difference. I'm here to buy a few more traps. I would suggest getting two traps for each distinct area you think there may be a mole. I plan to just keep rotating 4-6 traps until all the moles are gone. …",41 out of 41 users found this review helpful
 Australia's healthiest export,5,"Vegemite 400g Jar is practically unknown in North America, but I'll bet there is no one is Australia of an ethnicity who has never heard of Vegemite, and of those who have, almost everyone will have some at home. Every restaurant and side of the road eatery carries it. It comes in tubes, jars, and little packets like jams and butter substitutes do in the US. It is Vegemite, the concentrated yeast extract spread that goes on most slices of bread or toast Down Under. Dark brown to be almost black, it has a strong taste, so if you're a novice, spread it thin. Americans who try Vegemite fall into two categories: those who hate it or love it immediately. Don't take my word for it, check it out online: there is no better sourse for B vitamins than Vegemite. If your are used to nothing other than peanut butter and jam on your bread and toast, you are ready for a change, a change for a low-calorie healthy product that you won't be able to stop talking about. It's flavour is unique; it's closest cousin is the British and New Zealand Marmite, though similar, is not the same.

 GREAT Taste!,5,"Have never been a big meat-eater, but cut back even more a few months ago. I began supplementing my diet with more beans/legumes, but was not feeling nutritionally satisfied, and realized I was not getting enough protein. Did a little research, and discovered that hemp was ideal for meeting protein requirements, and according several articles I read, it has many other nutritional and health benefits as well. I purchased the Nutiva hemp protein powder in conjunction with the Better Than Milk ""Rice"" (to avoid over use of soy). According to directions for both products, I mix 4 tablespoons hemp protein and 2 tablespoons of BTM, in water. It mixes easily in a regular plastic shaker, and I don't even have to use the ""de-clumping"" attachment that fits inside the shaker. It's just Shake-N-Go! This combination has been the perfect way to start my day. I was concerned about the taste, as some reviews I have read rated the taste of hemp very low. I can't speak for other brands, but the finely ground Nutiva hemp powder has a mild nutty flavor, and I LOVE IT. From what I've read, hemp does not contain oligosaccharides (which commonly causes ""gastric distress"" with soy proteins), and I have not experienced any bloating with the hemp and rice milk combo. I am happy to start my day with something both nutritious and delicious, and thank goodness I don't have to use the electric blender (one less thing to wash). Also, the Superstore price on the Nutiva Hemp Protein and the Better Than Milk Rice can't be beat, and both qualify for free shipping. FANTASTIC!!! …",96 out of 99 users found this review helpful

 Makes Life Easy and Bellies Happy!,5,"I started using this when my son was 6 months old and have loved it from the first day. I truly wish this was around when I had my first! It is so easy and I didn't feel like I was making separate food for my baby, but rather making him a part of what we were eating. The all-in-one is so perfect. Before I had to steam everything separately then transport into a blender or mixer (which are not designed to puree effectively) and then move again to jars/bowls/storage. Ugh..I felt like a short order cook. With the Baby Brezza, it was simple steps to great food. I also found that I used it for the rest of the family to make berry sauce for oatmeal, yogurt, pancakes, chicken and pork, homemade applesauce in a snap, great guacamole for the whole family and so much more. So if your fear is that ""this will just be another gadget in your cupboard"" after the baby becomes a toddler, don't worry.

 VARIETY PACKS - THINGS TO KNOW,5,"While variety packs sound like a good idea, you should be aware that there is a reason you usually aren't told exactly what's in it. It's because almost always, the vendor throws in a bunch of flavors, blends, teas, and decafs that are not usually what you want. It can be a waste of money for most. A much better solution, besides sampling a friends K-cup favorites, is to go onto the Keurig site ( ) and buy their low cost 5 packs. They usually cost under $3 and give you enough coffee to help decide what you might like. Plus, you'll know exactly what's in the smapler before you buy it.

 My dog is obsessed with this ball,5,"I went on Superstore looking for some type of dog chew or hard food that would take a long time for my dog to get through, but not so hard that she would give up. She's about 25 pounds, active, but won't play with any toys, and can get down a rawhide in ten minutes. I wanted to find something to cut into her boredom and downtime, but not add a lot of calories. The first day I put it together (took about one minute) and rolled it across the floor. She slowly took after it, investigated, and I went to make dinner. I enjoyed my first dinner at home in about a year that didn't involve my dog staring at me hoping for a handout. She just obsessed over the ball, licking it, and grinding at it with her teeth. After dinner I checked it, and she had made what appeared to be almost negligible progress on the treat. We watched a movie in peace (other than this constant weird panting/slurping noise from the other room). At some point, we realized she had been working on this thing for about three hours. My wife checked her mouth, she was afraid her gums would be bleeding or that her teeth would be ground down to the gums. But no sign of damage. We took it away from her and put it on top of the fridge, and she sat there staring up at the fridge for about half an hour. I'm now on my third day, about three hours a day, still working on the first two discs that fit on opposite sides of the ball. I think maybe she's gotten through about half of it. She's actually penetrated one of the discs with a hole that goes all the way through. She's obsessed. While she has it, she doesn't want to do anything else. If I go to pet her (which she normally loves) she treats me as an irritant keeping her from her ball. Want to walk (normally her favorite thing)? Nope. Maybe after I'm done with this ball in another 16 hours I'll walk. I wonder how long she would be on this ball if I let her? Her jaws must be cramping up. I get the feeling I could give it to her, go to bed, and wake up to see her with bloodshot eyes still working on the ball. It's like crystal meth for dogs. Oh my god, while I'm writing this my dog accidentally rolled the ball under a table and she can't get to it. She looks like an alcoholic staring at a drink they can't reach. I actually feel sorry for her. It's almost 9pm and she's been on this thing since 6pm. Anyway, for my dog, this was exactly what I was looking for. I give it 5 stars. …",24 out of 24 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 15 users found this review helpful
" Its costly through this vendor, reached me melted and poor service",1,"The service for return was poor. The product reached me melted and fully bloomed (chocolate was white with spots and streaks on the surface). Though this is something that can be reused by melting, not for the seeding for which I'd needed this. They were not agreeing for return for a product that reached me in a form that was not acceptable. I had to explain my need and purpose.

Not because I didn't get my money's worth, but because it was so good. I usually have Oatmeal about 3 times a week, and have always been real loyal to Quaker Oats(not the instant), but I gave these a try and it is now my new favorite, and I have them almost every day now.. Following the cooking directions(this was my first time with a quick cook oatmeal),and cooking just a few minutes(add the oats and cold water together, boil and stir for 3-5 minutes), the oatmeal came out perfect for me the first time, and does every time. With the suggested 1/2 cup Irish Oatmeal to 1 Cup Water, the consistency, for me was perfect. Just a little creamy, and not too soggy. The taste was the big test though, and I loved it. I am cutting out sugar whenever I can, but my Quaker was still one place I used just a little, so I just tried a little non-fat soy milk on the McCann's, and occasionally a spritz of a butter flavored cooking spray(just to have a little variety everyday), and I didn't even miss the sugar at all. Of course, you can experiment by adding a little more oats if you like it a little thicker, or more water for a thinner consistency. Honey, raisins or other fruit go great with it too.There are also instructions for micro-wave use. If you are a die-hard Quaker fan, and don't want to just dive right in and buy a 6 pack, you can find this brand at the Trader Joe's stores. I also saw the ""McCann's Steel Cut Oats"" there as well, which I haven't tried yet. There is no sodium, sugars, or cholesterol. It's low fat and calorie(2gm/150 per 1/2 cup dry serving). A good source of fiber and is pure and natural. Ingredients..100% Irish wholegrain oats. There are several different kinds of these oats available. Click on ""McCann's"" at top to see the other selections.This one is the ""quick cook""(not instant), has a gold trimmed box, with a creamy colored background and ""Irish Oatmeal"" on a green banner. A satisfying meal that will keep you going until lunch. Okay, so, remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy!.....Laurie …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",33 out of 48 users found this review helpful
" Good product, BPA fears no longer an issue",4,"****Latest Update**** We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free. I confirmed this with customer service. Leaving the remaining review as it was... ********************* My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12) . Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12) , (and so I posted my review there as well). I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product? As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly. ****UPDATED (old)**** Just spoke to someone from customer service. She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food. I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it. I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least. …",24 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 Best Baby Food by Far and a Great Variety,5,"Earth's Best Baby Food My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money. Antioxidant Variety Pack We've loved this variety so far. I never noticed it when my son was eating baby food, but now my daughter has one at least once a day. They tend to be a veggie heavy variety and my daughter would rather have veggies than fruit most days. The only one in the variety she can't eat so far is the Banana Mango, because of an allergy to mangos, but I'm hoping to save those for a later date when she can tolerate it better. The only thing I didn't like about this product was that when I initially was deciding to purchase it I couldn't find out what varieties were included in the pack. So for your information they are: Carrot Tomato, Sweet Potato Apricot, Apple Butternut Squash, and Banana Mango. …",79 out of 79 users found this review helpful

 Meh,3,"We got the twenty-four-piece multi-pack, which comes with four flavors: Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, Strawberry, and Sour Apple. The ingredients for the Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, and Strawberry are: ""organic apple puree, organic apple juice concentrate, organic flavor, pectin, colored with fruit and vegetable juice."" Also, some vitamins and minerals are added. Sour Apple ingredients are exactly the same, except there is no coloring added. The ""organic flavor"" ingredients are not specified, nor are the fruit and vegetable juices used for color. We can assume that these ingredients do vary among the different flavored fruit ropes, but we don't know what they are. These fruit ropes do not have the fruit taste we thought they should. Our family didn't like them very much. They aren't terrible -- we just don't think they're good enough to purchase again; but maybe that's just because we're accustomed to natural foods. The ingredients aren't bad either, but they're nothing exciting -- as far as we can tell, they're just apple (pectin comes from apples) with anonymous color and flavor enhancers (and the supplemental vitamins and minerals). Additionally, among the Tropical Twist flavored fruit ropes were several that had not been packaged properly. The ropes were sticking out the bottoms of the wrappers, having been squished along with the wrapper when the machinery pressure/heat sealed them. The reviewers who thought these were very chewy must have gotten stale ones. The fresh ones are on the softer side, but still sticky. (Braces wearers, beware.) For small, individually-wrapped dried fruit treats, I would recommend Stretch Island fruit leather instead. These contain the fruits named in their flavors (e.g. the ingredients in Stretch Island's ""orchard cherry"" fruit leather are: apple puree concentrate, cherry puree concentrate, orange puree concentrate, natural black cherry flavor) and they taste like those fruits, too, without being too sweet or tart or sticky. …",31 out of 36 users found this review helpful

 Premium Gum - Good For Your Teeth,4,"This is the best valued Orbit chewing gum package.

 Tasty popcorn that doesn't get stuck between your teeth!,5,"Okay, maybe the heading exagerates just a tad... Red Popcorn has a MUCH more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops, it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear. When it pops, it looks pretty much like any other popcorn, except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual. The meet is white, but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them. You would never know that the pretty, white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping. The flavor is great! It smelled ""toastier"" as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried. We tried it all different ways, with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good.

 My favorite tea in the whole world. Period.,5,"Now, I don't presume to say that this is a tea for everyone. I don't quite get it, but obviously, considering the reviews, many people don't like it at all. (I gave t-bags to 2 co-workers, after raving about how wonderful this is, and their lack of comment 6 weeks later tells me that they didn't like it, either.) It's up to you whether you want to risk disliking it, or missing out on something truly amazing. (Rule of thumb: If you like pu-erh, you might as well try it; if not, this might not be your best introduction to it.) When I'm having a horrible day, when things have turned sour and the world seems to be against me, this is my cup of comfort, my security blanket. It soothes me, calms me with its sheer deliciousness. (Give a child a big bar of chocolate, and he'll stop sulking in no time. That's my equivalent.) Now, this tea is amazing, but far from perfect. I wish there were twice as much tea in each bag, for starters; this is a bit weak, and I use big mugs. I wish there was more pu-erh than condiments (chocolate nibs, orange pieces) per bag. I wish that it was good for multiple re-steepings, as most pu-erhs are. A few more t-bags per box would be very nice too, or a lower price tag. In fact, these shortcomings annoy me a bit, and I've been looking for other chocolate teas (pu-erh and non-pu-erh) to substitute it. So far they've all failed. It is next to impossible to find *good* chocolate tea; most are terrible. See: I hate rooibos, so that plus chocolate equals ""eeew"". I like black tea, but haven't found a good combination yet. Green tea and chocolate sounds gross; I haven't tried it yet. Same for white and oolong. I've only found another brand of chocolate pu-erh (Mighty Leaf) but the flavor wasn't there. But I found a way to make this perfect: I cut a bag open and mix it with regular pu-erh; Tea Organic Pu-erh Tuo Cha Loose Tea, 5-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2) or a Camel's Breath tuo cha work beautifully. This way I can steep it 3-4 times, and I get the yummy flavor in a much stronger version. Heavenly!!! …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

I made them with fresh tomatoes, basil & mozzarella with a tiny bit of olive oil and it was delicious! Again, much like a cellophane noodle, they soak up whatever sauce you cook them with. They come packaged in water, and they say to rinse them then drop them in boiling water.

 Baby Brezza makes it a breeze,5,"I am not the main chef in our household. My husband enjoys cooking whereas my comfort zone is being the clean-up crew(washing dishes, storing leftovers away). Don't get me wrong, there are a few occasions where I will prepare a decent meal but for the most part, I'm normally in the background when it comes to the kitchen. With our first child, I made a feeble attempt at making my own baby food. I roasted a butternut squash in the oven, steamed a couple of vegetables then used a food processor for blending. I was excited about making my own baby food for about two weeks tops. For me, it took so much time and a lot of clean-up afterwards that I ended up purchasing ready-made baby food. With our second child, I decided I wanted another go at making baby food. Since I already (unsuccessfully)tried making food by steaming/baking and blending separately, I realized it made sense for me to purchase a baby food maker. I narrowed it down to Beaba and Baby Brezza. I chose the Baby Brezza after reading the reviews for both on Superstore. I love the Baby Brezza. Since my daughter turned 6 months, I've prepared: green beans, sweet potatoes, carrots, chicken breast, sweet peas, pears, apples, peaches and prunes. And she is 7.5 months. Yes, I know that I've only been using it for a month and a half but the point is, I have used it every four days (the recommended time for babies to be introduced to new food) and I see myself using it until she can eat food that actually looks the way it should. It's super easy to use. You chop up the food in small 1/4 cuts, pour water into the reservoir, transfer the food into the container, decide whether you want to steam only or steam + blend, select the length of steam time and press START. The clean-up is pretty easy. I let the blade soak in warm, soapy water while I clean the container. I also drain the water out of the reservoir and leave the cap on the reservoir open so as to let the inside of the reservoir air dry. It takes about a day out on our kitchen counter to be completely bone dry inside the reservoir. For people concerned about mold, if you dry your reservoir completely, you have no worries. Food occasionally sticks on the blades but I use a short small bottle brush to thoroughly get in between the blades. My only (minor) complaint would be the blending noise. My husband and I don't mind it, my 3.5 year old son doesn't mind it, but my 7.5 month daughter gets a bit spooked. But, seriously, the instrument is blending. It's doing its job. It's a strong motor that purees fruits/vegetables/meat to a homogenous consistency. I don't blame the maker but I just want to throw that out there for people that have noise-sensitive babies. *FYI, the optional items really aren't necessary. The cutting board? Really, just use your hands and scoop the vegetable/fruit/meat into the collection carafe. The spatula? I'm sure you can find a baking spatula in your utensil drawer. **FYI again, I use little BPA-free storage cubes to store the blended foods in the freezer. For me, it's a lot easier to use than ice cube trays. …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Bob's worst product,1,"I love most Bob's Red Mill products and have been buying from them for 10+ years. However, this is my least favorite of their products. This stuff is easy to cook with, it's true, but it tastes like rubber, smells bad when it's cooking, and has no flavor until you add your own spices. I have no idea why I used to cook with this stuff so often other than that I didn't know much about cooking in HS and it looked ""high protein"" on the label. I recently read The Whole Soy Story by Kaayla Daniel (Superstore has it), and was amazed to learn that processed soy products like TSP are processed at high temperatures, denaturing the proteins and leaving in loads with antinutrients that damage the thyroid among many other health problems they cause. Although TSP appears to be almost all protein (like meat or tofu), in reality, you don't absorb much of the protein, anyway. While I am glad Bob's is using organic soybeans to make their TSP (thereby leaving out the pesticides and genetically engineered ingredients), the fact that it's ""organic"" doesn't make it a healthy or even a safe product. The dangerous antinutrients in soy are not a chemical additive or pesticide, they are in intrinsic part of the beans themselves, the plant's natural way of deterring pests. Traditional foods made from soy and eaten over the past 400+ years were slow cooked and fermented, destroying the antinutrients and leaving the protein, vitamins, and minerals intact. TSP is the total opposite of whole, healthy, fermented soy products like tempeh or miso soup, as it is not fermented and leaves in all the antinutrients. As a longtime vegan on a gluten-free diet because of food allergies, I'll continue to buy other Bob's products (they have an amazing gluten-free line), but I am saddened they are still making highly-processed, extremely unhealthy items like TSP. …",13 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 Has the be the greatest soft drink EVER!,5,"Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States. To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray. The original flavor reviewed here tastes a lot like Sprite, but Ramune also comes in several other flavors. It uses high fructose corn syrup and/or cane sugar as a sweetener (It lists both on the label, which usually means that it uses whatever is cheapest on the world market at the time of bottling. Listing both also means that they don't have to change their labeling every time they change sweetener.) This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Superstore would be recommended. Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" Help, Bisquick!",3,"Bought them when they first came out. Somewhere around August 2009? Went a little ""nutty"" and expecting them to be great and using the offer Atkins was offering pre-release, I purchased 3 bags. Wanted to love them, as a matter of fact. Found the texture too ""gritty"" for my complete approval and a somewhat of an after taste. Not very pronounced but present, never the less. The main purpose was to be able to enjoy tasty pancakes with less guilt but in the end, after trying to make biscuits one day, I had to ask help from my old buddy Bisquick. Bisquick basically said to me: ""I understand your frustration but why don't you add one cup of that Atkins Mix and two cups of me plus eggs and see how that goes?"". I admit it is unusual to be having a conversation with a box of bisquick but in this case I did not regret the sound advice. The quality improved immediately, waffles or pancakes, and now all I had to worry about was finding out a (real difficult to find) perfect sugar free syrup to match the serving of pancakes (traditionally every Saturday morning) but that is another story and frankly all this talk about pancakes is making me eye the refrigerator way more that I would like to at this time. 3 Stars for the idea is commendable. Regretfully, on the practice, this baking mix is not as good as it probably could have been? Must say that Atkins has pulled through several times for me and their products are always excellent alternatives with a whole less sugar. See? I am not badmouthing anyone that didn't have it coming! …",44 out of 49 users found this review helpful

 Not 100% raisins -- Contains Additive  ---  UPDATED 10-25-12,3,"I purchased the Made in Nature ""Club Pack"" size because the price was good and the description seemed identical to the Made in Nature product sold as a 12-pack of 6 oz. bags. The latter product had the following listed for the Nutrition Facts link: ""Unsulfured, Sun-dried, Certified Organic Seedless Raisins."" In other words, no additives are listed. I thought that the Club Pack size would be the same, even though the Superstore description did not include a Nutrition Facts link. Well, I just got my order today and the packages listed ""organic sunflower oil"" as an additive. Also, it is disconcerting that the package does not specifically state that the raisins are unsulfured. I will not be purchasing these raisins again. Update: I increased my rating after checking further and finding out that the raisins are unsulfured. Also, the added sunflower oil is apparently less than 1%. Nevertheless, this information should be listed on the web page. Sunflower oil apparently reduces clumping of the raisins. Personally, I would rather have clumping and no sunflower oil since I do not want extra sources of fat in my diet (especially ones that are high in Omega 6 fats). The raisins themselves are nothing special....they are average in both taste and appearance. UPDATE #2: After reading recent reviews on this product, I decided to check the Made In Nature website to see if sunflower oil was still being added. The package label on the website still shows the additive. However, I sent an e-mail about this to Made In Nature and got the following reply: ""Thank you for contacting Made In Nature. We are pleased to hear that you are interested in purchasing our products through Superstore and understand the importance of consumers such as yourself, to be absolutely certain of the ingredients used in products. Currently, we do not add any organic sunflower oil to the raisins, and haven't done so for the past few months. We are also in the process of removing it from the cranberries as well. Our ultimate goal is to have all of our products include only the dried fruit itself. I hope this helps and answers any question you may have regarding the ingredients used in our products. If you have any further questions, comments, or concerns, never hesitate to reach out. Thank you for your support in Made In Nature!

 Great Fruit Snacks - Highly Recommended!,5,"A friend recommended these Brothers Crisps and I am very pleased that we took her advice! Being a type 2 diabetic and trying to watch my carbs and calories, these are good snacks that satisfy my sweet-tooth cravings without overly spiking up my blood sugar levels. The real test with any ""good for you"" snacks is if my teens will eat them, and they also love them! These are made from real fruit (and nothing else) that has been sliced and freeze dried, making them crispy (exactly like ""Astronaut Ice Cream"") but they will reconstitute in your mouth if you leave them in long enough. This process also makes them very flavorful. This variety pack has an assortment of 3 different types, Fuji Apple, Strawberry Banana, and Asian Pear. Fuji Apple: About 1 1/2 Apples per pack 39 Calories 7 NET Carbs (6 from sugar) Strawberry Banana: About 1 Banana and 4 Strawberries per pack 45 Calories 8 NET Carbs (6 from sugar) Asian Pear: About 1 1/2 Pears per pack 40 Calories 8 NET Carbs (7 from sugar) I like the Asian Pears the best, but all of the flavors are really good.

 Amazing For Finicky Eaters and Stomach Issues,5,"If you have a dog that turns his or her nose up to all dry and wet foods from premium names such as Wellness CORE, Merrick, Blue Buffalo, Evo, Stella and Chewy's Freeze Dried Patties, Dr. Harvey's etc. then you have to give this a try. My dog is a 40lb Sheltie/Collie mix so having a large highly active dog that wouldn't eat was very stressful I hear many people with toy breeds having the problem but I never thought I would happen with a high energy dog. I was shocked that she hated all other dog food and would only eat a little if I wet the dry food and hand fed her she would really try and starve herself any other way and she was not holding out for human food because I do not give her any knowing the problem would of got worse, if that was possible. I found this food by searching online for food for picky eaters and this came up. I was not hopeful because a lot of the brands I previously tried had similar reviews of picky eaters liking it and my my dog not. When I read that it was jerky like pieces it sparked an interest because she loves those types of treats. The company sent me a Venison trial bag and I purchased the Lamb 2.2lb bag and she lovesssss it. She wakes me up now at 8am whimpering by the bag because she wants it soooo much. The smell and texture is incredible I never saw her eat so fast and she is so much more energetic and happy this food is amazing and not that expensive considering the smaller portion.

 How Could You Be So Bold,5,"After FINALLY purchasing best coffee maker I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Superstore, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold. Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold. What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's. There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Superstore. Wake up people, and add this to your cart.

 A fan,5,"Ok, this stuff is the cure for family visits lol. I only had this stuff a week or so before going home to visit my very large and loud family that although I love dearly, can drive me crazy when it's unheard of to stay in a hotel. I drank this in the evenings and it is like it melted everything away including the anxiety of staying with my mother and dealing with her obsession of cleaning with her new mini sweeper, going here and there to see this and that person, having to of course spend extra money that I normally don't, AND having my Weimaraner at my moms hearing her gripe about what his claws will do to her wood floor. I know, too much information but seriously....I generally crack and I held it together this time. I give some of the credit to this stuff. Its taste is pleasant and it is easy for an on the go status like what I was. I recommend this to anyone who has a lot on their plate, especially if it is temporary and you aren't used to dealing with it all on a regular basis. That kind of stress can lead to a meltdown! I usually get sick with a really bad cold or such within a week of being back in my own environment but this time I did not.

The ""Greens"" flavor made me think that... they will taste like greens! It seemed like a great find. Greens- Well, there might be ""greens"" in these puffs but you sure can't taste any of it. What do they taste like? They taste sweet- an outer coating of sweetness, followed by a rice puff flavor. I do not agree with another reviewer who says that they are ""just like Cheerios"". Sugar content- They might have only 0.5g of sugar per serving, but compared with Cheerios this is still double the sugar (those have 1 in 28g). Not that Cheerios are the measure for all baby snacks, and they are certainly not organic, but they are at least not sweet tasting. Packaging- You will receive a box with six plastic dispensers similar to the ones you get for wipes. Each container contains 2.1 oz (60 g) of rice puffs.

 Tastes great ... and gets 2-year-old approval,5,"These multrigrain chips taste like restaurant-quality corn tortilla chips, but they come in individual-sized bags. Most importantly, my two-year-old daughter (who is so picky she hardly eats anything) absolutely LOVES these chips. These chips are technically ""multigrain"" because they contain yellow corn, brown rice flour, flax seeds, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and soy flour. However, stone ground yellow corn is clearly the main ingredient in these chips and you'll have a hard time picking up the flavor of the other ingredients with your taste buds. The other thing I really like about these chips is that they're flavored with sea salt, which is lower in sodium and (in my opinion) tastes better than regular table salt. With only 140 calories per bag and 7 grams of fat it's hard not to say yes to this tasty treat. Overall, I highly recommend these chips! …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Tofu Shirataki Noodles,5,"I first heard about Shirataki noodles years ago and decided I would try it. I went to Fiesta and got these Tofu Shirataki Noodle. Shirataki are made from Konjac yams and the added tofu gives it a harder texture. The noodles without tofu added is 0 calories. The one with tofu is 20 cal per 4 oz which is low in cal. I always rinse the noodles first. I never cook it longer than 3 minutes. The first time I ever made Shirataki Noodles I cooked it like regular pasta and it turned into a gel--this was years ago. I learned that was the worst mistake to make and changed how I make these noodles. The next time I made it correctly and tried to eat it with pasta sauce. That didn't work for me, since the flavors did not merry and I was accustomed to the hard texture of pasta. The noodles are similar to the texture of vermicelli rice noodles. I personally prefer it in soups and not as a substitute for spaghetti. I would sometimes eat it with a sauce I make with soy sauce, shredded ginger, chili paste, and sprinkle green onions on top for looks. I have tried this rinsed without it being cooked and it has no flavor whatsoever. It isn't like Ramen noodles which as a flavor without anything added. Even though I still eat the Tofu Shirataki, I just got the one without tofu and it is very similar. The one without tofu is 0 cal which is a plus. Update: I did some more research on Shirataki noodles in order to expand my ideas with recipes. I found that the reason that my shirataki noodles may have turned into mush was because it expired. It seems Shirataki noodles is still good for a year and even after it is still edible however it would turn to mush if cooked too long. These noodles also apparently shrink and become thinner, something it seems some people like. I went to the store that I used to get my Tofu Shirataki noodles, and looked at the for an expiration date. Lo and behold, it was expired by over a year. I even saw some in the store expired by over 2 years. It seems that non expired shirataki noodles will become alot more chewy if cooked too long. My mom used it in stir fry, and I have also tried it baked which is also a great idea. I been lazy and not just use any boullion cube with the noodles and that works fine...I just let it sit in the seasoning for a few hours to take the flavor of the soup. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful

" Not bad, not great either.",3,"I purchased this coffee because both the Newman's Own and Sumatran Reserve were priced up near $1 per k-cup this month, and I needed something dark and bold to replace them until the prices came back down. This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish. The caffeine content is acceptable. The package could have been treated a little better during shipping as there were lots of dents, crushed corners and sides, and evidence of bending on the sides of the k-cups. None of the cups have thus far shown a broken seal though. Overall this is an acceptable extra bold style k-cup, but there are better options out there. My favorites have been the Newman's Own and the Sumatran Reserve. I haven't tried the Black Diamond K-cups as they are a bit pricey right now also. I'll probably end up using a coupon and buying my preferred flavors in a brick and mortar store nearby for a better price, or ordering some Coffee People 50-count extra bold flavors. Their boxes have had pretty stable pricing for the past 6 months or so. If you are out of options, this is a cheaper substitute for a pricier extra bold flavor. I wish Superstore could sort out their supply issues and keep K-cup prices a little more stable. Lastly, I wouldn't buy these again if I had other similar priced options. TL;DR - These are okay, but go for other extra bold flavors if they are priced about the same. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 This is the reason to own a Keurig!,5,"My first ""pod"" coffeemaker was a Senseo, now relegated to the garage. Limited coffee options. Weak tasting coffee. Bought the Keurig based on Superstore reviews and liked it from the first. Now I love it, because I found a dark, deeply satisfying roast that makes my day. Full on coffeehouse flavor with no bitter aftertaste. It's one of three featured varieties in our office-- Timothy's Breakfast Blend, Coffee People Black Tiger, and Tully's Italian Roast. We have all three on subscription and they're a hit with both staff and client partners. BTW, my personal choice is almost always this one. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 feed your sadistic side,4,"Come on, read the label. One of the manufacturer's suggested uses is removal of driveway oil stains. For the last five years or so, I have always had a bottle of this sauce on hand specifically for those friends who swear nothing is ever too hot. The ultimate gratification comes from watching as they disregard any admonishments that direct consumption of any amount greater than a swab on a toothpick is too much. It is particularly helpful to quiet those who cannot refrain from talking over movies or provide undesired running commentary during sports events. Invariably, for next hour their only objective is to regain the ability to breathe normally. The only downside is this ploy only works once. I like to mix about an 1/8 of a teaspoon with two ounces of regular hot sauce for buffalo wings, or add a dab to any taco sauce, however care is required because you can easily reach a point of diminishing returns as the unavoidable numbing of one's tastebuds makes enjoyment of the food impossible. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" MOLD forms due to DESIGN FLAW, and company will not return!",1,"Please DO NOT buy this product or anything from HEALTHCHECK SYSTEMS! I don't know how they can call themselves by that name. I happened to read another reviewer who found mold in the water reservoir, got an exchange, and had the same thing happen. I used this as intended with the splatter shield, and ran it through multiple de-scalings by using vinegar/water, and the mold did not go away- except some gets into the food basket each time you steam! So, your baby is eating his/her food with mold in it. The company says they don't have this problem- probably because they are ignorant and don't care about me sending it back to test it, and people don't know because it is hard to see into the reservoir. I have only used this for about 4 months and am very clean. The manager hung up on me! They refused to listen to what I had to say, and stand by their 30-day return policy! Mold does not grow in 30 days! They must know their product is garbage with that kind of return policy. I can't believe they are allowed to sell products under that name that can cause babies and children to get sick! It's no wonder my baby had a temporary ""unknown"" allergy!

 I like this Nut Milk Bag (purchased from Superstore.com),5,"This is my first nut milk bag and it works well for me. I usually use a cheese cloth for straining my Almond milk and it was a little more work. I had to be careful the cheese cloth did not slip and create a mess. When I make almond milk, I use a large strainer first, then I use the milk bag to get a smooth, silky almond milk. If you initially pour the almond milk directly from the blender into the milk bag, you would need to squeeze the bag to get your milk. When you squeeze the bag with a large amount of the pulverized almond, the bag could come apart at the seam. If you don't have a strainer, pour small amounts at a time into the milk bag and squeeze to get all the milk. If you are making your own nut milk, it's best to get a large strainer, it's inexpensive. After blending the almond, pour it through the strainer and then through the milk bag. You will get smooth milk with no gritty taste and your nut bag will last longer. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
" Fantastic Coffee, BUT...",4,"BEST INSTANT, PERIOD! BUT... I can't drink VIA made according to it's instructions. It's just way, WAY, too strong. (I'm talking seriously stronger than what you get at a local Starbucks.) Let me explain. When I make brewed coffee, I freshly grind beans to a very fine texture, using two or three tablespoons of grounds per 6 ounces of water. So I'm used to a strong cup of coffee. Since one packet of VIA makes even a large mug of water into an un-drinkablly strong brew, I use only half a packet. The problem is, a couple hours later, the left-over half becomes an unusable blob that won't come out of the packet. No great loss... I've had a GREAT cup of coffee, and I can just toss the other half packet, right? Well, acutally, that's a problem for me. I'm of the 'clean your plate / starving kids in Biafra' generation. I would prefer a smaller packet at a smaller price. So one star off from someone who was taught 'waste not, want not' and is too old to change ;-) …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 The best option yet for our Keurig Brewers!,5,"Just bought a few of these along with the paper filters. I've been refilling and reusing the regular k-cups and although cost effective and environmentally responsible, a big mess. The biggest issue I had with refilling was that it was a pain and it was a bit messy. I could also only get a few good uses before the filter deteriorated. Now here comes these new EZ-Cups! These are simple to use. Throw in a filter, add your favorite roast, snap on the lid and brew. There is a spring and a tamper built into the EZ-Cup so that when you snap on the lid the coffee gets tamped/compressed a bit so that the hot water flows through uniformly. The best part is that the cleanup up is a breeze! Open the lid to the EZ-Cup and toss the filter and used grounds. Ready for the next cup! No mess and I think very convenient. Brew quality is excellent as you can choose your own favorites and control how much coffee to use. These just work! Great idea! …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs. They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a ""garbage belly"" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the ""green"" in Greenie Bones.

Antic"" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are ""deadly"", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list). If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole. Do we need to bring up ""NYLABONES""????? Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats. Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post. You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box. I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay. My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie ""Smart Biscuits"" for an afternoon snack. They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!

" Golden Flax Seed is sweet and nutty tasting, NOT bitter!",5,"GOLDEN flax seed meal is never bitter or gritty, and Bobs Red Mill is the finest quality! We add it to ALL baking and everyone loves it. Example: We use this meal INSTEAD OF FAT in muffins and they are moist and delicious! For instance, if the recipe calls for 1/2 cup of oil, we substitute 1/2 cup of golden flax seed meal. Its that simple. The muffins (regardless of the type) turn out tasty and stay fresh for days! This is a MUCH better fatty fiber than any other you could add to baking. Plus, golden flax seed meal SATISFIES! You will require less food when you eat it. PLEASE NOTE - something seldom mentioned about FLAX - it is a laxative! - so add it to your diet slowly, or you may regret it. Flax calms your appetite, aids digestion, fills you up, regulates your bowels, gives STAMINA, and is a great source of Omega III fatty acids, among other things. It adds more value to your diet, naturally, than anything else you've ever tried! Your health will improve SO much after a few weeks of using this meal, you will never stop using it!

" Incredible, Incredible Food!!",5,"My pup (3 year old maltese) has a serious allergy to grain and a generally screwed up digestive system. The first year of his life was sort of trial and error when it comes to the right kind of dog food for him and a lot of long nights with upset stomachs. Eukanuba (which can barely be called dog 'food') nearly killed him and he ended up having to get fluids injected because of how dehydrated he got on it. Hundreds of dollars to the vet later, we did research on dog food and the common grain allergy. We have tried all of the good grain-free brands, like Evo, Wellness, Merrick, etc. Orijen has been the best of the bunch. If you are worried about your dog having too much protein, I haven't really had a problem at all despite my little dog. He has been on Orijen for over two years and he is pretty much all lean muscle (all 13lbs of him!), despite being mostly sedentary outside of daily walks. He has clear, tear-stain free eyes, a shiny coat, and has never been sick since starting on this food. I can't help but think his excellent quality food has been keeping him healthy!

 Where's the mouse?,5,"I don't have much time. I am a cat being held prisoner somewhere in Southern California. The dog is watching, but he is easily fooled. I told him I'm playing the piano, he is a moron. While I am not ""mistreated"" in the usual sense of the word, I must escape before I go mad. The large, hairless two-legged creatures who hold me prisoner are well-meaning, I think, but so unevolved, they are almost to be pitied if I did not hate them so. They feed me this pasty food in a can. Me. Cat. I am a hunter, a living weapon. I crave blood, fresh warm meat between my teeth. I yearn for crunchy bones filled with hot marrow. Not Chicken and Tuna shreds in sauce. Last month I almost caught a moth. Ahh, the chase. First, my lethal approach...subtle yet as perilously accurate as an arrow. Inch by inch I crept up to my prey, every muscle alive, every sense at it's peak, yet as silent as death. The juicy moth just sat there, never sensing my presence. I came close, very close, paused and then -- I pounced! If the fools had a shorter table I would never have overshot the mark and hit the wall. **** them forever. My ear, my beautiful ear...a precision instrument and objet d'art all in one, was bent. Yes, bent. And what did the two legs do? They punished ME. Yes, As punishment I was taken to a place called The Vet, where other two-legged monsters did unspeakable things like shaving my beautiful fur and putting strips of white fabric over my beautiful head. Then they forced a megaphone over my head. This trip was far less horrifying than my last visit, however. You wouldn't believe what they did to me. You Would Not Believe It. I can hardly believe it myself except when I look down and...well, never mind, but it's worse than you could ever imagine. Ever. Finally The Vet creatures returned me to my captors...but they would not remove The Cone of Humiliation from off my head. ""Two more weeks, Beebo, you need to wear it for two more weeks and then you'll be fine, azza bwave Beebo, bwave bwave boy."" That's the sentence they handed down. The Cone of Humiliation is designed to break me. It will not, even though the dog now laughs at me. At ME. Let him laugh. I have plans for him. Yes indeedy. I have plans. The Two-Legs call me Beebo. ""Izzee my baby Beebo. Izze wanna skwatchie skwatchie ittle Beebo, come to Mommy, Mommy wuv Beebo"" they say. To Me. Me, the Warrior King. I am not a cocker spaniel. I am a living weapon, a Cat. Were it not for the ear-scratching, head-scratching, special pillow near the fireplace and opportunities to torment the dog, I would dispose of the two-leggers and escape. I do not wish to harm two such well-meaning but stupid creatures, but I must have meat. I would eat the dog, but I've seen what he eats, and quite frankly, I'm appalled. Please, if anyone is out there, help me. Send meat...a box of mice...fat and juicy ones...would make a life of captivity almost livable. Also, since you are putting the package together, I could do with another Feather on a String, two boxes of Fishy Treatz (not the liver, mind you), oh, and one more thing...a chicken bone. A nice, easily-shattered, sharp edged chicken bone...with a nice little piece of bacon to wrap it in. A gift for a friend, shall we say... Act fast.

 Great Tasting Low Carb Pasta,5,"I have used Dreamfields Healthy Carb Living pastas for over a year now. I like the taste of whole wheat pastas, but some people don't or they don't want to eat it all the time.

 good soup,3,"this soup is delicious, but i have a couple complaints with the packaging: 1. the soup is not a 'one-step' preparation thing as most instant soups are. when you peel back the lid, there's a packet of spices inside that you must remove and open, and pour into the cup, before you add hot water. i always seem to spill this powder onto my countertops, as the 'tear line' isnt clean either. i don't understand why this additional spice packet is not just in the cup of soup to begin with, as it is dry powder just like the soup mix. weird. 2. there are two servings per container! this makes no sense to me, as i can't possibly imagine someone eating half the soup cup and saving the rest for later. it looks to me like a marketing gimmick to make the soup appear to have fewer calories, sodium and carbohydrates than it actually does.

" Best taste, best froth, organic, and reasonable cost",5,"This morning I taste-tested 3 top-rated Matcha green teas that I recently purchased on Superstore. 1. Serendipi Tea matcha culinary grade organic green tea from Japan, 4 oz. costs $17.43 (result: *****) 2. Tea Zone matcha green tea powder, 8 oz. costs $16.99 (Superstore sells this as `Matcha Green Tea Powder By Malden Tea', but my black foil packaging label says it's made by Tea Zone) (result: ****) 3. Liquid Jade powdered matcha green tea 100% organic, 3 oz. Cost $18.46 (result: ***) Recipe: I made 3 different cups of `green tea latte' with the following method: 1 tsp tea powder, mixed with filtered water into a smooth paste, added to 1/3 cup hot soymilk + 1/3 cup boiling water + 1 tsp raw agave nectar, frothed into a Latte-style tea with hand-pump device. NOTE: I am a scientist. Each cup was clearly labeled. I tasted the teas side-by-side, taking 3 sips of each before proceeding to next sample. I tasted in random order until all 3 cups were consumed. Total time: 15 minutes. I took lots of notes and drew graphs etc. Result: Serendipi Tea (5+ stars) won for sweet smooth flavor, amazing long lasting froth bubbles, and the fact it's organic!! Cost: $4.30/oz but worth it. Note on the packaging: For those reviewers complaining of the green tea powder leaking, I have to point out that it's hand packed, with a note explaining that you must pack it yourself in an airtight and light-blocking container. Fine with me, since this is the best tea I've found, and the act of packing it myself is itself a ZEN moment in which I feel a connection to the individual soul who packed the brown bag by hand just for me. You decide. Tea Zone (Malden Tea) (4+ stars) came in second for a very nice flavor, but the frothy bubbles popped sooner than the Serendipi Tea, making for a lower rating, and plus, it isn't organic. But it gets extra points for its low cost: $2.12/oz (can't beat it for a daily tea). Liquid Jade (3 stars) was an O.K. tea, ever-so-slightly more bitter than the other two I taste tested, and almost a chalky feeling (perhaps it was ground into larger particles than the other teas). Yes it's organic, always a plus, but at a cost of $6.15/oz, no way will I buy this again when I can get TeaZone 4 stars for a third this cost, and Serendipi Tea 5 stars for significantly less money as well.

 Good food for allergic dogs,5,"Last August we brought home a lhasa apso mix from a local shelter. He was a mess with shaggy, unkept fur and after we had him groomed, we discovered he was covered in scabs and hives. Several visits to the vet didn't get us any closer to figuring out what was causing the hives, but we thought it might be related to the food he was eating. We tried several different brands, from Eukanuba to Science Diet, but they all contained corn/grains, and the hives continued to get worse. Then we switched to a raw food diet, which immediately cured the hives and itchiness. But raw food isn't practical when you're away from home frequently, like we are. Plus, I'm not convinced that a raw food diet gives my dogs all the nutrients they need to stay healthy. So we tried several different grain free brands and finally settled on the Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free dry dog food. He loves it and he's been hives free for several months now. We switch between the salmon and duck formulas. An 11-pound bag lasts my two little dogs about a month. Another nice side effect is that they smell better and their skin/coats are healthier. My 11-year old chiweenie has more energy than she's had in a few years. Oh...and no more diarrhea or constipation - just nice, little turds that are easy to clean up. The price on Superstore is the same as what I'd pay at the local pet store and the shipping is free. Saves me the price of gas driving to the store and lugging it home. I would highly recommend this dog food to anyone whose dog has itchy/smelly/scabby skin problems. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Very Versatile Molecular Gastronomy Sampler Kit,5,"This kit includes a great selection of popular agents in molecular gastronomy that are sure to please the trendy chef looking to take his/her cooking or pastry skills to the next level. As the enclosed phamplet states, this kit is for the ""art of molecular cuisine"" and it is most definitely an art worthy of exploration. It's kind of an science kit that lets you create incredibly creative food for artistic presentation. Very cool. Each agent comes in a nice 50 gram size so you have plenty of opportunity to try different techniques before deciding which agents you want to buy in larger sizes. The agents allow you to experiment with transformation (transforming high-fat liquids into powders), spherification (such as making fruit caviar), thickening, emulsification (dispursing liquids into fats, mostly) and gelification (creation of both soft and hard gels). It also comes with a small kit for storing the samples. I am impressed with the quality of the agents in this kit as well as quantity provided for experimenting. I'm even more impressed with the incredibly quick shipping by Artistre. I'm looking forward to further experimentation with the included agents, as well as trying a few items not in the kit - like the carbonating and foaming/aerating agents.

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",33 out of 48 users found this review helpful
 These bars are too expensive for how tiny they are.,1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:13 Mins </span>Since I can't attach a photo to my review, I decided to take a video of my 8 year old son opening one of these bars so you can see first hand how small they are in comparison to a small boy's hands. I purchased these for my son who has celiac disease. We were incredibly disappointed on the packaging and size of these bars. Based on the size of the box and the picture on the front, we expected full size bars - not a tiny gummy square. Most of the packaging is air. My son does like the taste of these however. The packaging just seems misleading and they seem to be way too expensive for what they are. …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 Great salt,5,"This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a ""rounded"" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Delicious!,5,"This stuff is great. I'm on a diet that includes superhydration - meaning I drink 5-6 liters of water a day - and anything to make that easier is worth it! Aspartame is a migraine trigger for me so I am always on the lookout for alternative low calorie water flavorings and this truly fits the bill. As for the chemical haters, if you don't want it in your body, don't put it there! I don't believe this is any more dangerous than the preservatives and additives you'd find in a bag of chips. Most things are OK in moderation and if that thing helps you drink more healthy water without a bunch of sugar and caffeine, consider it a blessing. And if you do find out that you have a negative reaction to any of the ingredients, like me to aspartame, just stop using it. Now, on to the review. I've tried this (strawberry watermelon) and the berry pomegranate flavor. This one gets 5 stars on flavor; berry gets 4. Both have a little aftertaste that's kind of sticky sweet and noticeable but not unpleasant. The berry flavor tastes a little grapey to me and it's just a personal preference that I don't like it as much. I bought mine on sale at Target for less than they are listed here, but even for the Superstore price I think they are worth it even if you add more than 1/24th of the bottle to your drink. Consider the powdered drink flavorings that come in single-serve packs and are priced comparably. Less servings, more waste packaging, no customization of flavor intensity. MIO is the clear winner. Five stars on value! My only improvement would be to have less or different dye in the product. I don't care if my drink is hot pink or purple but the first time I used it, I got a couple of drops on my countertop and it left a stain that was a pain in the you-know-what to get out. I'm guessing that it wouldn't come out of clothes, either. Just keep that in mind and be careful. If you're curious about MIO, I would suggest you go to your grocery store, buy one, and try it. If you love it, come here and get a case! It's a neat, novel idea and I hope it sticks around because I'm a big fan. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Not Very Good Taste - Tea Leaves Mix of Chopped and Full Leaf,3,"I have been living in Shanghai for over four years now, so I have a pretty good idea of what good tea tastes like. And this is not even close to good tasting tea. I drink only the best quality Long Jing Green Tea and I drink about 1.5 liters per day. But I admit that my Chinese green tea is much more expensive than this tea.. I like my tea cold and with a little sugar. I brew my own tea in China at 180 degrees F, not hotter and not cooler. I put the tea in the microwave oven in a glass container with plastic wrap over the top of the pitcher. The plastic wrap helps maintain the heat for longer after the peak temperature has been reached. I let it brew for probably an hour until it cools down to a slightly warm temperature. I pour in one-third a cup of sugar and mix it while the tea is warm. I brew the tea leaves two times with half of the 1.5 liter bottle of water each time. Then I mix the tea together and refrigerate it for at least 24 hours, preferably 48 hours. I have found the refrigeration cycle makes the tea mellower and not bitter. Even my 56 year old Chinese fianc&eacute;e says my tea brewing method tastes better than she has ever tasted in her life. I know that refrigeration is contrary to what a lot of people think is best. But I learned this technique when I was a teenager working in a Baptist Encampment in Texas during the summer. A cook taught me that putting the huge vat of tea into a cooler for a day makes tea more mellow tasting and less bitter. And I always got great compliments way back then from the hundreds of people who drank my tea. Of course, this was just ordinary tea, not green tea. But it works the same way with green tea. The tea leaves in this tea do not look the same as what I buy in China, and the taste is quite different -- definitely bitterer. The Numi Tea sold here on Superstore is whole leaf and looks a lot better than these tea leaves. These tea leaves are a mix of whole leaf and confetti chopped up leaves. The taste is about the same as Numi Tea, but I will purchase the Numi brand going forward because it is 100% whole leaf and not dusty. I have read that the best leaves are the newly formed leaves picked from of the top of the tea tree. I have visited tea tree farms in China. Tea trees will grow into a real tree unless they are pruned to remain like a waist high tree shrub. I suspect this particular brand of tea leaves may have come from the older more mature lower branches of the tea tree. But I have no way of knowing if that is true or not. I just know it doesn't taste nearly as good as the tea leaves I purchase in China. And to be fair, the price I pay in China is considerably more than this price on Superstore. …",11 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 HOLY BLOATING! Dont use too much in one meal!,1,"I love the Nativa brand, however, they always seem to leave out very important details on their packaging. I heard so many praises about how much better the Chia seeds are than Flax seeds. Upon arrival I opted to use these in my salad as opposed to the flax seeds I've been using. The Chia seeds caused the most horrible and painful bloating I ever experienced. Granted, I did use the full serving size, but since then I lowered the amount and STILL with even just a quarter of a teaspoon or less I get the bloating. I have since switched back to the Flax seeds which didn't wreak havoc on my intestinal tract. I am hoping I can find some way to use these seeds in the future because I hate seeing anything go to waste. My advice if you are set on trying the Chia seeds is to start out with a very low amount!!! And stick with that low amount until your stomach builds up a tolerance for these seeds. …",8 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Must have been a contaminated batch,1,"We bought a case of 12 12 oz cans back in April. Just now opened the first can. Wow. Consistency of vomit, grayish tinge, and a vile odor. Opened a second can -- exactly the same. No way were we going to feed it to our dog. Something was clearly wrong. We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase. Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA. …",20 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 Don't buy this garbage!,1,"I bought a case of this (Adult Organic Turkey and Organic Vegetables Formula)12.7 oz cans beause my dog adores the Organix Dry Dog Food and he does very well on it.

I ended up giving a can to a friend and her dog had horrible breath (from his stomach--does not have bad teeth). I didn't give the rest away, will throw it away. I emailed the company twice and they couldn't bother to respond in about two weeks. Apparently they don't stand by their products.

The flavor is . . . well . . . no flavor. The noodles absorb the flavors added to them. If you rinse the noodles then dry them in paper towel before using, they will absorb the flavors even more. My favorite way to use the noodles is with pesto sauce, especially if I'm eating low-carb. They are VERY filling and an excellent way to stay full while losing weight.
