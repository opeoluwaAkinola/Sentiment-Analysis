 Bad for My Dog,1,"My dog was on a bland diet (boiled chicken & rice) so his poop was usually solid but a few days after eating 1 Greenie a day, his poop became more liquid-y and green. Not sure if Greenies was actually the cause until I googled and read on various dog forums about how Greenies have affected other dogs. Stopped giving out my dog Greenies and have thrown them away. BEWARE, Greenies CAN be bad, so watch your dog after giving them out. …",10 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Golden Torpedos of Deliciousness!,5,"How can you not love the Twinkie? It's compact, delicious, and aerodynamic. If you actually look at the ingredients, Twinkies are made of flour, water, shortening, eggs, sugar... sound familiar? It's cake. There are some preservatives added to increase shelf life, but they make up a very small percentage of the overall treat. The air we breathe probably contains more dangerous 'additives' than a twinkie. Let us face facts; if one were to eat slice after slice of chocolate cake baked using organic ingredients, that person is going to end up in coronary bypass land just as quickly as if one gorged on Twinkies. Twinkies, like anything, in moderation are just fine. …",12 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 BEWARE - Superstore LIMITS THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU CAN BUY,1,"The food is GREAT. The cats have gotten completely addicted to it. BUT....what Superstore doesn't bother to mention is that ""quantities are limited"". I have been buying this food for my 3 cats for about 6 months. It comprises roughly half their diet (or 3 cats/day). I just went to re-order and was repeatedly told ""there's a problem"". Long story, and 2 phone calls plus 2 emails later, I was told I have bought the LIFETIME MAXIMUM of this product. I ordered it for almost twice the price via the marketplace, but I am furious with Superstore. NOWHERE on this page do they tell you there's a limit. So I'm here to tell you there is. The food is great, but don't get used to buying it here. …",16 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 great price point,4,"GOOD POINTS: - great pricing (I got the Roland sale + subscription discounts) - well packed (heavy plastic bag inside thin metal ""paint can""-like tin - fresh & tender AMBIVALENT ISSUES: - the label says, ""baby ginger"", which I find hard to believe. First, the ginger has quite a lot of heat when eaten on its own. [It's now 1/2 hour after eating one slice with millky tea; my mouth still feels the heat and I am NOT sensitive to spice.] Second, about 20% is moderately to extremely fibrous. Third, the slices are medium to large, which would be alright if lengthwise, but one can see that they are crosswise (large rhizomes). None of these are qualities I associate with baby ginger. The reason I'm ""ambivalent"" is that while I think the label is incorrect, the Superstore product description does not include this, so it wasn't a factor in my purchase. - the sugar used is much coarser than usual (about 3-4x the size of US white sugar). The Australian and US candied ginger I've enjoyed in the past used extra fine sugar (US ""baking sugar""). My issue is that the coarser sugar doesn't cling and make a crust to protect the ginger, the way extra fine does. Also, about 1/3 of the pieces have unsightly clumps of sugar on them, which I remove before serving or using for baking. NEGATIVE: - the fiber issue mentioned above is something I never encountered with Australian or US candied ginger. Unpleasant to eat and embarrassing for the hostess. Also slows down baking prep. - the big crystals are mostly an esthetic issue, but there is the safety issue of one's blade catching on a crystal and the blade bouncing a little as the sugar shatters. Still trying to find a work-around for chopping and mincing. - The ""paint can"" is difficult to work with. Obviously, I can remove some ginger and finesse the rest of the bag out of the can, to store as I like; but this is a 6 lb quantity packed in a resealable container: the container should be easy to re-seal and re-open. This container needs a tool to be opened; and each use renders the container harder to use--the thin metal dents and bents, so the lid is more and more misshapened. Actually, I'd prefer the packer please just seal the very sturdy plastic bag, label it for sale, and pass the savings on to the consumer. TO SUM UP: A generally good product with great price point, but you have to invest considerable effort to get the best results. (Unless you don't mind a bunch of spiky slivers in your mouth, or your knife slipping again & again.) I love candied ginger as a snack, as a baking ingredient and as a ""food pharmaceutical"", so I'll be purchasing again. If this were a seasonal purchase (e.g., just for holiday baking), I'd pass and look for an easier-to-use product with more consistent quality. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Wonderful glasses,5,"I bought these as a gift for my a friend of my husband. His favorite drink is single malt scotch (he usually drinks McCallum.) My husband and he often have a glass together at the end of the day and we thought the glasses would be better than the coffee mugs they sometimes use! I wasn't sure why this glass was specific to whiskey or scotch. I did look for information about the Riedel types and shapes. According to the manufacturer, the company did research with the help of master distillers in Scotland. This resulted the design of a glass that is an elongated thistle shape on a truncated stem. The design incorporates a small, slightly out-turned lip which directs the spirit onto the tip of the tongue, where sweetness is perceived, and serves to emphasize the elegant creaminess of top quality single malt whiskey. There are two lines of this glass, the Sommelier and the Vinum. The Sommeliers Series Single Malt Whiskey Glass is also available here at Superstore. The Sommelier items are more expensive as the upper part is blown into a mold and the the stem and base are hand-crafted. The Vinum is machine made and more reasonably priced. The Vinum looks very lovely and is very nice and thin, there are no seams on the bowl, stem or base. (The Reidel name is etched on the bottom of the base.) It is made of over 24% lead crystal. The glass is 4 1/2 inches tall. There are 2 glasses per box, they are hand wash only. The box is sturdy and was in perfect condition when they arrived (I worried about this a little bit with such thin glasses.) My husband feels the glasses indeed improve the taste of the scotch, but he isn't sure why. He also said it also makes you appreciate the whiskey more and pay attention to it when you are drinking with the special glasses. They made a beautiful gift with a bottle of his favorite drink. You won't be disappointed in these. …",18 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Can't live without it,5,"Having suffered from Chronic Candida Albicans for over 10 years, I finally came to terms with the idea that I CANNOT have any type of sugars or sweeteners, not even natural sugars from fruits. Being a fruit lover who used to eat lots of fruits on a daily basis, I started looking for a safe way to have sweet stuff without feeding the microorganisms that have been for so long attacking my system. After a lengthy research of more than a year, I found out that though most sweeterners FEED bacteria and Candida Albicans, Xylitol DOES NOT. I started using Xylitol regularly and found out, to my surprise, that my worst Candida symptoms were GONE. The symptoms would recur every time I had fruits (darn!)or something made with refined sugar or other sweeteners like Splenda or Stevia, or even the Aspartame that is used on Diet Drinks. Whether I liked it or not, it became clear to me that I could not eat or drink anything sweet, that I could neither have any fruits and that I could not drink any diet sodas. I have intensely and extensively ""tested"" Xylitol for over a year and I can AFFIRM without a doubt that it is the ONLY sweetener I can use without getting my symptoms back. I buy chocolates made with Xylitol on a regular basis and I use this brand of Xylitol to make chocolate bread and all kinds of cookies. I also make healthy chocolate ice cream with Xylitol, unsweetened cocoa powder and soy milk. If it were not for Xylitol, I would not be able to put anything sweet in my mouth. One of the most recognizable and annoying Candida Albicans symptoms was that I had to get up every one or two hours every night to urinate (!!). It was a nightmare, but it helped immensely when it came to ""testing"" what was good or bad for me. Conclusion: If I stay away from all types of sugars, natural fruits, fruit juices and sweeteners, and only use Xylitol-sweetened stuff, I feel much better in every respect and, very importantly, I can sleep 6 or more hours in a row without waking up to go to the bathroom. …",30 out of 30 users found this review helpful
 Wake Up To Caffienated Perfection!,5,"We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch. It is rich, syrupy and just a bit sweet. My experience, thus far, has been that the K-Cups listed as ""extra bold"" produce the best cups of coffee, but many of those are only available in dark roasts, while I prefer a medium roast. If you're a fan of a good, old fashioned diner-style cup of coffee (like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that), then this is the brew for you. We love it and make sure we always have some on hand. …",53 out of 54 users found this review helpful
" Not the greatest, but not the worst either.",3,"I drink espresso (moka) daily, and go through a 250g/8.8oz brick in about 2 weeks. In my opinion, this isn't the greatest blend from Lavazza that I've had, but it's not the worst coffee I've had either (it definitely beats the drip coffee I'd otherwise get at work). It's a 70/30 robusta/arabica blend, a dark roast with a fruity though noticeably bitter finish (but not as bad as Starbucks or Peet's coffee). The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee. I'd really give it a 2.5 or 3 but then again, all taste is subjective, That being said, this is a reasonable coffee (considering taste vs. price), but I'll probably switch back to my regular (and unfortunately more expensive) blend. …",16 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 good but not great,2,"I have been cooking with the Babycook for 6 weeks now, it works fine but not great. CONS: - You can only make small amounts at the time. - The blender is weak. - The steamer-basket can only be filled half for most vegetables for proper steaming-result. PROS: - Heats, steams, blends all in one handy tool. - Easy to use. - Takes up little space. - Can easily be taken on a trip. On some of the issues people wrote. ""MOLD"": Water is never completely pure so there will be buildup in the water compartment. SOLUTION: Always open the lid as soon as the cycle is done and store without the lid on. Once buildup occurs, which will happen eventually, put 2-3 teaspoons of baking powder into the water compartment, fill up with water, and let stand for a few minutes. Poor out. Put an other 2-3 teaspoons of baking powder into the water compartment, fill up with water, and let stand over night. In the morning rinse out well until the water is clear. If you have hard water you will have lime buildup. Poor some vinegar into the compartment, shake around and let stand for a few minutes, repeat until clean, then rinse well with hot water. ""Steamer-light going on and off"": When you steam the water will evaporate, when the compartment is empty the light will go off indicating that the steam-cycle is done. If you leave the lid on the water compartment on, condense water will gather on the bottom starting a new cycle, the light will go on again, this water will evaporate, the light goes off, and so on and on. SOLUTION: Open the lid on the water compartment as soon as the light goes of the first time. This will also help to dry up the compartment better, creating less buildup. OVERALL: It is a nice tool to have if you cook fresh on a daily basis or have limited counter space. It is easy to use and does a good job on small amounts. If you have a large kitchen or prefer to cook in larger batches and then freeze, buy separate machines (steamer, blender), the babycook can't handle larger amounts. I can recommend for people who have a small kitchen, for people who are planning a trip with baby. I can't recommend for people who cook larger amounts or for more than one baby. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 100% high-fructose sweetner anyone?,2,"Up until yesterday, my family and I enjoyed this product versus raw sugar or any other sweetener. We even got past the extra liquidity of our oatmeal once we added blue agave. Alas, having been informed of yet other feat of ingenious marketing, I am tossing out two unopened and one partially finished bottles. Before consuming another drop, take a look at this recently published article: [...] ""Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food. Sorry. Don't kill the messenger..."" and goes on to say: ""Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener. All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS. In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent. Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you. If you simply must have some sweets, a small amount of agave nectar every once in a while isn't going to kill you. Just don't buy into the idea that it's any better for you than plain old sugar or HFCS."" If anyone is interested in purchasing my unopened bottles, let me know before the end of the week! …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" Good deal, but consider freshness",3,"This is a great price for some good beans, and the awesome Superstore prime shipping is just icing on the cake. However, one important thing to consider: When you buy direct from the roaster's website, the beans are roasted fresh and shipped within a day or two. When you buy from Superstore, though, the beans come from a stack of bags that have been sitting in an Superstore warehouse somewhere. The date code is printed on the bags, and mine was over 6 months old! Anyway, this roaster does make a great product, but I would recommend buying direct from their website. Prices are comparable, so the only downside is you'll have to pay for shipping yourself. …",25 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",19 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Great taste - poor packaging wastes k-cups,3,"I love the taste of this coffee. But apparently they have poor quality control. These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly. You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to. Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem. It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens. I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them. Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing. …",116 out of 128 users found this review helpful

 High Qaulity at an Excellent price,5,"I am a professional chef and specialize mostly in pastry, cakes, and desserts. It plays hell with my diabetes but I just love creating some delicious dessert for friends when we have small gatherings. I usually buy vanilla beans in Tijuana, Mexico because I can get good quality at a decent price. By that I mean the beans tend to be supple, shiny, and aromatic. By ""decent price"" I mean it usually costs me around $1.50 to $2.00 per piece. When I saw this half-pound package at such a low price I was skeptical but I figured the $25 would not be a big risk and if they were bad I can always return them. I ordered on Jan 11 and got them Jan 13. Free two-day shipping being another great feature of my Superstore Prime membership which I now believe is an excellent value. The beans are very high quality. They are ""Gourmet Bourbon"" which means about 30% moisture (a good thing) and they are shiny and nicely oily (you want the oily surface as that is one part where a lot of flavor is located. The other part is in the seeds and that is the reason the bean is split and the seeds scrapped when used). These beans are very fresh as shown by their flexibility (as beans grow old they dry out and get brittle- still usable but not as good). They come sealed in a vacuum bag and that is inside a zip bag. Even through the double packaging the scent is very noticeable and complex. This is a large quantity of beans. If you are not going to use them rapidly I recommend separating into two or three bean lots and vacuum packing those. For optimal shelf-life I keep mine in a wine refrigerator (it gets cool but not cold) where I keep my 20 or 30 pounds of various chocolates. This is an excellent deal on good quality.

 GREAT PRODUCT AND COMPANY!,5,"When you've tried the rest get the best! Tons of info is available on the internet about this miracle root. I've been in the health and fitness all my life and believe that the all natural route is the best. I've been taking Maca Root for years and I'm convinced this company is the best source of the best quality product available. And no, I don't work for or represent the company; I just believe it is best to channel your energy in praising great products rather than crushing the bad ones who no one cares about anyway. There seems to be a misconception on what is healthy in the nutritional supplement realm, so I would like to help enlightened those in search of truly natural ways of health. For example, L-Arginine HCL, Acetyl L-Carnitine HCL and other branch chain aminos, synthetic hormones enhancers, etc... are widely sold as supplements by the most well-known commercial nutritional brands (won't mention names here), and are believed to be excellent nutritional sources. These are synthetically made in labs and are substances your body naturally produces. If you consume these regularly, your body gets lazy and will eventually stop reproducing them. Maca Root on the other end, is a natural source of whole food, which contains essential amino-acids, fatty acids and other great nutrients necessary for optimum health. I would also recommend throwing away all those weight gainers in your vitamin cabinet too. Raw Organic Hemp Protein is the best, with nothing added. For my sex drive, I'd say Maca Root gives a gentle boost, but I'd recommend alternating it or taking it with Tribulus Raw Power , 200 pills, 200,000 mg. High Potency, concentrated, Tribulus Terrestris muscle volumizer, male enhancement, for long term results and for immediate all natural results, I'd recommend Red Sex Dragon - Male Enhancement Pills - Male Performance. Those who expect an immediate and drastic sexual boost from Maca Root Raw Powder have an unrealistic approach.

I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink. I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much. …,16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 1960-s Guang Yun Beeng,4,"I haven't tried this tea yet, but the description is a little misleading. When it is said that this cake can make 75 servings, what they really mean is that you can have 75 ""Gong-fu"" sessions with this tea. This type of Chinese tea is typically put into very small Yixing teapots (approx 5-7gr of tea into a 110-120 ml teapot), rinsed once or twice (probably once for this expensive tea), and then poured into teacups. A very high-quality Puerh (aged ""raw"", not aged ""cooked"") can make anywhere from 5-10 teapots-full of the tea before running out of leaf. Sometimes even more. Usually the desired effect of these very-old teas is not exactly how they taste, because often-times they won't taste like much more than flavored water, but instead the ""Cha-Chi"", which is a type of energy or feeling that your body feels when/after drinking these teas. The feelings can be anything from quite stimulating, to very soothing (almost narcotic). There are many fakes in the market-place, due to extremely rare occurences of any REALLY good, old raw Puerh tea being found outside of Asia. Any that are found will definitely command very high prices because this type of tea is usually hoarded in China, Taiwan, and anywhere else that anyone can find any of it available for purchase. Also, when someone states ""60's Puerh tea"", that is a whole decade of variance to deal with. Before taking the plunge with Puerh tea, start doing your research. Puerh tea has really been taking hold of the West in recent years, and now the East is capitalizing on our desires for really good Puerh teas. There are some very good reliable sources out there, but it usually incurs a monetary learning-curve before you get the hang of who you can trust, and what Puerh teas may be right for you. BUYER BEWARE! I hope I am not overstepping any bounds by saying this, but a good place to start learning about Puerh tea would be ""Puerh Tea- A Westerner's Quest"" website. Good luck, and Good health! …",24 out of 28 users found this review helpful

 Love it!,5,"I have a 8.5 month old Aussie mix. She's about 42 lbs now. This food is magic!! I love it! She's never been ""food motivated"" and so she's always been a little reluctant to eat her kibble, but she honestly LIKES this stuff. She'll do tricks for it like it is a treat. More importantly, her poop is GREAT on this kibble. Finally, it's easy to pick up! This food is a godsend. We've previously tried Innova EVO, California Natural Lamb and Rice Puppy and Adult, and Canidae All Life Stages. Innova EVO gave her the runs, but she was a new puppy. (The pet food store said EVO was rich enough for puppies. My vet disagreed.) California Natural seemed better, but her poop was always so soft that it was messy to pick up, and she never really liked it. She liked the taste of Canidae better - so much so that she would pick it out when I mixed it with the Lamb and Rice. However, her poop didn't really improve until we shifted to Orijen. Magic. This stuff is magic, I say. Besides being the magic food for my dog, it's also made in Canada with almost all Canadian ingredients. From what I've read, they get rice from California and Lamb from New Zealand, but otherwise -- everything comes from farms in and around Alberta. No food recalls on this brand! One word of advice: like with all good dog foods, it's best to keep the bag tightly closed. It goes stale. …",23 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 lower quality food--  not recommended,2,"This isn't the worst quality food you could feed, but it isn't a high quality product, either. Yet the price is comparable to premium quality holistic foods-- probably a marketing decision related to Rachel Ray's starpower? I purchased this during an emergency- an ice storm had begun and I was out of dog food, so I grabbed a small bag at a convenient store on the way home from work. My dogs ate it willingly, although they didn't love it. Nutrish foods (both the chicken and beef options) have lots of indigestible corn, artificial dyes, and gluten. Corn seems to pass through most dogs nearly undigested, leading to large stools and wasted money. Gluten was the ingredient implicated in the tainted pet food scandals over the last couple of years-- it just isn't a wholesome ingredient, and it's one I tend to avoid. The good things I can say about this food are that it doesn't use yucky slaughterhouse ""by-products"", and that it includes great vegetable ingredients. Overall, there are worse options on the grocery store shelves, but this is an overpriced, less-than-great food choice for your best pal. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Ingredients list, so you can make up your own mind: Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brewers Rice, Corn Meal, Soybean Meal, Animal Fat (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols), Corn Gluten Meal, Brown Rice, Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Natural Flavor, Dicalcium Phosphate, Salt, Calcium Carbonate, Dehydrated Alfalfa, Dried Peas, Dried Tomatoes, Dried Carrots, Potassium Chloride, Choline Chloride, Olive Oil, Vitamin E Supplement, Zinc Sulfate, Ferrous Sulfate, Iron Oxide, Dried Parsley, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (Source of Vitamin C), Mixed Tocopherols,plus the expected vitamins. `````````````````` Here are a couple of alternatives you might want to check out: Nutro Natural Choice Ultra Adult Dog Food- net wt. 35 lbs., Blue Buffalo Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs., Wellness Super5Mix Chicken Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag)or Buffalo Lamb & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs. . …",26 out of 27 users found this review helpful

 Trio is my favorite snack/energy bar,5,"Mrs. May's Trio bars are my favorite snack/energy bars. I love them. They come in four flavors. Strawberry is second only to blueberry for my favorite of those flavors; the strawberry ones, like the blueberry ones seem a little sweeter but the sugars content is the same so it may just be my imagination. The name comes from the ingredients. The bars have a trio of trios: 3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits. The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors. The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios. The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower. The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don't really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the ""glue"" that holds all the other ingredients together. Dried strawberries are the third fruit in the strawberry flavor. The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt. These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy. The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher. They also have no preservatives. If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts. Because of the nuts, they have 12 grams of fat per bar, but I've been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is ""good"" fat. The label says there is 1.5 grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated. To round out the rest of the nutrition facts: calories, 170; total carbs, 14g; dietary fiber, 2g; sugars, 6g; protein, 5g; cholesterol, 0g; trans fat, 0g; and sodium, 45mg. I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have. They are low sodium but high in taste and they are really satisfying. I used to get granola bars but these are so much better. …",33 out of 34 users found this review helpful

 Some things do change,1,"I grew up making Appian Way pizza's. For 50 years I enjoyed them. After moving to an area where they are not available in the local stores and not being able to get them from Dial Corp anymore, I sorta gave up enjoying them again. Then I FOUND them on Superstore. With great anticipation I awaited the arrival of part of my childhood. Ripping open the carton and seeing the the package brought back memories of Mom and I making pizza on a saturday night. Mixing, spreading adding cheese and toppings I could hardly wait. Then ""the moment"" arrived, the pizza was golden brown and smelled oh so yummy. I excitedly took my first bite only to be hugely disappointed. After a few more bites it was obvious, someone messed with MY pizza. The sauce is not what it was just a few years ago, let alone what it was 50 years ago. Its nothing more than ketchup with some gook added... what a disappointment. A good product and once again, someone, probably to save a few pennies, ruined a good product. The only thing similar to what Appian Way use to be is the box, and perhaps, the box is the better than whats inside. One more disappointment from the corporate world. I must recommend NOT to purchase this product if you have ever eaten pizza before, you will be totally disappointed. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Confident giving this to my dog,5,"After careful research on the best dry food for my dog's diet, I chose Wellness Core Reduced Fat. My mixed breed dog is low energy and has a tendency to put weight on easily. It was very difficult to find a dog food that does not compromise quality ingredients to make a food low fat. Since my dog is low energy (by no means a sled dog), her diet does not require her to have extreme protein intake. This food is the prefect balance of protein, quality meat sources, fat content, as well as important sources of fruits and vegetables and fish oils. Her eyes are bright and coat is shiny. While she hasn't lost any weight, she hasn't gained any either, which is a good thing! You get what you pay for when it comes to dog food.

This is almost the total amount of carbs allowed diabetics for a complete meal. Only 1/2 cup is the maximum of carbs for a meal. Who can eat just one cup of pasta? It is very misleading to diabetics as ""digestible carbs"" has no meaning to them. Total carbs less fiber is what counts to a diabetic. Thus diabetics beware. If you want to eat it remember, 1/2 cup is a complete meal of carbs. …",10 out of 28 users found this review helpful

 I really wanted to love this for our boy,2,"We were unhappy with the food our breeder used. High percentage of corn. After reading lots of labels, in theory this seemed to be just what we were looking for. We went through a careful, slow transition, but this turned out to be way too harsh on our Havanese's GI tract. He ate it just fine, but we would see a progression to larger and more greenish stool, then loss of form until he had a true liquid event. That was the end of that! For anyone with a toy breed, if you would like another option, we eventually transitioned over to Wellness Small Breed Super5Mix Adult Health Small Breed Formula Dry Dog Food . This turned out to be both a food he loves and the transition was effortless. He is behaving very puppy-like @ 3 years old which I feel is a good thing.

We got about two pots (8 to 12 cups) per bag without the coffee being too watered down. Definitely a hit with any coffee drinkers in your life. I sprung for the gift wrapping and was not disappointed.

It's a lot of fun watching our dog figure out how to get at the goodies inside.

 A good brand of coconut oil.,5,"Not all coconut oil is created equal in my eyes. I've tried several brands, and for whatever reason, some smell better than others. This one smells outstanding--a mild sweet coconut scent (as opposed to some that almost have a more savory, toasted coconut flake scent). And at less than $13, the price point is very decent. This is the second time I've tried this brand of coconut oil, and I continue to be satisfied with it. I don't keep it in the refrigerator. I use coconut oil for my skin on a daily basis, I also take a spoon of it each morning, and I use it to cook certain dishes. For those of you who have never used coconut oil, keep in mind that it's liquid when it's warm, and it solidifies when the temperature dips below 76 degrees Fahrenheit. So don't tilt your jar sideways on a warm day, because the liquidy oil will spill out; and don't be surprised when you open your jar on a slightly cooler day and see a solid white mass! Because it is in a jar as opposed to a bottle, I recommend using a clean spoon to take out what you need (as opposed to your hands) so that you keep the contents of your jar as clean and bacteria-free as possible. If you do put your hands in the jar to scoop out oil, make sure you wash them with soap first, and dry them thoroughly before putting your fingers inside so that you don't contaminate the oil. …",38 out of 39 users found this review helpful
" For more economical choice, check out Pill Pockets for CATS",5,"I have a 100lb dog, an Akita who HATES taking pills. She has NOT had Pill Pockets for Dogs, but she HAS had Pill Pockets for CATS. Now, before you click the ""No"" button after ""Was this review helpful to you?"", read further -- my comments will be of value to those with dogs that take SMALL pills! Andie has been taking pills for hypothyroidism for the past 9 years. Her pills are TINY. Wrapping them in meat or cheese never worked; she simply ate around the pill or spit it out. For years the only way I could get Andie to take pills was to, literally, shove them down her throat. (My hands are small enough and her mouth is big enough for me to do this. Thankfully she's a very trusting dog!) Then one day I was at the vet and noticed packages of something called ""Pill Pockets"". They had two kinds -- one for dogs and one for cats. Both came in flavors that Andie would like, but the dog Pill Pockets came in different sizes (small and large) while the cat Pill Pockets only came in one size (small). I looked at each package very carefully and noticed that the packages for cats had 45 Pill Pockets, while the packages for small dogs only had 35 Pill Pockets. And yet, the packages for small dogs cost MORE than the packages for cats -- huh? (On Superstore they are the same price, but the quantities are different.) So I looked at Andie's tiny thyroid pills, then looked at the Pill Pocket pictures on the packages and decided, ""I might as well save myself a buck and buy the kitty Pill Pockets. What the hey, Andie won't know she's eating something intended for cats!"" I've been happy with that decision ever since. I've bought both the salmon- and chicken-flavored Pill Pockets FOR CATS and Andie likes them both. The pockets are the perfect size, just big enough for her thyroid pills, and to date she has gulped down every one, then begged for another! And I like the fact that I get 10 more in each package than I would if I bought the Pill Pockets ""for dogs"". Pill Pockets are GREAT product, for cats OR dogs. I wish I had discovered them sooner! While I have never used the Pill Pockets for Dogs, I am 100% confident that they are excellent. That's why I'm giving this product 5 stars. If Andie's pills were bigger I would get the Pill Pockets for Dogs, and I know she would like them just as much. For the time being, though, I will stick with the smaller Pill Pockets for Cats, since they last a few days longer. So, this review is to pass along an idea that perhaps some dog owners had not considered: If your dog takes tiny pills like Andie does, go with the more economical choice and get Pill Pockets for Cats. Your dog will never know the difference! …",116 out of 117 users found this review helpful

 Likely Product Mix,5,"I purchased the flavor mix pack a few months back. It wasn't from this link, but I assume this is the same product. I will agree that it is very frustrating they don't tell you exactly what it is. This is the review I posted - hope it helps. I just wanted to leave a note of what the composition of the Mixed Flavors pack looked like. I had a hard time finding information on what exactly I'd get. I'm sure they change could change this from time to time, but this is what I had: ""Roctane"" Gu packets (1 each): Blueberry Pomegranate, Vanilla Orange, Cherry Lime, Pineapple. These are the high endurance packets. The Blueberry Pom and Vanilla Orange are both double caffeine, Cherry Lime is normal caffeine and the Pineapple has no caffeine. Regular Gu Packets had 3 of Chocalate Outrage and Vanilla Bean. The rest had two of each flavor: Strawberry Banana, TriBerry, Expresso Love, Mandarin Orange, Jet Blackberry, Mint Chocolate, Lemon Sublime. The Strawberry Banana, Mint Chocolate, and Lemon Sublime have no caffeine, while Jet Blackberry and Expresso Love are double caffeine - everything else is normal caffeine. If you're looking to shake it up or find a favorite flavor, I think this is a good buy. I don't know that Gu is the best energy gel out there - I actually think everyone just has to find out what they like in taste and texture and what their stomach can handle. I've had good luck with Gu myself and I look forward to trying all the flavors. …",32 out of 32 users found this review helpful

Honey does not need a preservative or flavor enhancer, and it certainly doesn't need added fructose. If it is impossible to make a powdered or granulated product from honey, companies should just say so, and not market something as honey when it's really just 3/5 honey.

 The perfect rice for making sushi,5,"Kokuho Rose is a variety of medium-grained rice developed and grown in California by Koda Farms. It is very similar to Japanese rice (japonica), which is short-grained and fat. Introduced to the American market in 1963, it is well-suited for Japanese cuisine because it's very sticky and glutinous, having the same taste and texture as Japanese rice. It is a very popular choice for making sushi because it is relatively easy to find and inexpensive. To make sushi rice, the kernels have to be washed until the water is clear, then steamed. I use an electric rice cooker like SRG06FG 3-Cup Automatic Rice Cooker , but you can get fancier ones that cost upwards of $100. Cooked perfectly, the grains are firm, slightly elastic and have a shiny, pearl-like luster. You should be able to find this at your local Asian supermarket, as it is a widely distributed brand. Some bigger American supermarkets may also carry it. Another popular brand is Premium Rice . These are the two major brands I use and recommend.

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",33 out of 48 users found this review helpful
 Great Product In Wrong Container,5,"Undoubtedly, the purchase and use of stool softeners would plummet if everyone, including physicians, considered magnesium. Fact: An insufficient amount of magnesium in the body is a primary cause of constipation and hemorrhoids, yet most physicians unwittingly recommend stool softeners. Fact: By taking your measure of Natural CALM daily your constipation will quickly subside. Friends, before you devour any more medications why not try a natural remedy? Natural CALM is an easy-to-assimilate powder that when mixed with water becomes effervescent. More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM. Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars. Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage. Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: ""Place powder in a glass or mug,"" it says. ""Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water."" Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide. Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy. Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch. Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors? No fructose added. For further information call customer service at (866) 416-9216. Take charge of your health. Live life to the fullest. …",17 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 This one supplement has changed my life!!!!!,5,"I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.) None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life. That is, until Natural Calm. This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically! Here are the things this supplement has helped with: Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night. Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations. Mood--- Made me generally happier. Decreased muscle cramping and soreness. Improved gums and teeth. Improved hair loss. Improved digestion and transit time. Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too! But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really. There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Superstore if you want more science of magnesium.) I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement. If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want. Here's wishing you great health! …",37 out of 46 users found this review helpful

 Turkey matter that you can gobble anytime!,5,"There's something geniunely weird about turkey being called Shoulder of Pork and Ham. Obviously, it's not that. So what to call this stuff? Turkey Meat and Stuff? TUMS? Nope, that one's been taken. TWAM? Turkey Wing and Meat? Who knows what turkey parts are in here? I just assume that the really good turkeys are sold intact, with the innards removed, so there must be plenty of other parts we don't get to see, or turkeys that are not worth trying to sell intact, that goes into this lowest fat of all of the famous and legandary SPAM product. The good news is that it's way easier to slice than a real turkey, and you can cook it in a few minutes. And yes, I really recommend slicing and browning this stuff in a frying pan. Otherwise it does sort of resemble cat food. Personally, I'm experimenting with shifting my breakfast toward protein and away from fat and carbs so won't be tempted to eat a huge lunch in the middle of the day when my job is basically sitting and moving a mouse around. So, I gave this a try and if you fry it a bit it isn't bad. It's sort of like going to Arby's without getting in the car.

" Great company, good food... but could be better",4,"First off, I have very little doubt that Newman's Own wet cat food is an excellent and healthy choice to feed one's cat. Feeding a cat a quality food, even if expensive compared to other catfoods, is worthwhile and if it prevents one health problem might even pay for itself. For those reasons, and because I support Newman's ideals in general, my cat has had the pleasure of enjoying many cans of Newman's food. However, in comparison to other cat foods in this price range, my cat does have a couple of complaints. I should mention that my cat LOVES to eat, it is his primary motivation in life. Need him to take a pill? Just coat it in wet food and drop it in his dish. But, because he likes to eat so much, he must also have controlled portions - 1/3 can, twice a day. And that leads to his first complaint. Open a can of Newman's, and there is a lot of empty space, around the food and even large open cracks in the food. There certainly isn't the volume of solid food in a 5.5 oz can of Newman's compared to the competition. The second complaint: Newman seems to love his brown rice, which is ok, but he keeps the grains big and whole. My cat loves food, and cleans his dish every time... but he usually eats right around those big grains of rice. Basically, my cat isn't getting as much food from a can of Newman's as from his favorite brands (Nature's Logic and Innova EVO), so we'll be cutting Newman out of the rotation. …",38 out of 38 users found this review helpful

 Works Great with our Ameda and Medela Pumps!!,5,"We bought these bottles to use with our Medela PIS and Ameda Purley Yours Breast Pumps, yes, we bought both.

 Gold standard...Years of research on my part...,5,"When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my ""baby"" each day. Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life... I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption. I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me) At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud. Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods. The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label. Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this! Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic. I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about. Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out... (p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them! But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!) So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.) Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest... if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal. This is hard to find. So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet. He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!) I, personally, have helped friends CURE ""health"" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept ""treating"" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and ""cured"" them! Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both. I am a raving fan. and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it. …",119 out of 120 users found this review helpful

 **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************,2,"First off, the initial arrival: It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat! Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary. Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective; 1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces 2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several. 3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging. In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags. Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's. Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way. But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Superstore charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping). If you wanted to buy using Superstore Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.

 Mild sweet tea,5,I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose. Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth. I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea. Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening. …,24 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 Not Good...,3,"The soup base is disgusting. I ordered this with high hopes on all the rave 5 star reviews. I'm sorry people, but you have some messed up taste buds if you think this is the best ramen you ever had. It taste very strange, like seaseme seed oil. It smells terrible. I should have never order this product and continued to order Nong Shim's Shin Ramyun. I really don't recommend anyone actually drink broth for It's a very thick dark fluid that stains anything it touches. It will probably damage your liver. Not to mention all the sodium and MSG.

 So Good why isn't it Bad???,5,"After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked **** hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend! The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else. First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right. Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches. It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the ""bowl"" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked. I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too. All in all, I highly recommend them! Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway. Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this! PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Superstore I've found a site called ""netrition "" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Superstore is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food. I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Superstore charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Superstore, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them. So like I said, Superstore is great for most things, but when it comes to food, Netrition is a whole lot better! …",26 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 Cracker? Cookie? Either Way -- Delicious.,5,"CRACKER COOKIE BISCUIT BLISS I'd call these tiny snacks cookies rather than crackers, based on sheer yumminess, but they aren't especially sweet, and I suppose if they want to call them crackers, that is their prerogative. PACKAGING Kudos for putting them in a bag rather than in a bag inside an unnecessary box as is usual for products in this segment. TASTE & TEXTURE The taste is appropriately peanutty, somewhat salty and slightly sweet. It brought back childhood memories of Cap'n Crunch Peanut Butter Crunch Cereal. The texture is somewhat similar to shortbread -- crumbly with the slightest hint of (pleasant) buttery oiliness, which I imagine is coming from peanut ingredients and not from dairy butter (since it doesn't contain butter). INGREDIENTS & HEALTH CLAIMS The ingredients are all pronounceable and recognizable as food. Things you may actually have in your home. Phenomenal. They don't really make any health claims, sticking with 'all natural' and 'no additives', neither of which I would disagree with on the basis of the extremely short ingredient list. Calorically you could do much worse in the prepackaged snack cookie/cracker segment, but this is still a snack food. RECIPE POSSIBILITIES I can see creative cooks using these treats in all sorts of interesting ways -- as a pie crust, in lieu of graham crackers perhaps? As part of a trail mix or dessert bar? If you have used these treats in your cooking I'd love to hear about it in the comments section. :) IT'S FOR YOU IF... - You love peanuts/peanut butter - You prefer products with ingredients you don't need to look up on wikipedia - You like some salty with your sweet (or sweet with your salty) THINK TWICE IF... - You have a peanut allergy (sorry, I know sort of obvious) - You are expecting tiny, soft, peanut butter cookies - You honestly think you can stop eating after 27 very tiny crackers (1 serving) …",45 out of 45 users found this review helpful
 Are You Kidding Me??,1,"I just finished watching this train wreck and I had to warn anyone who's considering buying this to stay far far away. I read every review just like you're doing now, looking for something different and was fooled into thinking this film would be something special. After viewing this I was left disappointed and frustrated. I have one question for all the glowing reviewers...What the hell were you watching?? It's not quality moviemaking! The script was weak, the plot was dragged out way too long, it took 52 minutes before anyone was killed. Factor in a poor musical score and sound transfer, topped off by sub-par to mediocre acting and you have an amatuer film. As far as special effects go, just fast forward to the last 15 minutes for what little this movie this has offer. This movie reminds me of a college student film gone wrong. To put it bluntly, if this film scared you, you're a P@$$Y! If Superstore offered this for free and just charged you shipping, you paid too much.

 They are THIS good!,5,"I was really glad to receive this case of cans of black beans from Superstore, because the cold winter is starting out here in the desert, especially over night, and I thought it would be great to have some warm black beans for lunch at work. So far this warm year I have been eating for lunch cold Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12) mixed with Mori-Nu Silken Extra Firm Tofu, 24 pack and other stuff at hand, but the cold nights and days make me want something warm instead. When I lived in Guatemala back a quarter century ago, we had black beans and tortilla, hand made, so this sounded really nice. As soon as the case came, I got out a can at night to simmer with diced onion, garlic and a few cumin seeds, to warm to work the next day. Round midnight, I got up to check the beans, still warming,and smelling great. I decided to try half a spoonful to see if they were all right. They smelled way too fresh. One half spoonful led to another, and soon the whole pot was gone. They were THAT good! So anyway, next day I had the usual garbanzo and tofu salad, with fresh lemon juice, and will go now to see if I get some black beans ready for lunch tomorrow! They really are great: good texture, very fresh, and the taste very fresh. After using this brand name for so long, I can trust its uniformity, with no surprises from batch to batch, all of the highest quality. I know some people might say, dude, it's black beans, bake your own, dried from a bag! But the freshness of these apparently never dried beans is something ""to die for!"" or rather, to live for . . . Great beans. Won't let you down. Will fill you up! And good for you too in every kind of way. Soul food as well as food for the body. Highly recommended! …",28 out of 31 users found this review helpful

 Best nonfat dry milk powder ever consumed,5,"When one reconstitutes this milk powder with purified water to remove the herbicides and other pest controls building up from Genetically Modified herbicide tolerant crops, they will find this tastes just like the fresh milk from Organic Valley's family of small farmers across the country. Reconstitution means a good job blending in a blender, not just stirred, because this is non instant powdered milk. It will take a bit longer to prepare, but the taste is worth it. I will not purchase herbicide tolerant crops for my family. Yet, the USDA and the Obama Monsanto Administration has deregulated soy, corn, cotton, canola, sugar beets, and alfalfa (the latter of which needed no herbicides previously) to be incessantly sprayed with Roundup and other dangerous weed killers. This means that the crop fed to dairy cows, horses, and other livestock will be contaminated with foreign organisms (not plants unlike hybrids) to make a patentable plant which Monsanto owns for the purpose of forcing farmers to spray more Roundup, so more money can be made by Monsanto. Less than 7 percent of all alfalfa had been sprayed with herbicides previously. But, all that will change if the dairy industry purchases GMO seeds for alfalfa. Our potable water supplies all over the country are becoming contaminated, although studies have been blocked by Monsanto. Where studies were done in other countries, like Denmark, it was found that extremely high levels of Roundup (or Glyphosate, the trademark for the active ingredient) were building up in the potable groundwater. AND, they are not planting GMO seeds, unlike the USA. Because of their studies, they have instructed the Danish farmers not to spray with Roundup for at least 3 years. But, in the USA, farmers are instructed to read labels and are taught to use chemical intensive agriculture; studies are blocked from being published, and even physicians are not given the right to know. In Taiwan, a study was done on 93 persons who tried to commit suicide by ingesting Roundup. The symptoms were very much like gastrointestinal reflux disease that has affected people all over the USA who have consumed heavily sprayed Roundup Ready (and GMO) crops. Even babies have GERD and the causes are unknown because studies have been blocked by Monsanto. Monsanto's presence has been at the USDA, and Michael Taylor, first a lobbyist, then the company's Vice President, was appointed to the US-FDA by the first President Bush and has been there ever since. Myriad Monsanto employees are at the FDA and EPA making policy and their policy only benefits their company, not our health or the health of our children. Where studies have been done outside the USA, researchers and physicians have found growing levels of new allergens, toxins, new diseases, and nutritional problems with GMO plants. Organic Valley is committed to growing the best alfalfa for their cows and for that reason, and since organic agriculture prohibits use of GMO seeds, I'm buying all the Organic Valley powdered nonfat dry skim milk I can find with its long shelf life. I will not give my family GMO milk. We will stop drinking and eating dairy products, once all milk contains GMO's because pollinators carry them from crop to crop or the wind blows the pollen well beyond the six mile limit claimed by the USDA. We will buy Organic Valley but not heavily sprayed herbicide tolerant GMO alfafa fed dairy products. …",14 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Simply the best tea I ever drank,5,"I just received this tea after waiting only 2 days, that is amazing. I could not wait to try it so I followed the other reviewers' advice and washed it first. Etc. Etc. Now I am not saying anyone is wrong by any means but I tried it both ways, washing and not washing and I cannot tell the difference. To me I believe it is a waste of tea to wash it, in fact I found a lovely video that may be very interesting to some of you it is only 5 minutes this man is Dr. Tea he has written a book and has a shop and sells teas. He is basically an expert and he does not wash his tea. [...] I did however make a nice ritual out of the making of the tea. I had the opportunity to purchase an authentic tea pot along with all the extras that I found is needed to make a good tea, I got it from China Town in California, and I used it the proper way for the first time today, it was relaxing and fun. I was not aware of all the health properties in this particular tea, the list is impressive, heart problems, high blood pressure, cholesterol, it helps with teeth and gum problems and promotes its healing, it is also a weight reduction tea, but what I needed it for is the Theanine that is in this tea, I have an autoimmune disease that causes inner tremors and I take L-theanine to calm me down but this tea is doing that in a more natural way. I will no longer be needing to purchase this supplement. This also is a tea that has very little caffeine and it did not make me nervous like the average teas do. I do recommend this tea to everyone especially if you have any of these problems, but for me I enjoyed a very restful day without any jitters. As for the cost, this morning I cut off 2 grams of the tea and I am just finishing it, you can brew this tea many many times as you can see in the video, this makes it, for me, a very inexpensive tea. It will last forever even if I use it on a daily basis which I now intend to do. …",24 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 Something's Changed with Canidae food,1,"I fed and recommended this food for several years as one of the best dry foods available. However, over the last few months (late 2007) something has changed. My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it. Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped. I tried another bag last week-- same results. Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months. No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners. Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address. I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems. I've changed my dogs to Eagle Pack Holistic Selects. It's more expensive, but they are back to their old selves-- healthy, no digestive troubles, and great coats. …",15 out of 18 users found this review helpful

Newman's is what I would make if I were making it for my own family, as in you can trust that it is great tasting, good for you and safe to eat.

While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog. One other finding: When you open almost any moist dog food you smell ""dog food"".

I prepared it cold, and look, I sucked this down, and then I cleaned the bathroom in a single bound, I did! As a hot drink, it's also delightful - you literally just mix it as you would any hot powdered drink like a cocoa. I highly suggest a whisk, and do it well, and you get the best results. This mix really has a smooth mocha flavor. I've been drinking it hot in my morning cappuccino - I whisk one or two scoop into some hot water to mix, then a shot of espresso and then top it off with steamed unsweetened soy milk, and it makes an AMAZING morning cup.

 Good Product and Excellent Customer Service,5,"At first, we did not get along. It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements. Good coarse grind, check. No grounds around lid before closing, check. Not too full, check. Seated properly in Keurig, check. My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help. I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews. The next morning, we tried something different. We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine. That helped, a lot. The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine. Perfection! I cannot explain why, but it worked. I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail! We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean. We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.

 Disappointing,1,"When you first receive this basket you think wow this looks great. However once you open it you start to realize how not great it is. 1. The most weird thing about this basket is that they items have been repackaged. There is a box of carmel corn the cover made it look like it was a fake version of the item. When you open it up you are even more suspicious b/c the caramel corn is inside a wheat thins box! huh? many of the items are similarly repackaged this way. I would never send someone a basket that is so obviously homemade instead of a legit company. 2. many of the items were so small. Inside was a tiny box of jelly beans, a one serving of peanuts, cashews etc. I am use to seeing in baskets a can of nuts not a single serving snack travel pack. Also some of the items were a little strange to me - German hot mustard in a green tube...it didn't seem to match the caramel corn, jelly beans, nuts and crackers. There was a package of sausage but still... 3. never heard of the brands -- now this could just be me. these may be very famous brands and people know them all over the world. But with the suspect packaging I thought the food itself was also of a lower class. After tasting the items such as the caramel corn - which was stale, Hit cookies which were blah an oreo is better, and the malt shop taffies not very tasty, my disappointment just grew. I would not recommend this product to anyone. you could build a better basket on your own or go with a well known company. **EDIT** after I wrote this review Black Mountian now ig4U sent me a new basket. It was packaged so much better. It didn't look scary fake like the first one did. I appreciate the company's effort to make right something that was not good.

 Convenience Store Cappuccino,2,"I was so excited to see this product (Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino) for my beloved Keurig. I usually brew flavored coffee into a mug of heated milk & a touch of sugar. I thought this would be a step faster & a step up from my usual morning cup. I was dismayed to read that the first ingredient is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but I figured I'd make the small nutritional sacrifice in the name of morning caffeine happiness. Well, it turns out the taste is nothing like a true cappuccino, but almost identical to a convenience store (7/11) machine cappuccino. If you love that flavor, you'll love this k-cup. I thought those instant-flavored coffees were GREAT when I was a college student!) Another complaint about this new k-cup is that the box suggests you run a hot water cycle (sans k-cup) after making the cappuccino. I presume this is to rinse out any dairy or sugar product which could muck up your machine. I'm glad for the tip, but wish I didn't have to run down the water in my reservoir. I'd hate to throw this coffee out, so this morning I brewed a cup of this and then followed it with a plain coffee k-cup. It isn't as sweet and has more ""real"" coffee in it, but it still tastes very artificial.

 AH-MAZING!!,5,"WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now! SUCH a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more! …",84 out of 87 users found this review helpful
 Avoid using in Shakes/Drinks,2,"Although the product claims to be a viable additive for shakes/drinks, our experience is it won't dissolve without a blender. Simply put it clumps. The taste is fine, actually good, so my recommendation is to look elsewhere for a drink supplement. …",20 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Directly opposed to previous review,5,"I'm giving these a 5-star rating specifically because they are not vegetarian. This is to counteract the fact that somebody gave them a 1-star rating for the same reason. Also, they are delicious. So is steak. …",19 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 Became an instant favorite!,5,"It is indeed a ""rich and creamy chocolaty delight"" if you use the smallest cup size on your machine. Remember to shake the box well before using. Some cocoa still remains in the K-cup after brewing, but regardless, you get a very satisfying cup of hot cocoa! …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 wrong item,2,"I ordered this to give as a gift. I rec'd the package, opened it up and it was completely the wrong thing. Haribo had mislabled the box and what I rec'd was 5 lbs. of sugar coated gummy apples instead. I was very diappointed although Superstore was very understanding and refunded me the total amount. I hesitate to order this item again. …",2 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 snack food heaven,5,"These are wonderful! They're definitely chocolate, but not overpowering. The sea salt provides a nice foil, so you can eat a whole bag by yourself without going into a chocolate coma (maybe that's bad). They're just sweet enough to make the chocolate happen. They're like ""hint of oreo"" without all the garbage and without all the guilt (unless you eat a whole bag in one sitting). I've had them with a peach salsa, which was nice. I think they'd go really well with a fresh fruit salad. They'd go well with ice cream, and they're perfect with a tart, plain yogurt. I dipped them in hummus too, and while it doesn't not work...I'm not sure it's great. Still, basically they're versatile and not too bad for you. When you find yourself at the bottom of the bag you can always say, ""well, at least it wasn't a bag of oreos."" …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Fiber-riffic!,5,"Have you ever described a food as tasting ""healthy"" when you mean it tastes so bad it must be good for you? Fear not! It is pleasantly adaptable to use with any fruit on hand. I honestly will say, though, that it does have an earthy quality. It may take the uninitiated some getting acquainted with--just a little! If trying for the first time, I heartily recommend trying the Hemp Goddess Supreme recipe on the jar's label. Surprisingly palatable! You'll be proud to have done something nourishing and healthy for yourself. Easy to digest. The powder is indeed rather coarse. When you find it'll tide you over very well until your next meal, you won't mind. Including this in one's eating habits can only be an addition for the positive. …",30 out of 31 users found this review helpful
 Super Delicious,5,"There are no special nutritional needs in my family, but these were on sale, so I bought them. THEY ARE AWESOME!!!!!!
