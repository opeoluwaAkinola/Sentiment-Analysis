 You get what you pay for - Quality worth every penny spent,5,"This product is everything you would expect, and then some. The shipping was fast. The Matcha is sent in a resealable, heavy-duty FOILED plastic bag, EXCELLENT quality. I recommend using a small tin for everyday use, taking no more than an ounce or two from the larger bag, to preserve the flavor and freshness. The taste is WONDERFUL. Very fresh, very green, very subtle, yet intense. I purchased this product after Starbucks raised their prices (again!), because I had become a frozen green tea frappucino addict...Now I am just a Matcha addict. I love it in the evening warm, in a large mug with a good splash of milk, and simply adore it from the blender with milk, ice cubes, some vanilla syrup and a splash of whipping cream for the frothy, creamy taste... I use 2 level teaspoons, not packed, to a 20 oz. mug, so figure 1 teaspoon per ""regular"" coffee cup. The illustrative picture is what your matcha will look like. None of the other vendors show the color/quality of their product...For something like this, being able to see what you will get is half the issue. I can tell you that the flavor, which is the other half, is also the quality you would expect and wish for. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Not Exactly What I am Used To,3,"This is NOT your European buckweat kasha that we love and used to cook it for years with an absolute consistency: wash, add water, and boil until it's absorbed.

 Bulk Bag of Stale Paragon Popcorn,1,"I ordered the bulk 12.5 lb bag of Paragon popcorn on August 12, 2011, thinking that it was reasonable priced and would go well with the microwave popper and the air popper I was also ordering from Superstore. Some Reviewers had noted that what they had received was stale; they were right, the popcorn tasted alfully funny and barely popped in the microwave popper, at least a third of what I had cooked were unpopped duds. In the air popper, I did get better results, but still had a lot of partially popped kernels (aka, ""tooth breakers"" as I had to be extreemly careful at the bottom of the bowl). I was going to try making a batch tonight, I noticed a dark kernel in the mix; it had mold on it. Some of the other kernels look suspecious, too; my overall impression of the cooked corn, and the weathered plastic bag the entire 12.5 lb batch came in, is that it's completly stale and too old to use. I expect 12.5 lb bags of corn are not selling that fast, and are getting stale in the warehouse. Anyone who wants a decent bag of popping corn would be better off just picking-up a bag at the grocery store; at least those bags are freshness-labeled with a date, this Paragon corn was complely undated and no telling how old it was. Terrible!! **UPDATE** 11-OCT-2011 - I tossed all the stale Paragon corn last week in the trash, decided it wasn't worth dealing with if it was moldy, stale, and wouldn't completly pop. Last weekend, I tried a new *freshness dated* bag of Kroger yellow popping corn in my new air popper; that did perfect, there were about 5 unpopped kernels remaining (compared to the over two dozen unpopped kernnels from the Paragon corn). No more unsealed food products from Superstore for me after this experience. …",24 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 6 y/o & 2 y/o love them,5,"I love the organic ingredients & portability. They love the taste. Every flavor we have tried so far has been a hit - grape, strawberry, sour apple (think granny smith - just tart enough but not really sour), mixed berry & tropical. A winner all around for us in the snack catagory. Price here on Superstore is very, very good compared to my grocery store where you can buy these individually for about a dollar each. I think you can also find these at Starbucks for about the same dollar a piece if you want to try before buying. I find them to be very similar to Stretch Island fruit strips in both flavor, texture & stickiness. Not too sticky for eating out, but wet wipes always come in handy! We used to be on the subscribe program for a monthly delivery for additional savings, but the 4 variety pack is no longer in stock & this one isn't being offered on S&S. (Which is a darned shame!)

" Less Stress, Better Sleep, Great Product",5,"This is an excellent source of magnesium which provides a number of health benefits. Some obvious and some not so obvious. I have trouble sleeping, waking up many times at night and like everybody else I deal with my fair share of stress. I take a 1/2 teaspoon at night about an hour before bed time along with 5-htp and phenibut powder, Powder 10 Grams + FREE Primaforce Phenibut Powder 100 Grams . I started taking the magnesium long before the 5-htp or anything else, taking them together definitely enhances the mood and sleep stabilizing effects, if that's what your looking for. The Raspberry Lemon flavor doesn't taste delicious but it certainly does not taste bad so it is not a chore what-so-ever to drink a glass each night before going to bed.

 Terrific dietary supplement and entertainment value in one!,5,"Let's be honest - 35% of your recommended daily fiber in a ""candy bar"" that makes you want to eat the whole box is great thing. 13% of your saturated fats in one bar? Not so good. I believe it balances out for the most part and there is definitely a benefit to making fiber taste good. Just don't eat more than one until you are used to them. The chicory root fiber that is in these (and FiberOne) and every other clone product is an incredible generator of intestinal gas in many people. People who eat a lot of foods high in fiber will not likely be as affected, but some will be caught quite by surprise with what happens a couple of hours after you eat one. Reports of people scaring their pets and waking themselves and loved ones up from a sound sleep with the substantial and epic flatulence is not as exaggerated as you might think. Marathon farting with longer durations and louder volume than you have ever experienced is fairly common. The good news is, the gaseous emanations are very often ""all bark and no bite"" (to put it delicately) and so can be very entertaining if you have small children or an immature husband (or wife). Just do not eat them prior to bed, church, yoga class, boardroom meetings, dates, long car trips with passengers, crowded movies, using public transportation, job interviews, dentist appointments, doctor's appointments, family reunions ... well, you get the picture. However, if you get selected by the IRS for an audit, eat a whole box (5 of them) about 1 hour before the scheduled time. This also works for meetings with any government officials or any people you DO NOT wish to ever invite you back. …",30 out of 31 users found this review helpful

 They changed the Chips now they taste horrible,1,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy. I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan. About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket. I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it. After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to. They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed. So I e-mailed Kettle with the following: ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering."" I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag. This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks. Please let me know if I can be of any more help."" Well the next bag was good. Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost. I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company. So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle. Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand. increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand. Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same... …",20 out of 27 users found this review helpful

 MAMMA MIA!!!!,5,"Wow, I DID NOT EXPECT such a quick, shocking result from this product, but it definitely delivers!!! My brother told me about these tablets and the ""flavor tripping"" parties. I had never heard of them before, but decided to give it a try just because the claim sounded so wildly strange, a sort of ""Ripley's Believe it or not"" kind of novelty.

I poured a spoonful of white vinegar in a small glass of water... SWEET... I haven't tried beer or other things, but sooner or later I will! The best thing I see coming out of this is that I FINALLY don't need to sweeten my tea! I'll just squeeze a lemon in and that will be that.

 Does what it claims. Very bright.,5,"This is one of those nice things that you rarely find: a consumer product that does exactly what it advertises it will do. It's trivial to set up, requires almost no maintenance, and rapidly grows plants without you having to know anything about how to grow plants: just follow the very simple directions and the plants grow. I started mine with the Salad Greens kit instead of the included herbs kit, as honestly I don't cook with a lot of fresh herbs but I do like a nice salad. It's growing very rapidly and I'm pleased. The hardware seems sturdy. One important factor to understand before buying is that it's really, incredibly bright. Photos make it look like the unit emits a cheery glow... more like it emits bright daylight that fills the entire room about 17 hours a day. It's a bit like having the sun on your table. It's rather startling at first and takes a little getting used to, but after a day or two it's okay, as long as you've placed it somewhere that it won't bother you to have very bright light. I notice that they sell wall units on which you can place up to three Aerogardens. I can barely imagine how bright the room would be after installing three of these things in one place. I certainly wouldn't want any more lighting in the room. I might even put a screen in front of it to soften the light. …",35 out of 37 users found this review helpful
 Best Food next to raw food diet...,5,"When my husband saved our first little kitten from being mauled by a dog we just ran to the store and grabbed some IAMS kitten. He would gorge himself on it and then throw up. All he did was go to the bathroom....he pooed like 5 times a day. He always seemed hungry despite all the eating. By then we had bought a Maine **** and I switched them to a raw food diet, which was great except it was to rich for our first kitty. I finally went back and forth between EVO and Orijen. Evo is great but gave my cats sticky poo. Orijen is number one in my book. My cats have been eating it since they were about 3 months old (that's over a year now). They have NEVER thrown up or had a hair ball. They hardly shed. They have glossy coats....and they are REALLY active. They don't lay around and sleep all day. They are constantly moving and playing. This food is amazing. And they only eat 1/3c. twice a day and it's more than enough. Sometimes there is food left in the bowl. They absolutely love the taste of it. It's more expensive but a big bag lasts my two cats 7-8 weeks. That's about 20-25 dollars a month on cat food. Not bad considering you will save on vet bills. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Perfect!,5,"This one is well thought out - perfect in every way! I threw my old ""My K-cup"" out in the trash. Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little? Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly. I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says ""some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.

 AWFUL- AWFUL- NASTY- HORRIBLE,1,"Do your research on this... the main ingredients are chemicals, ie propylene glycol. I got my 4 bottles from Superstore... opened one bottle, squirted some into a tall glass of ice cold water and could not wait... well... EEKKKKK... so gross. It tasted like pure sugar water with a weird aftertaste, squirted some more and finally got the ""hint"" of tea taste... You have to squirt A LOT to even taste a hint of tea and when the main ingredients are chemicals (excluding water of course) it tastes like what it is.. A CHEMICAL. I immediately put the bottle back into the box from Superstore, along with the 3 unopened bottles and tossed them in the garbage. While I hated to spend $12+ of my money for NOTHING.. it's my fault, I should have done reviews FIRST. Here's just one I found: [...] The cute bottle and the 0 calories in the commercials were enough to entice me and I am sure this product will make millions from idiots like me who fell for this, but trust me people, SAVE YOUR MONEY. I don't write much reviews, but I just had to come on here because I am trying to go green and avoid as many chemicals as I can for my own body and home and this is just one big giant chemical hidden in a cute bottle with a great commercial. Look up the ingredients, which are NOT on Superstore and do your own research. Pour a glass of water, squeeze some lemons and add stevia for some lemonade with no chemicals.... Or brew some tea bags, put in pitcher, refrigerate, add stevia for some sweet tea... it will be better for you and taste better than this ****. Lesson learned...

 My cats love Taste of the Wild,5,"My 2-year old cat Ezekiel, adopted from a shelter 3 months ago, will eat NOTHING but Taste of the Wild dry food. My first choice would be a raw-food diet, but I'm too lazy to keep that up except for supplementing. However, Ezekiel won't eat fresh salmon, chicken, chicken liver, beef, or anything fresh. He won't eat any other high-quality cat food dry or wet. He won't eat any cheap store brand. It's Taste of the Wild or starve. I am comfortable with this formula because of what I have read, and because he is thriving, healthy, and has an especially shiny coat and is in altogether top-notch shape. Yet, since I believe wet or raw food is best for cats (I had a cat who required a PU after repeated bladder infections and who re-blocked whenever he had any dry food), no matter how high quality the dry food, I was eager to buy the canned food. At first, Ezekiel turned up his nose at it as he does at all food except Taste of the Wild Dry. Then, we got a new 12-week old girl kitten, Ariel. She is teaching him all sorts of adventurous things. Is she does it, he does it (and vice-versa). She LOVES it, ergo HE loves it. Now they both lap it up quickly, and I'm thrilled that they are eating good food.

 What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical,1,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands. This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi. Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering. The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much. While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal. Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products. Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money). Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer. One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables.

 Just about instant gratification,5,"I received as a Christmas gift. Had never heard of it, but my son just KNEW I'd love it. Set-up was very quick. Easy to follow instructions with pics. All the herbs sprouted in the time frame printed on the pod. (Beware the basil placement as it LEAPS ahead of the rest - perhaps a side spot vs center where it hogs all the light). I month later, I have LOADS of herbs, some of which I'm using and some that I'm drying for later use. You need to top off the water to the fill line and add the provided nutrient tabs every other week. (A light comes on to warn you). You can program the light to give your plants the needed 8 hrs of dark. The grow light is VERY bright, so I suggest choosing your home placement carefully.

 Artificial sweetner in product,1,"I bought this believing it was an all natural product. When I took my first sip I thought it tasted artificial and after researching discovered that it contained sucralose. It is deceptive not to include this information prominently on the packaging when claiming all natural flavoring. In fact I did not see it mentioned anywhere unless you read the ingredient list, where it is easy to confuse the 'sucralose' with 'sucrose' -a natural sugar. The advertising on the package claims to be unsweetened. Not true, it is sweetened with an artificial sweetner. This is the product description on Superstore: ""We start with pure, natural water, add carbonation and 100% fruit essences to create 10 distinctly thirst-quenching flavors."" Very misleading. …",12 out of 19 users found this review helpful

I modify it to make various kinds of cakes: coconut cake, red velvet cake, etc. It always gets rave reviews, even from those used to eating wheat-based cakes. (My mom & sister can tolerate vanilla pudding, so I add one third to half a box of instant vanilla pudding - regular, not sugar free - per bag of cake mix to make it extra moist.)

 I've Got A Case of the Hershey Squirts...,3,"Oh, c'mon grow up...I happen to call Hershey Kisses, Hershey Squirts...y'know, as in small...which exactly what Hershey Kisses are; small yet incredibly satisfying and I just bought myself a 25lb case to prove how much I love them. Of course, I don't eat too many of them because then I really will have a case of the you-know-what's... So you might ask yourself, ""Why would anyone in their right mind buy a 25lb case of Hershey Kisses?"" And I got a good answer for you, I don't know. Chocolics do weird things. It seemed like a good idea at the time. I think I was just reasoning with myself how I wouldn't have to keep driving to the store and picking up a bag of my favorite treats...now I had a whole case and suddenly they didn't look so appealing...in fact, at one time I could have sworn that they were mocking me! Yeah, these things were getting me into trouble... It was a very hot Southern California afternoon a few weeks back and I was innocently watering the plants in my front yard and it was hot, y'know, so I didn't have a shirt on. I see the neighbor kid walking down the sidewalk and I just say, ""Hey, kid...want some candy?"" So he says, ""Yeah!"" I run in the house real fast and I give him a bag of foil wrapped chocolate magic and he looks like he just hit pay dirt. He runs into his house and says, ""MOM! The nice man without a shirt on just gave me some candy!!!!"" Next thing I know, the cops are at my house. I didn't know why but all I could think of saying, ""Boy, officer, do I have some sweet kisses for you!"" The next thing I knew, I was in the patrol car with the cop saying, ""Oh, you're going to fit right in with the rest of the sickos..."" My wife came to bail me out and she said that she would've gotten there sooner but she tripped over a 25lb case of Hershey Kisses and sprained her ankle. A lot of people speculate if there really is such a thing as too much of a good thing. I would have to say, yes, yes, there is. Stick with the smaller, more manageable bags. Don't go crazy.

 Good product but hardens over time,5,"I am not experiencing any difficulties with dissolve rates with this product. Ideally you would have both this little shaker canister plus the individual packets because when adding to a drink the packets are convenient but when whipping up some tasty dessert or, as I have been doing lately, making a batch of coleslaw dressing, being able to dip a half teaspoon into the canister is easier and neater than opening a bunch of packets. If I could only have one though I'd have the canisters. It's a great product that I am very thankful for. Update - I have discovered a reason to buy the packets instead. I found last night that the remaining powder in the canister I've been using has hardened to a solid impenatrable rock. No amount of jabbing with fork or pointy knife will break it up. The lid was closed tight so it wasn't because of that. I suppose I could add some distilled water to see if it will make liquid stevia out of my petrified product. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful

I hadn't expected much from instant espresso based on past experience with instant coffees. This is actually very good. I have only used it for lattes and mochas. I don't do espresso by the shot.

 MUCH better than low-fat dried milk!,5,"This is a review from Marc's wife: I have throughly tested this Product. Order this exact one: Nestle Nido makes a confusing array of products with similar names and labels! Con:Taste not IDENTICAL to whole milk! Pro:Dissolves easily, smells good. -Tried this as creamer in tea with sugar-a person used to whole milk in his tea thought it tasted fine. -in cooking- tried it in my favorite pancake recipe-no perceived difference. -tried using it as substitute for milk in a couple of sauces: no complaints from anyone, I thought it tasted slighty low-fat. Certainly in a cheese or other highly flavored sauce should be fine. -substituted for half the non-fat dried milk in our instant hot cholate mix recipe. Everyone raved about the flavor! I noticed our mix wasn't being used up at the same phenomenal clip as people professed themselves more satisfied. - Perfect for single people who want small amounts of milk, mostly for creamer in hot beverages. If you're going to use it slowly, maybe put in a glass jar in the fridge. - Disaster supplies;earthquake,hurricane,etc. - save on gasoline! Won't have to make trips for the sole purpose of someone having milk in their coffee or cereal! - Camping,etc. where weight is an issue;bring this powder and reconstitute as needed. Buy it-you will love it! If two cans seems a big quantity for you, give/resell the other one to a friend,neighbor,etc. NEW ADVANTAGES_ADDED 8-01-11 -Easier to use in cooking than liquid milk- in any recipe where it calls for scalding and then cooling the milk, you can skip that step by just mixing up the amount of milk used in your recipe from the milk powder and lukewarm water. Faster and saves on pots needed too. -Absolutely ESSENTIAL if you make yougurt at home. Milk solids are added to milk in making yougurt to stiffen the milk so the resulting yougurt will have the texture people have come to expect from store-bought yogurt.By using this whole milk powder instead of nonfat milk powder, the yougurt thickens better, and it tastes better-for the best yogurt you have ever eaten, try homemade yogurt made with whole milk AND this whole milk powder!! …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 The best tasting waffle mix that you can buy.,5,"I first heard about Golden Malted Waffle mix here on Superstore when I was searching for a new waffle maker and saw that on pratically every maker this mix was recommended. After reading up on the mix and finding out that it is the same mix served at various hotels across the country, I decided to give it a try. I have to tell you that this is the best waffle mix I have ever had. From the moment you open the first canister and you get that malt smeel hits your nose, you know that this is going to be good. The flavor is great and it is not an overly sweet batter which makes it good for both breakfast and for using for dessert waffles with ice cream and fruit. Also I recommend using milk in place of the water when making the waffle batter. It makes for a much better waffle. So if you are on the fence about trying this mix do yourself a favor and order. You will not be disappointed. …",82 out of 84 users found this review helpful

" The Perfect K-cup, 40 Years in the Making",5,"First of all, yes, it is expensive. Though currently at $59.99 for a 54 ct, the price is not part of my review. I'm sure it'll come down eventually. I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now. As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend. Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill. I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1. The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor. 2. I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place. There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago. It is THE perfect medium blend. There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers. It's bright, but not too bright. Does the K-cup version do it justice? Yes. Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup. I just got home with these an hour ago, and 3 cups later, I can honestly say my prayers have been answered. You know what? Even at $59.99, this review would be 5 stars. It's that good. …",12 out of 15 users found this review helpful

I'm surprised at the price here, you can get this item at Target for $1.09 per pouch which is much less expensive. I guess buying it online is helpful for people who don't have access to a Target or Health food store, and in that case, is worth the price. *** as a special precaution *** A baby food recall just issued by the FDA (Jan. 2010) may have some of the most stomach-churning details I've read in awhile: ""Swollen or leaking pouches may indicate problems with the product, including possible contamination by bacteria that can cause illness, or that the packaging has been compromised and is at risk of bacterial contamination."" The recalled food is made by Happy Baby, and it's a mix of the baby and toddler lines that parents should be throwing out. The recall covers: * HAPPYTOT Green bean, pear & peas, NET WT. 4.22 OZ.

 Flor-Essence Worked for Us - Cancer Free,5,"My husband has taken the Flor-Essence tea since 1996 when he was initially diagnosed with Stage 2 prostate cancer. After being diagnosed with the cancer in 1995, he underwent radiation therapy. At the time, it appeared the radiation was successful since his PSA levels were normal. As you might imagine, we were both ecstatic about this. However, this happiness was short-lived. In 1996, a follow up PSA test showed the PSA level had started to increase. His urologist said this was not good believing the radiation did not get all of the cancer. After consulting with a local health food expert, I started my husband on the Flor-Essence tea, Flora Pro-Essence (specifically for the prostate), and modified citrus pectin (known to kill cancer cells). During an exam, his urologist told us after reviewing his PSA level (now normal), ""I don't what you are doing, but whatever it is it's working."" Fifteen years later and still taking all three products, my husband remains cancer free and his PSA levels normal. We sincerely believe by taking these products it literally saved his life. The tea is a natural, gentle cleansing product which also helped him more easily recover from the serious side effects of the radiation therapy. I also take the Flor-Essence tea and find it helps my immune system. Rarely (if ever), do I get colds or the flu. The tea also helps both of us sleep better at night.

 It's only 75% Juice...it has added sugar and sodium metabisulfite,1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:51 Mins </span>Hi, I was originally very excited to see a coconut drink about more inexpensive than some of the 100% Juice Brands, such as Zico, VitaCoco, Amy&Brian, One, or Naked. My wife loves Coconut Juice, and we had been buying Zico liter's from Trader Joe's for $3.75 each. This is the best deal available anywhere that I have found. Well, as someone who values my dollar, as soon as I saw the pricing on these I rushed to purchase it. There was no picture of the can with the nutrition facts or any mention of it being only 75% juice. Well, that's what you'll get if you purchase this. It is an inferior product in terms of juice quality compared with any of the 100% juice brands. They've added 13 grams of sugar (I used calculations based off how much sugar a 16.9 FL OZ can would have it was 100% juice), and they've also added something called Sodium Metabisulfite and of course they've watered it down with water. They cleverly call this Coconut Drink versus Coconut Juice because this is not Coconut Juice. All the Best, Geoff PS, The reason why I give this 1 star is because they don't disclose on the product page that it is 25% water, sugar, and sodium metabisulfite. …",13 out of 16 users found this review helpful
" great for travel, do not contain BPA",5,"First off, the bottles DO NOT contain BPA. The lids are coated in an epoxy that does, but there is another layer over that to help protect the BPA from getting to the formula. I actually called Similac's parent company to verify this. Yes they are expensive, but I get coupons all the time from Similac and use those to buy these bottles. They are wonderful for camping, fishing, or any other time sanitation may be an issue. All you have to do is attach your own nipple and ring. Much less to wash. Though they are really not made to do it, you can punch out the center from the ring and put in a standard nipple. It seems like it will leak, but it doesn't. Then you can just throw the whole thing away. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 The price of erythritol and oligofructose have nothing to do with it.,3,"Both of those sugars can be purchased cheap at any low carb online store (netrition has it for $7.50 for 1 lb!), and if I can purchase it that cheap, then you KNOW they're getting it dirt cheap. The price is high because low-carbers are desperate for sweets that won't add much to their daily carb intake; and Low carb specialties (the makers of these bars) know it. I've purchased these bars twice before and loved them; but I took the price personally. Yes, it's true, no one forced me to purchase them, but that's besides the point. You end up feeling like prey every time you see the price of your favorite items through the roof when you're desperate for something sweet. EVERY producer of low carb sweets pull that stunt; however, you'll find all your ""non-sweet"" products, such as condiments, etc., moderately priced. It's no coincidence. If you have the time, purchase ghirardelli unsweetened chocolate from Superstore, add a sucralose sweetener (Please see JJ's recommendation below)-preferably in liquid form, so there's no carbs-, add some cream, melt and you're done.

Quality kit contained everyting to make your first brew, but I've added a few things like hops bags and thermometer and extra bottle caps. I do not recommend buying inexpensive kits. I also recommend buying ""Joy of Home Brewing"" to go along with the kit. The kit directions are basic, the book has helpful tips. The price I paid was better than what I would pay locally, in this area, by about $40. I prefered new bottles, as I didn't want to mess with finding and cleaning bottles with non twist off caps. Extra 12 oz. bottles run about $12 for 24 bottles. First batch figures out to about $3 per bottle, which includes the cost of the kit. After that it's about 50 cents a bottle.

 UPDATED: RECIEVED RANCID OIL,5,"I recieved this oil last week and it is rancid. It smells and tastes like rotten tomatos or avacados and there is no way I could eat this on any type of salad. Both cans arrived in perfect condition and neither are near the expiration date on the bottle. I recommend purchasing from a local retailer so it can be taken back if its rancid. Its too much of a gamble buying from Superstore when you cannot return food items. Lesson learned. UPDATE 04/05/2011: After reading so many reviews about how good this product was I contacted La Tourangelle through their email system and told them about the situation and asked how this avocado oil was supposed to taste. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to taste the way it did or not. I didn't ask for replacements or anything because I know a lot of companies will not back their product if sold by Superstore. That is not the case with La Tourangelle. I was contacted by Diane through email about a week later asking for the batch numbers. I gave them and didn't hear anything back, until today. About an hour ago UPS delivered a box that contained two large cans of oil; one can of Avocado oil and one can of Hazelnut oil. I was so surprised because I didn't even remember giving them my address, but now recall it was required on their email submission form. At any rate La Tourangelle went above and beyond and they will be getting my business in the future, but only in a B&M store or through their website. That is the only place I can recommend anyone buy these products because Superstore will not take back food items. As far as the oil, the new Avocado oil tastes like real Avocados with no rancid taste or smell and the Hazelnut is out of this world. I plan to try them all out now, from the La Tourangelle website. Companies that go above and beyond will always get my business because they actually care about their product. Thank you La Tourangelle! …",91 out of 92 users found this review helpful
 Tim Burton Goes All Out in His Second Feature Film!,5,"Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT **** OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED …",10 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" Light, flavorful, healthy and satisfying",5,"I'm a bit granola obsessed, always on the search for a great tasting and healthy blend of ingredients. With reasonable effort to avoid hyperbole, Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters might be the best granola I have tried. The diverse grains are sweet and crispy, the nutrients are plentiful, and the price is right. I generally eat the granola dry, straight from the package, but I have eaten it with almond milk, making for a delicious, nutritious breakfast. For those who are curious, here is a breakdown of the nutritional content, as well as ingredients: Serving Size: 1/3 cup (29g) Servings Per Package: About 11 Calories: 120 Calories from Fat: 30 Total Fat: 3g (5%) Saturated: 0g Trans Fat: 0g Cholesterol: 0mg Sodium: 20mg (1%) Total Carb.: 22g (7%) Dietary Fiber: 5g (20%) Sugars: 5g Protein: 3g INGREDIENTS: Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), citrus fiber, citrus pectin. The blueberry flavor is, perhaps, a little too subtle, getting lost in the mix of the grains, but it does make its presence known. The variety of grains included is more robust than many other brand I have tried, especially the inclusion of quinoa. So there is a little something to please everyone. So, for those seeking a delicious, healthy granola blend, I highly recommend Kind Vanilla Blueberry Clusters. For my money, it may be the best grain blend on the market! …",36 out of 37 users found this review helpful
" Zero stars for flax seeds, 5 for salt, pepper, and cinnamon",5,"**UPDATE Mar 25, 2012: I found a spice grinder here on Superstore that does flax seeds: 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black . If you're looking for a good flax seed grinder, take a look at my review of the Krups grinder.** I purchased this grinder specifically to grind flax seeds two tablespoons at a time. It works... if you've got all day. I put two tablespoons of fresh flax seed into the grinder and twisted...and twisted....and twisted... After about a minute of grinding I had a litte bit of flax seed dust. So I tried grinding with various coarseness settings. Same result: very few of the seeds were ground. Desiring to be ""fair"", I filled the grinder with as much seed as it could hold, thinking the added weight of seeds would push the others into the grinding wheels to produce more ground product faster. Nope. This grinder still produced little product for the effort. Finally, I decided to stand there and grind away for as long as it takes to get my two tablespoons of ground flax seed. My wrists began to ache after 3 or 4 minutes and I still didn't have quite the two tablespoons full, but it was enough to get on with breakfast. Out of curiosity, I put some sea salt rocks in this grinder and wow! It grinds sea salt like a champ. Then I put some peppercorns in this grinder and wow again! It's great with peppercorns, too. I wish I'd known this before I bought the two expensive salt and pepper mills I already own. With my curiosity now out of control, I broke a couple of cinnamon sticks into shorter pieces and popped them into this grinder. it works well enough for those rare occasions that I need freshly ground cinnamon. Wanting to be thorough, I covered a couple of sticks of cinnamon with a paper towel and crushed them with two or three whacks of a hammer (a meat tenderizer would work, too) and put the pieces into this grinder. Phenomenal! It did a great job of grinding crushed cinnamon sticks. Summary: If flax seed is what you want to grind, don't buy this grinder unless you have plenty of time and strong wrists. If you're looking for something that looks great on the casual dining table and happens to do a great job of grinding salt rocks, peppercorns, and crushed cinnamon sticks at a great price, buy this grinder. I wanted to give zero stars to this grinder because it does a terrible job of grinding flax seeds. But because it does a great job grinding salt, pepper, and cinnamon AND is reasonbly priced, I give it 5 stars and plan to buy two more. …",25 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 Great peanut butter,5,"**UPDATE** I had this on a Subscribe & Save order from Superstore. I tried to put through the S&S order early, but Superstore has evidently decided not to carry it any longer, since they have ""suspended"" my upcoming order because my card on file expires in 6 weeks. To get around that, I cancelled my S&S and tried to re-activate it, but Superstore will not accept the order, saying that it was now only available from something called ""Lil-BigShots""(no there's a household word!!), an Superstore 3rd party seller. However, that seller charges what works out to THREE TIMES as much when their exorbitant shipping is added in. Since Superstore is courting the state of Texas as a possible new home, maybe this is just a sleazy ploy to make customers in Superstore's home state glad to see them go. I contacted Superstore support in an effort to fix this situation, but was given to someone who didn't speak English well at all and refused to help. I then called, and spoke to an obvious native English-speaker, who at least attempted to help. Right now, I'm more **** off at Superstore than I've ever been in 12 years doing business with them!! Item review I always liked Peter Pan PB, but for years it wasn't available in my area. Eventually, 12-oz jars came on the market in my area, but why waste all those plastic jars, so when Superstore started carrying these larger jars, I jumped on it. One thing I like about Peter Pan is that it seems to taste more of Spanish peanuts, which may be why it seems less sweet than Jif or Skippy, and just tastes of peanuts. If I want something sweeter, I have the Peter Pan Honey Roast Peanut Butter, which I'm able to occasionally find locally in 28-oz jars. And by the way, Pan Crunchy Peanut Butter, 40-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3) is great, too!! I just wish Superstore would sell these in packs of 4: then I could use the Super Saver option without having to find something to add to take the total up to $25.00. Doing a subscription takes the price down more, which is nice. One thing: since these are large jars, a longer knife is needed. I got a Knife - Spreader , which works fine, so I can get that last delicious bit of Peter Pan PB....or mayo, or whatever. The Mayo Knife will be fine until I can find a Spatula/Spreader for a decent price. A couple of words of warning: These three jars are shrink-wrapped together, and as a unit are heavy, so it's not a good idea to order a CD or DVD to fill out the $25 for Free Shipping. The first time that I ordered, I added a CD, and the case was destroyed. Next time, I ordered a DVD & requested that it be wrapped separately or in cardboard. Again, the case was broken, and Superstore's response was ""So what?"" Superstore ships this item via USPS, but it's a service like UPS or FedEx: no shipping to PO Boxes, so since I don't have mail delivery to my home, I have to put my street address, followed by my PO Box in parentheses. The PO needs a delivery confirmation(so they can't simply put it in a lock box), and when I've queried Superstore about this stupid policy, again their response is ""So what??"" Nice I've signed up for a subscription with Superstore on this. What a great deal!! …",12 out of 17 users found this review helpful
" Enjoyed by co-workers and kids, at the office and on Halloween",5,"We purchased this in addition to the Red Vines Black Licorice Twists. Red Vines provide excellent value; you will not find four pounds of candy at this price that is so popular with kids and adults. Red Vines are Star-K kosher-certified with no fat and only 140 calories per serving (five pieces/vines). The licorice is also versatile for many occasions. I use Red Vines licorice for Halloween, birthday parties and I keep a tub at the office to fend off co-workers who roam around in the afternoon, looking for a snack. Licorice requires tender, loving care. Unlike hard candy, which can (and often does) sit for months in the bottom of your grandmother's purse, licorice tastes best soft and fresh. Storage should be airtight and at room temperature. Lucky for us, this order arrives in a plastic tub with a nine-month shelf life. According to the Red Vines web site, ""many fans heat Red Vines candy in their microwaves for 5-7 seconds or until the candy reaches the desired softness.""

I am very disapointed in Superstore for this irresponsible price/shipping for this item and will not purchase this from them until they get their heads out of the clouds and offers this item for a competitive price and free shipping. If they would do this, I would do the subscribe and save option as I use this item every day. I would have given this item 5 stars if it wasn't for Superstore's price/shipping. …",40 out of 45 users found this review helpful
 Raw  Organic Cacao Powder,2,"I have purchased cacao from wilderness family in the past years, and gave them a great review. However, with my last purchase a few weeks ago, I was very disappointed. When I recieved my cacao, it WAS NOT from wilderness family naturals. It was from a company I had never heard of-Organic Herbal Essence. It did not have the certified organic logo on it. When I contacted the seller, they said they ""shared"" a listing with wilderness family naturals. I have been buying from Superstore for years, and have never heard of this practice before. If it was stated up front that this was the company selling the product that would be different. I just thought I should mention this so that any other potential buyers would know what to expect when ordering this. …",32 out of 35 users found this review helpful
 Amazing Stuff!,5,"We initially purchased Coconut Oil for dietary reasons. My wife and I had both read multiple books and articles that stated how healthy Coconut oil is and we are constantly looking for ways to improve our diets. We have since incorporated it into many aspects of our diets. In particular, its amazing with some of the juicing recipes we have come up with. I also enjoy cooking with it, but only with certain meals. Its important to note that cooking oils at high temperatures really cuts down on the nutritional content. So we always cook at lower temperatures when using Coconut or Olive oil. Anyways, we have come to love Coconut oil and it now has a permanent spot in our food pantry. We also started making homemade soap a few years back and while we didn't use coconut oil originally, we figured we would try it since we already had jars of it sitting on our shelves. Well, to make a long story short, its now incorporated in every single one of our recipes. In fact, my favorite soap is actually a recipe that focuses specifically on the coconut oil. Lastly, my wife one upped the soap making and started making homemade shampoo and conditioners and to say that they are amazing is a massive understatement. In particular, the conditioner she makes is unbelievable. I dont know the recipes but I do know that coconut oil is one of the major ingredients that she uses. My hair has never been softer and neither has hers. On top of that the smell is absolutely hypnotic. Bottom line - 12 months ago Coconut oil had absolutely no place in our home. Fast forward to today and....well, it now plays an major role in our lives, both for dietary and hygienic purposes. Even if you dont make homemade soaps, the health benefits alone should be more than enough for you to incorporate Coconut oil into your diet. Its one of the healthiest oils out there. Highly Recommended. …",58 out of 58 users found this review helpful
 Please avoid this species,1,"Chilean seabass (actually called Patagonian toothfish) is being fished to extinction. These fish take decades to reach maturity and live as long as 80 years, but they are being caught faster than they can reproduce. Try black sea bass, striped bass or rockfish instead.

" Acquired taste, but good!",5,"I grew up on Big Franks, so I admit they are an acquired taste. They don't taste like regular hot dogs. The texture is softer, and more chewy. But they are flavorful, and I think the flavor grows on you--although others in my family object entirely, and they find the aroma very disagreeable. But my youngest--and pickiest--child lives on them! They are her main source of protein. Fortunately they are basically healthful, and they are a great source of B vitamins. Plus, they are so convenient. You can eat them straight from the can. Start with the one in the middle so you can wiggle the others out that are stuck to the side of the can. ;) …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Used to be an awesome food but they changed the formula. NO GOOD!,1,"This used to be a great food, but they've changed the formula and my dogs have suffered. Their customer service is very rude. My dogs showed signs of distress within the first 24 hours of eating the new formula. Explosive Diaherra, Vomiting, Fur became dull. Change it back Canidae!!! …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Mouth watering!,5,"Over the last 3 years I have sampled every major protein bar offering and I have to say these Power Crunch bars are my favorite. It has a very sugary, chocolate taste that is similar to real chocolate wafer cookies. Power Crunch does not have the thick, hard protein ""paste"" you'll find in most bars. The chocolate wafer style is soft and almost disintegrates in your mouth - quite a contrast from most protein bar offerings. I've eaten probably a dozen a week for the last six weeks and I still cannot get enough of these bars. In all fairness most protein bars have 30+ grams of protein - more than double the amount than the 14 grams in Power Crunch. So personally I consider Power Crunch to be a very healthy high protein candy bar rather than protein bar. But after tasting Power Crunch, it'll be a long time before I reach for another Detour, MET-Rx, Oh Yeah, South Beach, or any other bar. …",29 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 A celiac parent's savior,5,"As a parent of a child who was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease, you might imagine the stress associated with informing your child he can no longer have one of his favorite meals - mac and cheese. That was until we discovered these canisters!!! These are our savior and the ability to buy them separate and in bulk is exactly what we needed. They arrived on time and in the expected condition. They are easy to use (they have a resealable top) so we get great mileage out of them. We will be buying them for years to come!! …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 MUST OWN!!!!,5,"Okay, maybe not a ""must own"" unless you are a die hard fan of the series but I am so I just had to have this!!! I first saw them at Hot Topic and was a little sad that they were $25 for only four bottles, but in all honesty these are pretty big bottles and very, idk how to describe it properly, ""Solid""?? Very durable product. I mostly wanted them just for fanboy sake, I didn't really care what it tasted like. But I did open one bottle, gave two away to my friends who are big fans. And I kept one unopened bottle for display. The flavor of the drink to me is a little odd, I am very surprised that they picked an Orange flavor instead of Strawberry or Cherry since the drink is supposed to be red like blood. All in all its decent, I couldn't drink it as if it was soda or anything but I will take an occasional sip from time to time. But like I said I mostly wanted these just to have since Im such a huge fan of the show so anyone else who is the same should definitely pick these up!!! …",9 out of 12 users found this review helpful
