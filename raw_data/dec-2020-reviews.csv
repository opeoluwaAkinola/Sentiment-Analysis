 Child Slavery,1,"Hershey's supply line comes from West Africa where there is a prevalence of child slavery in the cocoa bean industry. They continually refuse to make their supply line transparent or implement changes to guarantee the safety of children. Don't think this is relevant to a product review? Consider if it was your child, friend, relative who lived in slavery - would you want people buying products harvested by them? It is no surprise that people do not find this review helpful. Why would we ever want to know that our affluence and comfort is the result of abusing children? Please let us go on in ignorance!! …",3 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Not sure bottle was sealed,2,I srewed the top off the bottle without removing the hard plastic pull ring. Makes me wonder if it's safe to use. There is not other covering and I put the cap back on and it looks like it's never been opened! Since it's a powered supplement this doesnt look safe. I gave it a two because of the seal and the fact that I'll probably have to return it. …,2 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Unfortunately this contains...mono-diglycerides!,1,"I bought SIX of these based on the other Reviews....Unfortunately this contains...mono-diglycerides!...Even though it's unopened I'm not allowed to Return it! Boo! Hiss! )o= I'm out 26.00! (there was no mention of these in the description) Here's what my research found read my copy paste below... Mono-Diglycerides Just a New Name to Disquise An Old Silent Killer - Hydrogenated Oils First, let me make it clear, mono-diglycerides are nothing more than hydrogenated oils. There are those that will say I do not know what I am talking about concerning this new name the food industry is using for hydrogenated oils, but let me assure you, mono-diglycerides are hydrogenated before separated into mono-diglyceridies. The ""mono"" means they are a combination of various oils mixed together, hydrogenated, then certain fatty acids called diglycerides are then separated out. It is truly amazing how many people when confronted with the truth will still try to convince others the opposite of the truth. Mono-diglycerides remain the most widely used emulsifiers in food production. They are called mono-digylcerides because they are made from oils that have a high mono saturated fat content, but they are still hydrogenated. These are used in a wide variety of food manufacturing such as, breads, bagels, muffins, cookies, cakes, pies, donuts, pasta mixes, potato chips, ice creams, almost all packaged desserts, nearly all margarines and other spreads. Your local grocery bakery including Walmart bakeries use these oils. New margarine spreads Benecol(tm) and Take Control(tm) contain hydrogenated oils . Just read your label. Remember...its' your health! There are many food oil companies that produce mono-diglyerides. So when you read mono-diglycerides on packaged foods, it is nothing more than hydrogented oils. Below is a sample of one product listings from Gillco, oils manufactured by Quest International, one of the largest food oil producing companies worldwide. Gillco's url address is [...]. They sell mono-diglycerides using these names, Myverol®, Myvacet®, Myvatex®, Myvaplex® and they stipulate on the company's fact sheet that they are ""hydrogenated"". *****I'm not going to eat this...but I'm not condemning anyone else that does...Skippy Natural Peanut Butter is safer in my opinion.

 NOT edible,1,"This product tastes like soap. When I called the company to see why, they said it's not food grade. Literally tastes like soap, so it must have been lingering and co-mingling with soap products. The raw tag is misleading - I thought this was edible cocoa butter that you make raw food desserts from. Now I have a pound of chocolate smelling, soap tasting, rock hard chunks to fool with. Very disappointed. …",17 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 Based on beef being grass fed however . . .,5,"the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately I'm unable to review the flavor as I forgot I can't have beef anymore (due to health issues). Ingredients: beef, flavoring supplement (salt, dextrose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, spices, spice extractives, soybean oil), vinegar, brown sugar, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices Here is some info found on the internet: Maltodextrin ~ maltodextrin from corn or soy can be very unsafe/poison for anyone. As all GMO products like corn and soy are genetically engineered from the monsanto company. they insert a bacteria in all GMO products, and this changes the natural organic developing of corn or soy. do not buy anything that contains maltodextrin or titanium for your own health. Maltodextrin made in the US is made from corn. Corn in the US is a GMO food so Maltodextrin as derived from a Gmo is extremely unsafe. Soy ~ this particular info from: (...) . . .fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits. Fermented soy does not wreak havoc on your body like unfermented soy products do. Here is just a sampling of the health effects that have been linked to unfermented soy consumption: *Breast cancer *Brain damage *Infant abnormalities *Thyroid disorders *Kidney stones *Immune system impairment *Severe, potentially fatal food allergies *Impaired fertility *Danger during pregnancy and nursing and for all ~ Jesus Christ (Yahushua HaMashiach) is coming back. Don't leave this world without Him... Gift of God With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news. It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world. Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God. The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God. The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction. Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc. The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever? Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God. God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven? My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight! It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him! Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death. Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ! Yahushua loves you! …",3 out of 38 users found this review helpful

" These are good.  Very, very good.",5,"I don't mean ""good for a gluten free cookie"", or ""almost like a normal cookie"". No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good. No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells. No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture. They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free. No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also. According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well. That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff. You're probably wondering what the catch is, right? It definitely isn't the taste. As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good. I only see two drawbacks. 1) Cost. Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected. 2) Quantity. The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies. 16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them. However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us. I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag. Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating. Even so, I still wish there were more in a package. One last note, just because I found it to be unusual. Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight. These aren't. Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others. There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space. It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Low calorie/low fat because it's unbearable to eat,1,"Better'n Peanut Butter is one of the foulest things I have ever eaten. It has a runny, sticky consistency that tries to replicate the real thing, but more effectively replicates a dirty diaper. If you ignore its slightly (oddly) medicinal smell and actually consume this product, you'll wish you hadn't. The taste? Think less peanut butter, more roasted peanut-flavored glue. Low calorie/low fat? Absolutely; especially since I couldn't stand to choke down more than a few bites. In the end, I opted to go without lunch rather than eat my Better'n Peanut Butter sandwich. As a vegetarian who commonly shops at natural food stores/in natural food sections and who is always looking for low calorie foods, I can generally handle ""alternative"" flavors. I drink rice milk. I eat imitation chicken (soy based). I use whole wheat items whenever possible. So while I was not at all expecting Better'n Peanut Butter to fully live up to it's name, I at least thought it may come close to matching the taste of the real thing (I've eaten the low fat versions of Jif and Skippy peanut butter for years and actually prefer them over their full-fat predecessors). I couldn't have been more wrong. …",23 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Great Stuff,5,"As for the quality of this food if you're unfamiliar with holistic foods, this stuff is top quality. It has many forms of meat, no grains whatsoever, and no controversial ingredients, etc... You know the drill, a top quality food that is unavailable in grocery stores. Actually one of the best on the market amongst hundreds of different kinds. This stuff is pricey but your dog will eat less so it sort of offsets the price a bit. With regular food your dog is eating corn, potato peelings, rotten rice, and animal guts and blood swept off the floor of the slaughter house. That food is so low in nutrients your dog must eat tons of it and poop out all the poison that shouldn't be in the food. With a great food like Orijen your dog will eat less, absorb most of it, and have fewer and more solid stools. There are a few people who are a little weary of Canidae. Canidae now makes a grain free formula which is excellent. It's almost as good as Orijen and cheaper as well. If you want one of the better foods on the market and a good price, Canidae grain free is your ticket. But if you absolutely want the Lamborghini of dog foods then Orijen is your buy, although Canidae is a Porsche and still pretty darn good. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.,5,"UPDATE: The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great. Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution: I have been buying the ""Organic Liver for Dogs"" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Superstore. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product. I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Superstore are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets. As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem. Unfortunately, Superstore doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally). UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me. I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars. I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well. I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars. Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

" As Homer would say, ""Mmmmm, Chorizo""",5,"When I was an exchange student living in Spain almost 10 years ago, I fell in love with the food there, most especially the chorizo. When I got back to the US, all I could find was mexican chorizo which is *not* the same as and is *completely* different than spanish chorizo. I eventually found some US-made spanish-style chorizos but none of them was quite like what I had in Spain. This is the real deal. This is exacly what I remember from Spain. And the funny thing is, that much of the chorizo I had in Spain was homemade chorizo in central/southern Spain (Ciudad Real to be exact) but this brand comes from northern Spain. This is definitely the best chorizo I've had in the US and is perfect for making any spanish dish that calls for chorizo, including lentejas (lentil stew), paella, and migas (fried bread crumbs with various meats served on the side). It is also outstanding to eat as is--I know I could eat a whole chorizo in one sitting if it wasn't so expensive but that's the price of imported gourmet foods. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Overrated,2,"The rave reviews for Carbon's Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour are a mystery to me. This pancake mix is mediocre. Nearly all of the rave reviews have come from people who use the mix to make waffles. The few who have made pancakes have found the mix to be very disappointing. Although this mix is called ""malted,"" it lacks malt (or any other) flavor. The pancake texture isn't particularly good either. If you live in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, or Kentucky, go to your local Meijer grocery store and buy their brand of malted pancake mix. The malt taste and fluffy texture are far superior to Carbon's, and the mix costs less than half as much. If you don't live in one of those states and are primarily interested in making pancakes, use Superstore to order Mix Pancake Sweet Potato, 24-Ounce (12 Pack) or Cottage Classics Oats n' Apple Pancake Mix, 12-Ounces (Pack of 6) , both of which are unique and much better for pancakes than Carbon's. I haven't used Carbon's mix to make waffles, but I'm guessing that the rave reviews are due to the texture, since flavor is lacking. Carbon's mix is a very fine powder, similar to cake flour, and apparently this results in a better waffle (though not necessarily a better pancake). Since Meijer's mix is also a very fine powder, it would probably also make great waffles in addition to delicious malt-flavored pancakes. Don't let the hype fool you into thinking that Carbon's mix is something special. It's good but not great. …",6 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" Alive, Ageless, Gourmet and Gathering Years... meaning the oil!]",5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 9:15 Mins </span>Some say the COCONUT palm is the Tree of Life. They say Life is honored and perpetuated through its meat, its water, its oil, its presence. In my opinion, EVAGold, and the Nutiva brand of coconut oil shown in the video, are among the highest qualities available, of life healing offerings from this sacred gift of a tree. I had sensed this cold pressed oil's uncanny value as soon as I saw a picture of a jar of EVAGold on Swanson's product list on Superstore. I had come to trust Swanson [as much as I continue to trust Superstore] from purchases of several types of magnesium supplements including Oil 8 fl oz Spray . Reading Bruce Fife's COCONUT OIL MIRACLE , provided necessary information for working with this fruit. Reading that book also clarified my previous belief in the healing nutrition in coconut oil, and in these brands' production purity [other excellent brands are also available; these two are just the ones I've used successfully so far]. My experience of using this type of cold pressed, virgin coconut oil for only 24 hours had shown results which made me feel blessed! I've been slowly and steadily rectifying a serious magnesium deficiency while searching for what felt like a missing catalyst or synergistic essence which would cause magnesium supplementation to be accepted by the body, and then seated into the cellular level of life enhancing operations. Dr. Carolyn Dean's book, MAGNESIUM MIRACLE is an excellent guide to Magnesium's magic in healing, normalizing, and strengthening the embodied human soul. I've been thinking that coconut, in its several forms of use, could work as a catalyst for magnesium, while magnesium works as a catalyst for all other nutrients, including coconut oil, to function correctly. What a team!! To understand the vital message in what I'm trying to say here, please be cajoled or even coerced (jokingly) into reading some of my Superstore reviews on magnesium products and the two books linked above... as a start on a journey to understanding, appreciating, and relishing LIFE. Other great Magnesium and Coconut books and products are available, easily found using search capacities. According to some experts, the most important thing to know about oils, fats, and coconut products is that they should be gently, minimally, and carefully processed by cold pressing, preferably labeled ANH (absolutely no heat used in processing); the reasons for this are detailed in Fife's book. Also according to some experts, the most important thing to know about magnesium is that it needs to be held in highest priority and percentage in the minerals taken into the body, and that certain foods, additives, and supplements can defeat bio-availability of magnesium. Especially calcium needs to be taken in much lower amounts than magnesium, and in the current food marketplace and general eating habits; calcium is usually assimilated in large quantities, causing illnesses related to calcification or deposits, and contributing to magnesium deficiency. This situation is detailed in Dr. Dean's book. My main concern with coconut usage for persons like me who are severely deficient in magnesium is that most offerings of coconut I'm aware of hold more potassium than magnesium, which could upset the balance and primary necessity of magnesium. In my non-professional opinion magnesium is the INDEX nutritional substance; the A-Priori for Life. Maybe even the Tree of Life needs magnesium as its priority nutrient... With adequate magnesium held within the cell structures... [some experts say cells need to retain 10,000 times more magnesium than any other mineral]... the body can adequately and correctly utilize other minerals and necessary nutrients, in order to live strong and disease free. [See my review of Dr. Dean's book.] Maybe magnesium seats life, coconut is the cozy catalyst, and taste buds rule!

 Good matcha for beginners and health conscious,3,"If it was my first matcha i would had given it 5 starts but I feel i have to disagree with the majority of reviewers. Its certainly a good quality matcha but i found it lacks aroma and taste compared to other matchas i tried(yuuki-cha, o-cha and ippodo). The taste is very light, almost flat and you have to watch the water temperature as when going over 190 it gets very bitter(never had this problem before). By the way I always preheat my chawan, dry it, sift the matcha, check the water temperature and then whisk it. As for packaging thats the first matcha i tried that comes in a inner bag. Personally i find it annoying and messy not to mention that you will have to expose the whole amount of matcha to oxygen in order to make it easier to scoop. i prefer the cans i got before that comes with sealed top and a oxygen absorber inside. I noticed the loss of flavor from Domatcha much faster than usual. Would i buy it again? maybe. Cant beat the Superstore fast ordering convenience. sometimes my japanese orders take too long to arrive and i found myself out of my daily green nectar. otherwise i think the extra money im paying for a higher quality is more than worth since my primary reason to drink matcha is flavor. One more thing: dont bother trying to make koicha(thick ceremony style tea) with domatcha. its not the proper grade for it and you will get a very grainy/powdery/bitter drink. Otherwise it makes a good usucha and its certainly a great value for the price. …",53 out of 56 users found this review helpful

I test it by touching the wires, to make sure it's on; the shock is not serious, but not something you'd voluntarily repeat, so it's not going to harm animals, pets, neighbors or yourself. There are two modes: grounded and two-wire. For fence work, the two-wire seems best; the intruders have to touch both wires, so it doesn't bother birds (who only land on one wire). For ground use, you want to ground one wire into the ground, and string the other wire as the ""fence"". The intruder only has to touch one wire and be standing on the ground. I had it in two-wire mode, with one wire accidentally touching a branch of a tree; the current went up the branch (!) and created a shock several feet up the branch. It's branded Havahart, which is a good name; it does what it's supposed to. Get the aluminum wire, it's easy to cut and splice, and you need some plastic standoffs; if you get the yellow stubby ones, you will have a problem mounting them since they require a post sticking up. I nailed them directly into a wooden fence or the eave of the house, it's a lot easier than trying to affix them to a large nail stuck into the wood. For ground use, 10"" wire sticks are great; the stubby standoffs do actually affix to the 1/8 wire, and you can adjust the height. Raccoons are members of the cat family, and their stool CAN (does not always) contain brain-worm larvae or eggs. The life-cycle of these worms starts in the intestines of cats who ingest an infected mouse; for two weeks, they excrete virulent eggs of the brain worms. The eggs are capable of surviving in salt water or your backyard for up to a year; if someone accidently touches the stool and then food, they get infested. Moreover, wind-blown dust can contain the eggs. When a human or a mouse gets infested, the brain-worm eggs hatch; the small worms go right through intestine walls, and settle in nearby cells, exploding them and multiplying to other cells, causing a mild but discernable reaction. The body immune system usually wins, and drives them into encapsulated form, in the brain tissue, but has to continually keep attacking them to stop them from spreading again and destroying the body, cell by cell. Alarmingly, 22% of the people in the US are infested with brain worms; there is no cure, the worms exist in the brain until death, just waiting for the immune system to weaken and let them continue destroying the body. The eggs pass right through sewage systems, which is probably how so meny people get infected, because cities like San Diego have a waiver from normal treatment requirements and dump primary sewage into the Ocean. The eggs remain a danger for months. This is also why the Sea Otters are dying in Monterey Bay, because they eat shellfish which are infected by nearby sewage operations where people dump cat litter down the toilet, or else when raccoon droppings get washed into the Ocean. So getting rid of cat and raccoon droppings is a matter of survival, and this is one way to discourage them. Raccoons like to create ""latrines"" in one area, and the whole Raccoon gang uses it. Don't let it be your yard, especially if you have kids. …",28 out of 29 users found this review helpful

There's even ""giant"" pocky, ""custard"" pocky, ""green tea"" etc... Always more new ones coming out. But, if there are no market or if other internet stores are comparable in price, than maybe a wise choice for the curious snacker. Beware though, even I didn't like the sesame. And FYI, Men's pocky is just ""bitter"" instead of ""milk"" chocolate.

 Sodium content extremely high!,1,"I bought these beans and the same size can of organic black beans from Westbrae Naturals for about the same price. Libby's says it serves 3.5 servings of 1/2 cup each while Westbrae serves 3 (1/2 cup each). This is significant because it allows Libby's to s-t-r-e-t-c-h the truth a bit in sodium levels. Westbrae's Sodium 140mg (6% per serving). Libby's Sodium level get this! 440mg (18% per serving). I have found these unnecessary high sodium levels on all of Libby's canned products including their canned organic green beans which I will not feed to my toddler anymore. Unfortunately when something sits in this salty solution it soaks up the sodium- therefore you can't just rinse it off. Libby's could make this healthier, gain more customers, AND save some money on the manufacturing of this product if they reduced the sodium. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 This Does the Whole Thing,5,"I use this -- for the most part -- instead of bread. I am Bi-Coastal and I keep these in the freezer both home in NYC and out West. I will have one or two a day and that is it for bread products. Two is 120 calories. You can use them to wrap anything you like. If you want some tensile strength just leave one on the counter for a while before using. This has cache. Who wouldn't want a crepe as a sort of ultimate gourmet taco? Not knockin' tacos or bread, but if you are a minimalist like me you want few things that are great. These take up no room. You can order them in bulk. Among my uses -- to wrap concoctions I create and make a meal. YYou do not neeed much of a concocktion. Max two tablespoonfuls. To put melted cheeze on and wrap up and make a meal. To put a spoonful of icecream on and wrap up and make a treat. To put a bit of preserves on and roll up for my equivalent of a treat. And you know what? When you do not need any, they are still there, taking up little room and available whenever you get the urge. Bread substitute? Well, everyone needs bread. I still go out for breakfast in NYC and will have a Bialy. But before I used to do three bialy's worth of bread a day. I have cut that by more than half.

 Nature's Variety has changed their formula,2,"I looked for a long while to find a dry kibble that my cats would enjoy and tolerate. One cannot have rice or other grains. They preferred the previous formula of Nature's Variety Instinct Rabbit meal formula. I purchased a new bag and the cats wouldn't touch it and in fact were repelled by it. I looked at the ingredients and the order, and they were the same until you got to the ingrediant ""Natural Chicken flavor"" on the old bag. On the new bag, it said ""Natural pork flavor."" The individual kibble are flatter and airy and the old kibble was denser and a bit rounder. Further the old formula says ""90%+ of the protein is from rabbit,salmon,chicken, herring meals."" The new formula says ""75% pure animal ingredients and nutriousl oils."" In any case, there are some differences. I'm not sure if it is the pork flavor, the disc texture and density or even if there is a change in the ratio.

 Very good if you love blueberries,4,"I have really been into Yogi tea and trying them all! I have all the green teas and after a month of testing them I conclude that Rejuvenation tastes the best. It has a natural peach and lemon flavor that is very natural and mild. Most say the Simply Green tastes the best but to me it was far too boring. I got used to all the special herbs and natural flavors and the Simply Green had none added. I do not like the artificial flavors at all, nor do I like the artificial sweet taste added by too much stevia leaf. This Slim Life tea is very good- Amazingly good compared to diet green tea pills! I do not ever feel the side effects of a diet pill with this tea and I drink a lot of it being I got 6 boxes from Superstore. I think it's a wonderful tea but I'd prefer it if the natural blueberry flavor was left out. It does taste natural and sweet but mixed with Green tea, I'd prefer the lemon or peach flavors myself. If you do love the flavor of berry in your tea, you will love this one and it is mild and pleasant to drink all day long. The Super Anti-Oxidant variety of tea tastes good except for the licorice. The licorice is okay in the bedtime and calming teas, but does not taste right in green tea. Other then the licorice it does have a very good lemon flavor that is soothing and mild. The Kombucha tea is also great which has a berry taste, that is good and natural passion fruit and plum, but I prefer the lemon flavor in my green tea. The Slim Life tea is also very good but it does have a blueberry flavor in it, but it is worlds better then the Fasting tea, which tastes the worst of all the Yogi teas. I just love the Yogi tea positive messages don't you? At first I just bought these teas for the messages then I learned to love the tea as well! Rejuvenation is my favorite green tea and Peach Detox and Redbush Chai are my favorite flavored teas and make exceptionally good iced tea as well! The flavors, however, are very close and it took me quite a while to figure out which green tea I preferred the best. This one is good if you like licorice in your green tea that is.

 this'll always hit the spot--even with that packaging...,4,"Healthy Choice makes an excellent soup and this chicken with rice soup in a microwavable bowl is no exception. The soup is delicious and overall fairly healthy for you. I like that the soup provides a good deal of chicken, vegetables and even the rice tastes fresh! The broth is also very tasty. Healthy Choice makes a high quality chicken noodle soup than most other brands because they include chicken and rice while keeping limits on fats, sugars and cholesterol. One look at the ingredients shows us more positives: There are no trans fats and the soup has almost zero saturated fat. It is also extremely low in cholesterol. However, it does contain sodium (480 mg per serving) so if you need to watch your sodium intake please consider this before buying this product. Unfortunately, sometimes the top lid is difficult to remove and then you have to handle the bowl very carefully to avoid spilling the soup. The soup is filled up almost to the brim of the bowl; and so it's easy to spill a little! The top lid is somewhat cumbersome and doesn't really help enough when it's on top of the bowl inside the microwave oven, either. The cover didn't completely cover the soup bowl in the microwave and some soup spilled inside the microwave. And yes, you DO need a solid surface on which you can open this container otherwise you are almost certain to have a spill because the soup bowl is filled completely. Overall, the soup itself is excellent. The packaging, on the other hand, is nothing special. The cover lid is cumbersome to remove and inside the microwave soup can spill out through the cover. I think that the packaging drives the cost of this soup higher than it otherwise might be. The packaging needs to be changed; perhaps Healthy Choice could make a slightly higher bowl so that the soup won't easily spill out when you remove the plastic lid. I highly recommend this for people who love chicken soup with vegetables and rice if they don't need to worry about sodium in their diets. If you are bothered by the packaging, however, then try another brand. Five stars for the actual soup combined with three stars for the packaging makes this a four star review. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful

" Oh, yeah.",5,"I just got this stuff in the mail for my birthday. I know, an odd Bday gift, but I love this kind of fare.

I normally carry cayenne pepper in my purse as a personal condiment and I use a stockpile of habanaroes every week. Everything I eat is not just spicy, but tongue numbing hot. I will say. I bought two cups of chili and added ONE TEASPOON of Dave's 2009. I thought that would be a good place to start. Wow. Not so bad at first. Spicy, but pleasant. Then it hits the back of your throat and you have to cough. Then your nose is running. Then you are sweating. Then your ears and hair start to burn. It sounds nightmarish, I know. But, I love it and this was totally worth it. This stuff goes a long, long way. In no way should you use this stuff as a dip or drizzle it on top of anything, like your pizza.

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",18 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 Excellent but not outstanding chocolates,4,"See's Candies is a well-known San Francisco chocolate company, now with stores throughout the United States. In California, the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door. I've had See's Candies many times, most recently this assortment, and while See's makes an excellent product, the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor. Still, these confections are above average; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.<p>Anyone receiving a box of See's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made.

 Health Concern! Reservoir Coating Flakes Off.,1,"I loved this product for about 4.5 months! I used it to make batches of organic baby food several times each month and loved how easy it was to make healthy food for my daughter. Occasionally I would notice dark particles in the lighter colored foods that I would make and just thought I was seeing bits of the skin from potatoes or carrots that I didn't peel with the greatest of care. Two weeks ago, I noted a larger speck in the potatoes I was feeding my daughter and pulled it out. It looked like a metallic flake. I began to examine the machine and discovered that the interior coating of the water reservoir had begun to bubble up and was flaking off along the bottom of the tank! I contacted the company asking for the chemical composition of the coating so that I may have my daughter tested, as I had no idea how much of this coating she had ingested over how long a period. The company representative first said that there was no coating and that the tank was ceramic, so what I noted MUST be limescale build-up. I am not unfamiliar with limescale, and absolutely know that THIS is not mineral deposits, but the actual darkish grey, metallic coating (underneath where the grey has flaked off, the reservoir is black). I took pictures to send the company and spoke with other company representatives who finally admitted that yes, there WAS a coating and said they thought it was silicon-based over aluminum. I asked again for the name of the compound and/ or the chemical make-up so that I could have my daughter appropriately examined. They agreed to contact the company in China and get that information. They called back days later and said that the Chinese company sent a letter saying that the ""silver coating"" was tested and FDA approved. That's it. I asked AGAIN for the chemical composition, and was told that it would take an additional 3 days to get it. In three days, they called me back and said that the coating was a silicone material approved for food contact. In other words, they reiterated EXACTLY THE SAME THING that they told me previously. This company is STILL refusing to disclose what the interior reservoir is coated with and it has been two weeks since my initial request with them. The company claims that they have never received a complaint like this, so if anyone else out there has had this issue, I suggest that you contact Baby Brezza (1-888-396-6552) and let them know so that they can possibly recall this unsafe product. The lot number on the bottom of my machine is WSI-030.

 Very Impressed,5,"After a lot of research, i decided to switch my 3-yr old Doberman from Iams to Canidae and have been very impressed with the product. Samson LOVES this stuff too, with the Iams I had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food/tablefood, but with the Canidae, he eagerly wolfs it down by itself. And why not? The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less ""filler"", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a ""super-premium"" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan.

The plastic bottles don't have as long of a shelf life (2 years compared to 3 years for the glass bottles). The plastic that they are made with (PET) has not been proven to be safe.

 I cannot say enough good things about this stuff,5,"I first heard about steel cut oats on the Oprah show about its health benefits. First of all I DO NOT like regular oatmeal like you buy in the grocery store. I don't like the slimy texture. But I figured I'd try steel cut oats and I'm glad I did. They are delicous and very good for you! The warm nutty aroma when they are cooking is very appetizing. I add a little bit of sugar or splenda and some cinnimon, it tastes fantastic! I also sometimes skip the cinnimon and add a tablespoon of granola and/or some dried berries. Excellent healthy breakfast. Normally these take about 30 minutes to cook on the stovetop. I found a way to cut the cooking time in half. Take 1/3 cup of oats, and 1 1/3 cup of water and put it in a large microwavable bowl. Cook in the microwave on High for 5 minutes, stir, then another 5 minutes, then stir again, and then cook about another 2-3 minutes until the texture is just the way you like it. For those of you who are asking what the difference is between regular oatmeal and steel cut oatmeal: -Steel-Cut Oats are whole grain groats (the inner portion of the oat kernel) which have been cut into two or three pieces using steel discs. Golden in color and resembling mini rice particles, they are as nature intended - nothing added and nothing taken out. -Rolled oats are flake oats that have been steamed, rolled, re-steamed and toasted.

 Content means less than names,2,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed. Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food. Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm? …",6 out of 49 users found this review helpful

 Finally-help for my cat's skin allergy!!!,5,"I have been struggling for years to find a cat food that would relieve a stubborn skin allergy on one of my cats. Finally after reading on a website (I'm sorry I don't remember which one), someone mentioned this food and I found it at my local Farm and Home Store (like a Southern States feed store). I was really skeptical that this would work, but I was hopeful because the front of the bag said no wheat, corn or soy, plus it contains Omega 3 fatty acids. Imagine my surprise when after one bag of this food, my cat's long-time allergy where he licked all the hair off his belly and caused little sores all over began to clear up. For the first time since he was a kitten he has hair on his belly that is not the result of me breaking down and taking him to the vet for a cortisone shot - something I tried not to do often because it is not good for cats and can cause diabetes. In addition to my main concern for getting my poor kitty feeling better, I was paying so much money for Prescription ZD diet from the vet's office and with five cats I had to isolate one cat to feed him while the others got the less expensive store brand. Anyway - I'm just saying - after trying EVERYTHING I could think of - homepathic remedies, $$$ trips to vet, $$$ trips to cat dermatologist, and many $65 bags of ZD diet, this wonderful food has stopped the allergy and its lower cost means I can allow all five of my cats to eat it. I know all allergies are different, but this belly licking behavior seems to be very common if the websites and comments I saw while research the problem are any indication. Try this food - give it at least a full month before deciding if it works. I am so thankful to have found this food. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Disappointed with my first farmhouse pancake,1,"I used to buy Bob's Red Mill Organic 7 Grain Pancake & Waffle, Whole Grain Mix until I saw all these rave reviews about StoneWall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle mix. I decided to order from Superstore and tried it this morning. This pancake mix is very fine and powdery. When I made my pancake mix, the mix was all over my kitchen floor. The mix is almost foamy like when it is done mixing. The waffle recipe from the label asks for 2 Tbsp. of melted butter, which I never use that much when I use the Rob's Red Mill pancake mix. I could only make two perfect 7"" round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be 3-4 pancakes. The pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review. However, I also tasted a lot of chemicals in it. I guess one reason it is so fluffy is a lot of baking soda in the ingredient. Looking at the ingredient label did I realize it has more chemicals than other brands. And I do not understand what ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR it has to be added in when this pancake mix is just the normal type with no fancy flavors like Cinnamon and Apple, etc. In short, I am going back to my Rob's Red Mill brand, at least I know what I am digesting in my stomach. …",18 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Great Product,5,"Firstly, the product itself - good taste, excellent sweetener, easy to use. It is sort of expensive, so I only buy it on sale. I prefer honey for most sweetening applications, but the agave nectar is actually easier to use, as it is somewhat less viscous and dissolves more easily. On another note, I have never had trouble with the packaging, which is often a problem with gooey liquid items from Superstore. There are seals under the bottle tops, plus shrink wrap over the tops, and the bottles also come shrinkwrapped together. As always, be careful in ordering liquid products through the mail. A rotting box of leaking goo is the bane of the delivery worker and an unwelcome addition to your doorstep. Thirdly, this product comes in other sizes/packaging. I recommend exploring all options to get the best price, and consider Subscribe and Save as well.

 Saeco Vienna Plus Expresso Machine,4,Easy to use machine that works well making espresso or just an single cup of coffee. The only complaint I have is if you are using a large cup for regular coffee you have to angle putting in and removing the cup since the bottom of the drip spouts are not high enough even when adjusting the pull-down or push-up spout that is provided. This is a well priced unit for what it provides you. You can adjust the grind of the beans but it comes manufacturer set for a medium grind. It comes with lights that once turn solid green let you know that you are ready to use whatever function you choose and dial for adjusting espresso to a full cup of coffee is clearly marked and easy to read. Steam is provided when pressing the 3rd button on - when it is off you get very hot water dispensed. The area for grinding the beans handles a lot so if you like switching types of coffee then you have to keep only the amount for what you are using in the grinder since there is no way of easily switching coffee beans once the container is full. Overall I would recommend it for anyone who likes to prepare their own coffee because of it's price and ease of use. …,13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Not recommended after they changed their formula,5,"I started feeding my dogs Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food almost 5 years ago. Prior to that I used NutroMax. Wow, what an amazing food. My german shepherd and 2 golden retrievers have the most incredible coats. Their poops are firm (and easy to pick up) and nearly odorless. No allergies either, unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems. I've convinced one person to change to Canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it. I buy it locally as I go thru 40 pounds every 3 weeks (feeding 3 large dogs). I highly recommend this food, could not be happier. Update: Canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late 2008 and at the same time, in order to save money, changed their formulas. Added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and GI problems. The organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about Canidae than any manufacturer in recent history, due to their formula change. A fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about 50% of the Canidae bags back from owners w/ pets having problems w/ the new formula. All 3 of my dogs had bad reactions, and I even did a gradual change over because I was told ahead of time (by my friend) that they changed the formula. Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, scratching. My one golden scratched himself raw to the point I had to take him to the vet. After using Canidae for many years, and recommending it to many others, I decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it. I switched to using California Natural Lamb and Rice and Orijen Adult, two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available. Both company control the ingredients, manufacture the food, have numerous quality checkpoints, and do their own distribution. My dogs are different ages and have different needs so I do a blend of the CalNat and Orijen and WOW, what a difference. Their coats are shiny, their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free. And they love it! Both are great foods, a bit more expensive than other foods but to me, worth every penny. Cal Nat and Orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion. If you are considering Canidae, I'd recommend you look at Cal Nat or Orijen instead. New Rating: Canidae - 0 stars California Natural - 5 stars Orijen - 5 stars (I'd give Orijen 10 stars if I could, it really is that good). …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

It could not be eaten out of the can because of the dreadful flavor. There is no cream in this soup and any bisque is heavy with cream. There's milk, wheat flour, and teeny dots of lobster. I'm a good cook but I doubt that I can doctor this up to taste like anything worth eating. When I read the other negative reviews, I thought...oh well. Folks from other parts of the country don't know what real lobster bisque tastes like, but surely Bar Harbor is doing it right. WRONG. As a New Englander, I know what good lobster bisque tastes like and it's not this. Unless you enjoy mystery food and dislike lobster, I'd advise against purchasing this. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 No need medicine anymore for my stomachache just use the Manuka Honey,5,"I had the stomachache many times in my life and notice when I get older it last longer, I am 34 yrs. Recently I had the stomachache again I took Nexium 40 mg 2 times a day then switch to 1 time a day and 1 Miracid which is also same benefit like Nexium but I just don't want to take high dose of Nexium. I took medicine for about 2 months but I still have the pain which most of time is at night. One day while I was searching about natural acne cure and someone recommended using honey and they said manuka honey is even better. I've never heard about this manuka honey before and started to do some research over the internet and found many interesting information especially helping about stomachache. So I decided to try, first time I bought it at Whole Foods Markets and chose this Wedderspoon brand after doing some researched. It took me about 5 days then I saw some improvement I didn't have much pain at night time. Then I started to stop the medicine and taking only manukar honey the tip is, I took 1 teasppon x 4 times a day because in that time I still have lots of pain and with some small piece of bread about size of 1 inch, so it can hold better in my stomach and did like the suggestion no drink or food after take honey about 15 min. By keep doing this about 3rd week, my problem is completely cured. Nowadays, I do the maintenance by taking 1 teaspoon a day or anytime if I eat some spicy food then I feel some symptom come up I took it right away and that's it, no more medicine for me. However, for some other people you may have it as the 2nd help together with medicine which that was I did in 1st week and after it cure then I am ok with just this honey alone. And I found that buy it from Superstore the price is much better, I hope they have some special offer if buy more quantity then get better price because I want to pack a lot of them when I go back to my country. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Quite possibly the worst product I have ever purchased in my life,1,"I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday. I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early. First of all, these are grossly overpriced. At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6. You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example). Even with the ""discounts"" that are offered through Superstore or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced. Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time: By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake. So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting. The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste. The awful taste. It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink. So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you. Otherwise, steer clear. The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever. I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day. Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy. I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now. I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review. I think it may have even given me a stomachache. So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go: Cons ---- Awful taste that doesn't go away Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have Doesn't actually give you energy Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption Jitters Inability to concentrate Might make you irritable May cause stomachaches Pros ---- If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter. Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product. It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life. And I've bought a lot of junk. Don't buy into the false advertising. Stay away. This stuff should be banned. …",16 out of 31 users found this review helpful

 Best K-cups I have tried for the non-coffee drinker!,5,"Enjoying a cup of coffee is not a great option for me because I only enjoy it with a lot of high calorie creamer. I have been buying the Gloria and Green Mountain hot chocolates because they are only 1 WW (Weight Watcher) points. However, they always tasted watery and were just something I drank out of necessity to fill the void of snacking. Fast forward 50 pounds lighter and I purchased the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte and Dark Hot Chocolate at Bed Bath and Beyond (because it was all they carried and Superstore quit carrying the other brands) and I have never been so surprised! What a fantastic flavor! The Latte is 2 WW points and the Dark hot chocolate is 1 WW point. I can even use the highest water option and I still get a rich full taste. If you are looking for an alternative to coffee, this will not disappoint!

 New Formula. Double the Carbs!!,3,"This WAS a great product. It was great tasting and it had a crazy low amount of carbs compared to most anything else out there. For people who need to manage their carb intake, this was a real treat and there wasn't much else out there that compared. There is, I found on receiving my latest shipment, a new formula and the carb count has almost doubled from 8g per serving to 15g. This might not matter to most people but for some it can be a critical issue. I imagine it still tastes great with all the extra sugar and milk or whatever they've added but, unfortunately, this product no longer serves the niche it once did. Where it once was this great-tasting, low-carb indulgence, it's now just one of ten million sugary things out there. …",26 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 Comparing Kraft's 'Deluxe' mac & cheese dinners,4,"Superstore sells four Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe dinners. They're all pretty good. Each uses packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder, so the cheese is never clumpy and distributes itself evenly. My husband, teenage daughter and I cooked up all four and did our own taste test. Here's what we found: The Original Cheddar flavor (Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)) is good. Plenty creamy, it tastes like a homemade version of the Kraft standard (i.e., Macaroni & Cheese Scooby Doo Shapes, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24) ). This one, the Sharp Cheddar flavor, is slightly tastier, and has a subtle smoky aftertaste. The light meal (Kraft Deluxe Macaroni & Cheese Dinner - Light, 14 oz) is pretty good, but when you try it side-by-side with the original flavor you can tell it's not as rich. Still, if you only buy this one you'll be happy. If you're counting calories go for it. The Four Cheese meal ( Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, Four Cheese Sauce, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) ) is, in our opinion, the best. With the most cheese flavor, it combines American, cheddar, colby and parmesan, and tastes similar to what you'd find at a decent restaurant. The parmesan flavor is especially noticeable. These Deluxe dinners cost about twice as much as the basic Kraft boxes, but in each case you can really taste the difference. …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful
" Tasty, no vitamins, made in China, deceptive packaging",1,"While these are tasty snacks, there is virtually no nutritional value in them. A quick check of the label shows insignificant amounts of and vitamins, even vitamin C, in any of the varieties. By insignificant, I mean less than 10% RDA. That is far below what one might find in the claimed 1-1/2 apples or pears per package. I will add that under ingredients, the only thing listed is the freeze-dried fruit on the label; there appear to be no additives, not even sugar, of any kind. While they are not strictly bad for you, this snack certainly qualifies as empty calories. Frankly you get more vitamins from a bag of potato chips. In addition, these are made in China, this is stated on each envelope. Draw your own conclusions. Finally, the package counts are deceptive. The subtexts often says ""24 count"". Then in Superstore inset says ""2 pack"". This leads a reasonable person to believe they are getting 2 24 packs for a total of 48 individual snack envelopes. In fact these are sold in packs of 12 (TWELVE) and you get two of them for a total of 24. I find this deceptive, or at best, confusing. [Update, May 2012: It appears that the description of the item has been changed to avoid the confusion as to how many you are actually getting.] To conclude, these are tasty, the texture is good, there seems to be no odd ingredients, refined sugar or artificial stuff and the serving size is reasonable. However, the utter absence of any nutritional value tells me that the process used to ""freeze-dry"" these seems different from other freeze-dry methods in that it is particularly destructive to nutrients. I find the fact that they are made in China troubling. Finally, the deceptive package counts found here in the product descriptions lead me not to purchase this again. [Note my previous acknowledgement of the improved product count description.] …",14 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Chemical supplements should be taken based on the advice of a qualified health care provider,2,"As I have problems with sleep at night and tried all sorts of things which are most commonly recommended to improve it, I tought I try this well rated product. I tried it in all the various recommended dosages. But it didn't make the slightest difference for me. Thus I guess that it probably only works if the cause of the unrest is a magnesium deficiency. Reportedly: ""With supplements, overdose is possible, however, particularly in people with poor renal function; occasionally, with use of high cathartic doses of magnesium salts, severe hypermagnesemia has been reported to occur even without renal dysfunction"". ""Safety Issues The US government has set the following upper limits for use of magnesium supplements: Children 1-3 years: 65 mg 4-8 years: 110 mg Adults: 350 mg Pregnant or Nursing Women: 350 mg"" ""It has been called nature's calcium channel blocker."" ""Magnesium assists in calcium uptake, but it also competes with dietary calcium for the same absorption site in the intestine. Excessive dietary calcium (or phosphorus) is much more likely to block magnesium absorption than vice- versa in the typical American diet. Magnesium absorption is also inhibited by excessive dietary fat, phosphate, lactose, phytates and oxalates which form insoluble compounds with magnesium. Magnesium is also lost in diarrhea, long term use of diuretics, excessive sugar intake and protein malnutrition... ... there are lower levels of minerals in food today due to depletion of the soil in modern farming methods. (23) Modern methods of milling, processing and the preservation of food cause nutrient losses, eg 85% of magnesium is removed from whole wheat in the milling."" Thus it is advisable to consult a qualified health care provider if a deficiency is suspected.

" A Treat for a Flea, perhaps!",1,"I had paid $7.81 for Natural Balance Potato and Duck Formula Dog Treats, 8 ounce bag.

When I finally got the product, I was shocked! I knew the amount of the product would be small but the size of the treat is even smaller than expectations would allow. If I had a dog the size of a small rat, it might have been a comparable treat. Be weary of what you pay for online and NEVER assume!

 Addictive and delicious!,4,"This review is going to sound very different from a normal one. First off, I would like to point out that yes, I gave it four stars on purpose. Please keep that in mind and read this very thoroughly. I hate these snacks. I hate them because they are so insanely addictive, I find it nearly impossible to ""just have one."" Invariably, I end up consuming the entire package grinning like a giddy schoolchild. Even if I put them away, I will inevitably find myself searching the package out, just so I can have one more.. and then again, and again, until the package is finally empty, and then I am sad. I hate them because of their fun, paper-thin texture, which makes it seem like you've some piece of unique candy, then it turns out to be a delicious, slightly salty, somewhat chewy snack which makes your brain scream 'Oooh, yay, SUSHI!' only for it to suddenly turn nutty in a twist which makes me want to have just one more to experience that fun crinkle of the sheets (for they are super-thin sheets of dried, roasted seaweed), the YAY of incoming sushi, that slightly chewy transformation, and then they dissolve into almost nothingness, leaving you reaching for another one. I hate them because the pack lasts about 45 minutes. An hour and a half, if I'm demonstrating exceptionally strong willpower for the day. Possibly longer if I can manage to convince someone *else* to hide them from me. I hate them because said pack gives me 40% of my Vitamin C for the day in less than half an ounce of actual dried seaweed. And something that tastes so very delicious isn't supposed to be that healthy. Bacon doesn't give vitamin C. These snacks do. That's confusing. Snacks are supposed to be guilty pleasures, not delightful dietary supplements. I hate them because the only physical store that carries them in my area is Trader Joe's, and I always end up opening the pack after they are closed. So when the package is empty and I am sad, I must wait until morning to ""get my fix"" again. I hate them because I ate an entire package while writing this review. And now it is gone. And now I am sad. Thankfully, though, I can get them here and have them delivered to my door. I might have to order a few of the six packs, though, to last me until the next order I place can arrive. I'm working out a rationing calendar that I probably won't stick to for more than an hour. And finally, I hate that I don't hate these at all, but am hopelessly and utterly addicted to them.

" All these bad reviews aren't kidding, folks - quality control on these is terrible",1,"I love a good strong cup of coffee - my favorite K-Cup is the Green Mountain Double Black Diamond Extra Bold, but I'll try any of the extra bold varieties and enjoy most of them. So the ""Fuhgeddabboudit"" flavor intrigued me and I pre-ordered a box of 36 cups. Took about a month to arrive, and I just tried it this morning. First off, the people talking about these things making messes on the counter aren't kidding. The very first cup leaked all over the place, and gave me a cup full of grounds. I was almost reluctant to try another one - something like that can't be very good for your Keurig machine - but gave it a shot. It wasn't bad, but it didn't measure up to the Double Black Diamond, and since it's essentially the same price, why shouldn't I get the stuff I really like instead? I found the flavor a little thin, lacking the richness of a DBD cup. It was okay, but nothing to write home about. The real trouble is, I'm reluctant to play K-Cup Roulette with these, given that lots of people are apparently having this same issue. I believe I'm going to contact Superstore about returning these - I'm not willing to risk screwing up my $150 Keurig with poorly-made defective K-Cups. The people at Brooklyn Bean Roastery need to pay a little more attention to quality control. There's really no excuse for this sort of rampant shoddiness in their products. UPDATE: Superstore refunded my money without even wanting me to return the K-Cups. Once again Superstore's superb customer service takes care of a problem and makes a customer happy.

The coffee maker I was using at home was your standard traditional one but I found that I kept wasting coffee and then the grounds would go stale. It wasn't a right fit maker for me. So, I bought this Keurig. The machine seems to take a longer time than my sister's (whose was more expensive) but it's fine. The reservoir on the left is handy because it means you don't have to fill up water every time you make a cup.

If you sprinkle it on a salad or similar semi dry food, you will feel the crystals, which is an unpleasant experience because it feels like you have sand in your food.

 The placebo effect is powerful,1,"I have been a doctor for 50 years. In that time there are now probably 1000 times as many medications and 500 times more medical procedures. Every one of them in order to be accepted has to undergo what is called a double blinded, placebo controlled study. An appropriate number of patients have to be recruited. In the case of Lipitor it was 10,000. 5000 took Lipitor and 5000 took the placebo, which looked exactly like the Lipitor pill. None of the patients or nurses or doctors knew who got what. All of the patients were seen often and after 5 years Pfizer broke the code and discovered that the Lipitor treated group had 50% less heart attacks, strokes and death. Every pill and every procedure has to be tested this way if it is to get on the market. FRS has never been tested this way and never will. The beneficial effects of this product depend on the placebo effect. If you believe something will benefit you because you have read many + testimonials there is a very good chance you will experience a benefit. Of course drinking a potion and expecting to, and then feeling better is a piece of cake compared to the potion actually curing cancer or healing an ulcer. You wouldn't want to go to your doctor when you are very sick and get a placebo. FRS depends on + comments of users and the celebrity endorsement of one of the greatest athletes in history.
