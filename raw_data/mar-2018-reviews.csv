 A good way to prepare and store your SACO milk,4,"I decided to switch from grocery store milk to SACO's powder for mathematical reasons. As a single lady who uses milk primarily for my tea, I rarely finish a one-gallon bottle before it sours (hate that race to use it all!), and buying half gallon containers absolutely bugs me, as it costs five bucks for two (purchased one at a time) instead of three skins for a single gallon. Plus, there's the inconvenience of schlepping to the store every few days for another half-gallon. I'm a ""stock up and go shopping as infrequently as possible"" type. Here's my solution for mixing and storing SACO milk. 1.) Buy two plastic half gallons of store milk and rinse the bottles out thoroughly when they're empty. 2.) Mix up a quart of SACO in a large Pyrex (glass) handled measuring cup and use its convenient spout to pour the milk into an empty grocery bottle. Repeat the process. (Note: having the Pyrex device clearly marked off in red sure makes measuring the powder easy. Just start with 8 oz. of SACO, then add water to the quart line.) 3.) Put the cap on the filled bottle and vigorously shake this half-gallon to assure all the SACO has dissolved. Refrigerate. (A bottom shelf is best, as it's colder.) 4.) When you get down near to the last of that bottle, mix up a second one and refrigerate it. This way, you'll always have a supply of milk on hand. Rinse out the first container when it's empty and leave the cap off. Give it a quick rinse just before re-using. I chose grocery bottles for storage as it satisfies a life-long habit of pouring milk from one. Since I'm no longer buying one gallon jugs, lifting and pouring from these smaller bottles is much less of a strain, and I have YET to throw away any milk mixed from powder because the half-gallon spoiled before I could finish it all. If you've never before experimented with instant non-fat milk but are thinking along the lines of this review's first paragraph, give SACO a shot. Those two half-gallon bottles I suggested just may be the last milk you'll ever lug home from the market. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Give it time,5,"I adopted a dog that was raised by a bunch of frat age boys. You can imagine the diet she had; Burgers, fries, ice-cream, and the cheapest dog foods on the market. No, she wasn't crazy about Newman's dog food when I switched her to it. But if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense. It takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there. It has been almost a year. My dog, Molly, is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free. She gets dry Newman's fed free style, and 4 ounces of Newman's canned every day. Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week. On another note, this diet has made doggy duty much easier. She never vomits anymore. Her scat is always firm, making her easy to clean up after. She is regular as clock-work. All these plusses make it more enjoyable to be a dog owner. …",35 out of 35 users found this review helpful
" As a Red Bull Enthusiast, I Highly Recommend This!",5,"This is an excellent, cost-effective alternative to Red Bull. The flavor is spot on--even though a purist may be able to notice the difference, I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal! For the price, two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this. Also, with this syrup, you have the option to how strong or weak you'd like to make each serving. I find that I can add less than the recommended amount and make this mix go even further. I think you would be hard-pressed to find a cheaper alternative that tastes so close to the original. …",32 out of 34 users found this review helpful
 Waste of my money.,1,"The Nutiva coconut oil was not moisturizing, which wasn't a surprise since oil doesn't moisturize, it just coats whatever you put it on. As such, once you moisturize your skin then apply coconut oil, this can help slow down the evaporation of the moisture into the air. That is great if you are less than 30 years old. At 50+ I actually want and need moisture. I used this product faithfully for 6 weeks and all it did was smooth my legs for about an hour and then they were parched and dried looking again because I hadn't actually added moisture. My legs also felt greasy and had a faint odor of coconut. I don't really want a 2-step process of using a moisturizer on my legs then coating them with coconut oil. As a face moisturizer it just made my face break out (yuuuuck!). As for the taste, I'll just say that butter has nothing to fear from this stuff. I really can't believe I fell for the hype and wasted my money with this purchase. …",8 out of 37 users found this review helpful
 My Lab loves it,5,"My Lab has always been an extremely aggressive chewer, to the point where we don't dare get him any plush chew toys any more because they'll be shredded on the first day. We got this for him when he was about 4 months old and he showed no interest in it. He much preferred the Nylabone Dura Chew Wishbone Wolf instead. This was simply too big for him and he preferred other chew toys that fit his smaller jaws better. He's now 7 months old and he's grown to the point where he LOVES this Nylabone. It's super hard so it'll last a very long time for even the most aggressive chewer. As with any hard plastic chew you need to supervise: throw it out before it gets too small. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Horrible Product and Company,1,I ordered this product for our vacation home in Colorado. We arrived in Colorado December 16th and this coffee maker stoped working January 3rd.

 Had a bad problem - now it's solved and the Babycook works fine.,4,"This is the first product review I have been compelled to put on Superstore. Bought this because most prepared baby food is disgusting and I wanted an easy way to serve fresh food to our son. This product was highly reviewed and I like gadgets so it seemed like a good fit. It worked well in the sense that it was convenient and cooked baby food, but after about 3 weeks, I noticed that the water used for steaming was brown and sweet smelling. I looked in the reservoir and noticed brown grime on all of the metal and a sickly sweet smell. I assumed (unfairly) that my mother-in-law had mistakenly put food into the reservoir hole and then was embarrassed to say anything, so I cleaned the unit with vinegar as per the instructions and tried again. We've only had the unit since Feb 2010, use it only 2-3 times a week and now had the same problem 3-4 different times. The water used to cook the food is brown and disgusting and I have cleaned (physically scraped) brown grim the reservoir multiple times. I have contacted Beaba and they have suggested that it's a descaling issue and to descale the unit once a month. I completely disagree as we have had the same coffee maker for three years and never descaled it once. I don't know if food is being spun into the reservoir or what, but at this point, we have a $150 baby food maker that we are afraid to use. What's the point of fresh baby food if it's covered in some kind of unknown detritus? Beaba has so far been unresponsive about a replacement/ repair. Will update with any new developments. Update 2/25/11- this is an update to the review above. I'm not sure, but now think the problem of the brown water had to do with not properly using the plastic cover when blending the food (aka user error) allowing particles of food to enter the water chamber and be subsequently reintroduced into the baby's food. I say this because while no one in my family would admit to not using the plastic screen when blending, as soon as I reiterated that everyone should be using it, the problem stopped and we have used the Baby food maker without incident since. So not sure what caused the problem, but it seems to have gone away recently and we are now happy with the product again. I revised my rating to 4 stars. …",84 out of 87 users found this review helpful
 Works as Advertised - Classy Product,5,"see update at end of review ****************** I was lamenting about only having frech lettuce, herbs, chives, and tomatoes from may garden during the long fall-winter-spring parts of the year. The refrigerated stuff from the grocery store goes bad right away and does not taste as good as the fresh stuff from the garden, either. Then I saw a Time Magazine page on the new AeroGrow AeroGarden, and I just had to try it out. After reading the AeroGrow website before making the purchase, I realized that buying one garden would not work for me, as the tomatoes cannot be grown in the same garden as lettuce & herbs. This is partially due to the large amount of room taken up by the tomatoes, and also because the lamp/watering cycle is different and finally because the nutrients are different. So, I bought two gardens, along with the Salad Greens seed kit and Cherry Tomato seed kit. Each garden comes with a mixed herb kit, so I figured to mix in a few herbs with the other seeds, and if they did not work, no big loss. The products came quickly and the instructions for assembly were very clear and well written with excellent diagrams. I came to realize that this somewhat pricey product at least comes from a company that produces a classy product (a rare thing these days). I found a space on a shelf beside the basement stairs, and placed both assembled gardens there. I also bought and placed a digital thermometer with maximum/minimum temperature memory readouts ($10 at Radio Shack), because I was unsure of what temperature extremes the plants might experience in that location (68-72 as it turns out). The seed kits contain pre-seeded planting pods. Each pod is basically a plastic cup shaped frame with two pieces of foam rubber inside the cup part, like two slices of bread with the seeds sandwiched between them. They simply insert into the seven holes in the top of the garden's water tank. The Salad Greens and Herbs come with seven pods per kit, while the Tomatos come with three pods plus four hole plugs-the plants are bigger so three of them take up thw whole space available. The hole plugs prevent evaporation of the water through the unoccupied holes. The water tank holds exactly one gallon of regular drinking water. Well water is not recommended, presumably because of impurities, and since I am on a well I bought two one-gallon plastic jugs of 'drinking water' at the store for 50 cents each and filled the tanks with their contents. A pump in the tank takes water and pipes it to the rim of each of the seven holes in the tank's top, and here the trickle of water flows into the foam sandwich of each seed pod. The foam stays moist and the rest of the water drips back down into the tank. The garden's 'computer' cycles the water flow on and off according to the amount recommended for the type of plant being grown. A water level sensor turns on a flashing red light when it is time to add more water to the tank. The top of the garden is a reflector with two compact-fluorescent lamps, of the variety that has the special ultraviolet (UV) coating that causes the emmitted light to resemble sunlight. The reflector rides on a vertical pole that extends up from the garden's base, so you can raise and lower the lamps as required to keep them the correct distance above the plants. The garden's 'computer' also turns the lamps on and off according to a schedule tailored to the type of plant. If using the gardens in a place where the light might be a problem at night, you can syncronize the computer so that the lights are on only during the daytime and off when you are trying to sleep. The seed kits come with little clear plastic cups that cover each pod until the seeds have germinated, then you can dispose of them. The kits also come with a bag of nutrient tablets, which you add to the water tank when the computer prompts you to by flashing a red light. The nutrients are tailored to the type of plant being grown, and there are enough of them to feed the plants during their anticipated life span. I planted one garden with five salad green (leaf lettuce) pods, plus one pod each from the Herb kit, chives and parsley. The other garden got the threee pods from the Cherry Tomato kit; two reds and one yellow variety. Each seed pod has a label that tells you how many days to wait for plants to appear after germination. All of my plants appeared like clockwork. I have had the gardens for about six weeks now, and have been enjoying salads containing lettuce, parsley and chives plus other odds and ends from the fridge, for the last two or three weeks. The lettuce and herbs are all beautiful, with no problems from bugs or too much/too little water, excessive temperatures, etc. No need to wash the plants or check for bugs or pick off bad spots, everything goes straight to the salad bowl. What a joy! Even with only five lettuce plants, I have to eat two meals including salad each day to keep up with the growth. This would easily feed two people, and if all seven salad green pods had been used, three people. The tomatoes are all doing well ahnd have been pruned according to instructions. It will be some time yet before they produce flowers, and then fruit. But based on the health of the plants, I expect a good yield. Each seed kit comes with a full color manual/booklet that covers all aspects of 'planting', germinating, feeding, pruning (if required) and then harvesting the plants. There are also photos of plants where things have gone wrong (leaves burned because the lamps were not raised up as the plants grew taller, etc) with clear instructions on how to recognize problems and correct them. Harvesting instructions clearly tell how much can be taken at a time without killing the plant, and so on. The AeroGrow gardens are a well designed, well built product with excellent documentation. All my visitors are amazed at how well the product works, and many have gone out and bought their own. I anticipate years of improved eating because of this product. ***************** Update November 2007 I used my two gardens all Winter (2006/2007) until it was time to start getting produce from my real (outdoor) garden in the Summer, at which time I put the little gardens to rest for the season. During their use, I got a large crop of cherry tomatoes, all of which were beautiful. I went through on crop of lettuce and salad greens, and when the lettuce finally bolted, I replanted with only lettuce (no chives, etc this time) and got another couple of months worth of lettuce. I have now fired them up again in the Fall, and have nice little plants popping up. Aerogrow has more seed options available now, so I have planted a more interesting kind of lettuce. …",866 out of 878 users found this review helpful

 Total rip off,1,"I'm surprised no one has noted how much water is in the package and how little fat (only 1.4%). This Weruva flavor, for example, has 85% water (only 15% dry ingredients). Here is what the FDA says on its web site: ""It is especially important to look at the moisture guarantee for canned foods, even when comparing a canned food with another canned. Under AAFCO regulations, the maximum percentage moisture content for a pet food is 78%, except for products labeled as a ""stew,"" ""in sauce,"" ""in gravy,"" or similar terms. The extra water gives the product the qualities needed to have the appropriate texture and fluidity. Some of these exempted products have been found to contain as much as 87.5% moisture. This doesn't sound like much difference until the dry matter contents are compared. For example, a product with a guarantee of 87.5% moisture contains 12.5% dry matter, only half as much as a product with a 75% moisture guarantee (25% dry matter)."" On top of the nutrition problems, Weruva is ripping you off on a cost basis (this is my comment, not the FDA's). Looking at the dry ingredients, Weruba is charging you about $2 per ounce ($1.60 per 0.825 oz dry ingredients in a 5.5 oz can). The top premium cat foods charge about $1 per ounce of dry ingredients. Avoderm is 80 cents per 1 oz dry weight. Science Diet is less than 70 cents per oz dry weight. So Weruva is nearly 3 times the cost for ingredients other than water comparing Science Diet. So if you have a lot of money to waste and don't mind your cats having dry hair and other skin problems from lack of essential fats in the diet, then go for Weruva. Otherwise, wait until they drop their price and increase the fat content. …",17 out of 28 users found this review helpful

 Unfortunately too good to be true...,3,"I bought Chocagave based on the rave reviews and ""healthy"" claims (based on being organic, raw, and using ""natural"" sweetener). It really is very tasty as a chocolate syrup and excellent for making hot chocolate. It's fairly liquid, so drizzles well on top on dessert, while not being watery (for example, I think Hershey's syrup seems runny as well as tasting yucky). The unfortunate part comes in the ""natural"" raw agave syrup used in this chocolate. Yes, I'm sure it's organic and raw like the maker claims BUT I've recently started reading about how UNNATURAL agave nectar really is. Agave is apparently a created sweetener concocted sometime in the 1990s by manufacturers using the same process as high fructose corn syrup, except with the starchy part of the agave plant rather than corn. As a result, agave nectar is made up of same unhealthy fructose (a higher percentage than high fructose corn syrup) that experts claim increases obesity, insulin resistance, etc, etc. (You've probably heard the arguments if you're looking for more natural sweeteners because you do believe high fructose corn syrup is bad). So, fructose might be a low glycemic sweetener, but I'm disappointed that the healthier alternative chocolate syrup that I bought isn't as healthy as I thought it would be. Sure, it's chocolate dessert and should be used in moderation but I was not aware that agave syrup being a ""natural"" alternative is mostly hype. Know what you're buying and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH on whether this is a good choice for you. It might be great for a diabetic without any other good options (since I think fake sweeteners taste funny and are probably even unhealthier). For me, I don't think it's really worth the additional expense to buy something I know isn't necessarily any healthier than organic chocolate with real sugar. …",12 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Really Not Enjoyable - Wanted To Love It But I Can't Stomach It.,1,"I wanted to love this because of all its positive aspects. Very low mercury. Sustainably caught. Responsible company and packaging. And - I THOUGHT it was fully caught AND packed in the USA* (*It is packed in Vietnam.) See their web site, and click on the FAQ page - it tells that info there. I love Genovo Tonno - so I thought this tuna would be even better. Wrong. You open the can and find a relatively dry hunk of tuna that smells a little cat-foodish, with some limited liquid around the lump. Dumping it out, it doesn't break up very easily, but I persisted and succeeded in making it ready for a sandwich. Taste was uninspiring. There wasn't much taste - and what was there was just ever so slightly unappealing. I couldn't finish the sandwich. I normally LOVE tuna - but not this. Thinking it was just me not liking it, I gave the rest to a person who will eat ANY brand of tuna and love it. In fact, he's one of those cast-iron stomach people who will and can eat anything. He didn't finish his sample either, because he said it was dryish and tasted unappetizing. So, it isn't just ""me"". I REALLY wanted to love this. But I can't stomach it. I'll just buy either the can of Genovo Tonno or Starkist's Yellowfin tuna in foil packets from now on. Those taste like tuna and make me want more. Granted, they're higher in mercury - full grown yellow-fin is almost as high as albacore in mercury, but I'll keep my consumption down to one packet (2.6 ounce) or can (3 ounce) a week which is below the danger limit for a very small woman. I'd rather eat less tuna that I simply LOVE, than eat a whole bunch of tuna that I can't choke down. This excerpt is quoted from the Wild Planet FAQ: ""Why are Wild Planet tuna and sardines caught in the US but packed in Vietnam? We have elected to process our 5oz cans of albacore and skipjack tuna as well as our sardines in a highly respected partner facility in Vietnam. This facility offers state-of-the-art canning expertise in an immaculately clean, accredited environment that produces higher quality finished products than any cannery we have seen in the US.""

 Best cheese curls - UPDATED: overpriced and poor quality,5,"I won't say I'm an expert in cheese curls, but these sure taste great. Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Superstore price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective. UPDATE December 11, 2009 Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag ""freshness guaranteed."" That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients). I'd give this one star today if I could. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 The King of Teas.,5,"Unquestionably the most refined of teas, Darjeeling comes from a region in the Indian (West Bengalese) Himalayas close to the Nepalese border, 7000 ft above sea level. Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November). The area's natural climate with its mixture of rainfall, sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor, and to be called ""Darjeeling,"" tea *must* have been grown *and* processed in that particular region. Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or ""flushes"": the lighter Easter harvest or first flush, and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush, which has an unmistakeably fruity, Muscatel-like note. (There is also a Summer harvest or third flush, which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest, but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties.) Twinings' variety is a second flush tea with a subtle, quintessentially Darjeeling perfume; a great introduction to this region's exquisite teas that will hopefully make you curious for more. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 In agreement......,5,"I am in agreement with some of the reviewers about the taste of this bread. This is a wonderful food, especially for those of us who are watching their carb intake. It is worth the price because you can't find this type of bread in a grocery store. Actually, I couldn't find anything similar in a health food store. Each slice is a little smaller than a regular slice of bread. It does have a firmer texture than white bread. If you are overly sensitive to some foods, double check these ingredients to be on the safe side. Ingredients are: almond flour; soy flour; bran flour; whole wheat flour; oat flour; sesame flour; unbleached flour; vital flour wheat; wheat germ; salt; anise seeds; maltisweet; cream of tartar; egg whites; soybean oil; dry yeast; soy protein; water; fiber gum; sesame seeds; dehydrated onions; dehydrated garlic; rye seeds; and poppy seeds.

 This filter works PERFECT!,5,"Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the ""old fashion way"" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size. I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Superstore, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry. The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I.

 Most like Regular Bread,5,"We used this for Pancakes Christmas morning. Personally I did not like the bean flour at first, I thought it tasted like soap. My non-gluten-free family, however, LOVED it and *insisted* I use it from now on. They said it was not as gritty as rice flour and had the texture of ""real"" bread. As for the taste, they didn't know what I was talking about. They loved it. I tried this one again, and snuck some into cookies, then tried the Bob's Red Mill GF Chocolate Cake mix with the bean flour, and it's grown on me. I stand corrected and I am actually kicking myself for not allowing myself to grow a taste for it sooner. It's opened a new world of Gluten free baking for me just when I thought I had it all together with the rice flour. I have gone back now and looked at my ""Gluten Free Gourmet"" book and have a new eye for the recipes requiring bean flour. It took our stomachs minimal time getting used to the beans, if you catch my drift, but after the first few batches of baked goods (about 3 in a week) we have adjusted. We feel better after using this mix because of the fiber and protein, as opposed to all that starch and empty carbs of the the white rice flour. I don't have to pass round the laxative anymore (a common reality of switching to the GF diet.) Make some pancakes (2 cups of the flour mix, 1 tsp baking soda, an egg, 1/4 cup oil, and 1/2 tsp xantham gum--thin with water or milk to desired consistency)and ease yourself into it with butter and syrup. Of course the flour smells like beans (duh), but the flavor of the beans is mild after it has been cooked. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Be patient,3,"Unless you are already familiar with working with sourdough and know what you are doing (which I didn't), you need to be very patient and experiment with this product. I have now been working with the starter for about a month and I am still trying to get a loaf of sourdough bread similar to an 'artisian bread' from the market. I have tried a variety of receipies; those provide and from the internet. The sourdough flavor varies greatly with the receipe. The flavor has developed and the starter become more active the longer I have worked with it. This morning I found my overnight rise spilling over into the (cool) oven where I had it rising. I had no idea how long it took to make a loaf of sourdough bread; almost 16 hour using the provided receipe. It did produce an excellent batch of sourdough pancakes, but still a long process. Keep trying! The product says free shipping, but for some reason I paid more for shipping ($4.49) than I did for the starter ($2.99). The product arrived in a standard business envelope with about two ounces of dry starter. I used about half (as per instructions) to create my starter. The instructions are primative and poorly formatted for use in the kicthen. The ad says you get a 12 page booklet, I got 3 - 8.5 X 11 single sided pages. And the instructions do not provide an email address for the ""free unlimited tech support."" I found the same basic bread receipe on epicurious which is much easier to read and follow. You can also find receipies for starter on the internet. However, I am hoping that this one will produce something more like the authentic San Franciso sourdough as advertised. So 3 Stars. It would be 4 but for the shipping cost and instructions, and perhaps 5 when I figure out what I am doing. …",11 out of 19 users found this review helpful

I can find this at my local grocery store whereas I have to order Cafe Du Monde through Superstore.

Remember as with all coffee with chicory to use less then you would normal coffee, perhaps half of what you normally would. Using less you will still get a dark coffee as it is almost impossible to get a light coffee with this. That being said, it still contains less caffeine as normal coffee and is certainly less bitter and taste less acidic. Try this today if you are like me and love a good, bold, robust, great tasting coffee with chicory. You will not be disappointed. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Not Fresh - High hopes but doesn't measure up,3,"Saffron is unusually difficult to find in my local market so I've been trying out several different varieties available here on Superstore...nothing beats the flavor of Saffron! I had high hopes for this one since it is packaged in an acrylic box (unlike Frontier brands which is a competitively priced slightly more expensive version that uses pouches that smell like a pool liner - argh!). The price was suspiciously low so I thought I'd give it a try with the hope of finding an affordable alternative. Unfortunately this simply doesn't measure up even to that of the Frontier brand. While the packaging is STRONGLY preferred...this simply wasn't fresh enough. The flavor was a bit more mild and it required more than double the quantity I've been using for a simple rice dish with the other brand. Notice the expiration date...2017. As of this writing in early 2010 it is good to know the use by date is not near. On the other hand, a seven year window leaves something to be desired. Bottom Line - Preferred packaging but less fresh than ""other"" brand sold here on Superstore. However, other brand uses less desirable liner that lingers.

" The Bursting Flavor and Healing Power of Blessedly Beautiful, Simple Salt Crystals",5,"These crystals have the minerals intact, which is vital to the salt benefit and function. I don't know when or why purveyors of salt began removing the natural mineral content, but that action involved a frightening ignorance. For certain types of specific health issues (see below), the minerals in the sea salt crystals seem to work better for me in their crystalline (or coarse) form, than when I grind the salt, as I do for cooking or table usage salt. As others have noted, mineral-rich, coarse-sea-salt freshly grinded onto food is much crisper in its culinary effect, more satisfying to the taste buds, than pre-granulated, plain table salt (which has the minerals removed, minerals found naturally in sea salt and which enhance both health benefits and flavor bursts). Also, old style, granulated table salt has an added disadvantage from the fairly recent addition of a variety of anti-caking chemicals, some of which contain aluminum (silicoaluminate)... which I'm concerned may be a brain cell deteriorative, possibly at baseline cause for Alzheimer's. If I take a pinch of salt crystals (coarse sea salt contains crystals) 2 or sometimes 4 times per day, and place them in my mouth, moving them around to dissolve the salt in saliva on my teeth and gums, I find that both teeth and gums retain a much higher degree of health. I had begun having minor tooth aches periodically, and this practice has alleviated that. As noted above, I'm 60-years-old; and with a debilitating liver ailment since I was 9, I find that when I have an attack of severe abdominal and back muscle cramps (which I get fairly frequently), a pinch of sea salt crystals in my mouth will stop those cramps. In fact, when I take small amounts of sea salt crystals regularly enough, I don't get those cramps at all. The cause and effect is immediate and direct, so I know this works for me. From my experience, plain table salt, or even sea salt without the mineral content will not give this beneficial effect. (I'm guessing it's the magnesium content which works here, though, it might be the wholeness of the natural balance of the particular mineral group within unadulterated salt). Of course, I also drink one, preferably two glasses of water along with the salt crystals, ingesting the water before, after, or both. I learned about the many benefits of sea salt crystals (with the natural mineral content not having been leached away in well meaning ignorance) from Dr. Batmanghelidj's book Cancer & Depression: Their Common Cause & Natural Cure . I recommend that book very highly and hope to be able to review it also. Dr Batman's books explain how, when, why, and how much water the body needs for optimum health, and sea salt crystals are a vital part of that program. Note that in this book he explains also how, when, and why a person can take too much salt and water. I suppose I'm ""lucky"" that I have a barometer for sea salt crystal needs. When I'm not taking enough the cramps return. During hot weather (or under other dehydrating conditions) when the body loses more salt and water, I have to increase the intake of both. As far as I recall, Dr. Batman hadn't mentioned the connection of sea salt to alleviate regular large muscle cramping. That I discovered this on my own after I had been taking the sea salt regularly, due to reading Dr. Batman's book. Bless this man for standing up to so many medical fallacies which are literally creating diseases, then causing addiction to high cost medications which do NOT cure the ailment, but add several other ailments into a complex medical condition which piles prescriptions on top of prescriptions. My thanks to Superstore for providing a variety of excellent sea salt products in coarse, crystalline form.

 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",19 out of 23 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 Great taste - poor packaging wastes k-cups,3,"I love the taste of this coffee. But apparently they have poor quality control. These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly. You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to. Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem. It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens.

For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Superstore). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it. For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product. If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it! …",51 out of 59 users found this review helpful

 The food tastes delicious!! Best salt we ever used,5,"I bought this salt after reading Suzanne Somer's books. It turned out to be great because this salt does contain more minerals than ""NA/CL"", meaning you get a supply of important nutrients and does not have to ingest anti-caking ingredients in regular salt.

 Great Long Lasting NRG/ Energy... Take the Right Dosage!,5,"I picked this up at Costco at a pretty good deal after seeing this here. Best next thing to my old Vivarin fix but better as it is in somewhat of a food form without the crash. Do NOT take this more than the recommended 5 Hour intervals! First you'll be wired and more on the EDGE than anything. Taking two of these in less than 9 or 10 hours was a shock to my system and it actually knocked me out for a minute, but after that I was wired more than anything, almost ready to fly!! Again great booster, maybe too great sometimes. You gotta remember this is basically a double shot of the regular.

 Calm Plus Calcium,5,I LOVE this product. I would do without food before I would do without this. The benefits are multiple - it helps keep you regular and also helps take the stress and tension out of your muscles. It does take 4-6 weeks to notice full change in your muscles. I certainly don't feel the stress in my upper back the way I use to - and I still do the same type of computer work day in and day out. I HIGHLY recommend this product.

 Gold standard...Years of research on my part...,5,"When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my ""baby"" each day. Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life... I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption. I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me) At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud. Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods. The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label. Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this! Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic. I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about. Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out... (p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them! But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!) So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.) Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest... if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal. This is hard to find. So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet. He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!) I, personally, have helped friends CURE ""health"" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept ""treating"" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and ""cured"" them! Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both. I am a raving fan. and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it. …",119 out of 120 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 15 users found this review helpful

" Not bad, not great either.",3,"I purchased this coffee because both the Newman's Own and Sumatran Reserve were priced up near $1 per k-cup this month, and I needed something dark and bold to replace them until the prices came back down. This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish. The caffeine content is acceptable. The package could have been treated a little better during shipping as there were lots of dents, crushed corners and sides, and evidence of bending on the sides of the k-cups. None of the cups have thus far shown a broken seal though. Overall this is an acceptable extra bold style k-cup, but there are better options out there. My favorites have been the Newman's Own and the Sumatran Reserve. I haven't tried the Black Diamond K-cups as they are a bit pricey right now also. I'll probably end up using a coupon and buying my preferred flavors in a brick and mortar store nearby for a better price, or ordering some Coffee People 50-count extra bold flavors. Their boxes have had pretty stable pricing for the past 6 months or so. If you are out of options, this is a cheaper substitute for a pricier extra bold flavor. I wish Superstore could sort out their supply issues and keep K-cup prices a little more stable. Lastly, I wouldn't buy these again if I had other similar priced options. TL;DR - These are okay, but go for other extra bold flavors if they are priced about the same. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

We prefer our oatmeal thicker than standard porridge and this is more than enough for 4. The thickest I have made it is 3.5 cups water to 1.25 cups oat groats. The pecan meal adds nutty flavor.

 Love at first bite!  Tongue-puckering tang and crunch!,5,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy. I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten. It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since. Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly. I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch. Isn't that poetic? As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C. My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches. I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch. Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course. My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them. That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids! For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far. It isn't easy, but ... Have I told you how much I love them?

 The Best Bar on the Market Hands Down,5,"Going on Weight Watchers has its challenges. I have lost about 40 lbs to date and it has been good but I find that many of the products recommended by them have too much sugar. For example, everyone suggested Fiber One Bars as a snack because they are low in points. I noticed though that they spiked my blood sugar and stalled my weight loss. I switched to Extend Bars and boy, what a difference! I eat one of these every day, some times two. I really like them before bed or in the morning to help stabilize my blood sugar (I am hypoglycemic, pre-diabetic). I never have trouble eating breakfast now, these with a glass of skim milk or coffee and milk and a piece of fruit and I am good to go until lunch. What is the difference between Extend Bars and the rest on the market? First, they are only a 150 calories with only 3 grams of fat but 11 grams of protein per bar. They also have 5 grams of fiber, just enough to help digestion, without causing stomach discomfort. (Something I can not say about some of the others on the market!) I can not find another bar on the market to match those protein and fiber stats for the little calories and fat exchange. Also, the glycemic index is low because this bar contains a special slow digesting corn starch created from a corn grain that is different than the normal variety. It does not allow the blood sugar to spike, which can stall weight loss. This is the number one selling point for me, high protein and low glycemic... Finally because I really believe we eat WAY too many processed carbs in our diet, this satisfied me in another area, it has a low net carb ratio, and does it WITHOUT the use of high levels of sugar alcohol. There are only 4 grams of sugar alcohol per bar, that is completely different than any other low carb bar on the market. I really like the Chocolate and Peanut Butter, but not too wild about the berry and apple ones though. These taste exactly like the South Beach Cereal Bars, just less sweet. Give them a chance, they are not going to be as sweet as other things on the market...but they are great with coffee or milk...helps them not be too dry. Be sure to drink plenty of water as will any high fiber bar. …",51 out of 51 users found this review helpful

 Would not buy again,1,"I love oatmeal and I usually eat the Archer Farms organic brand from Target. Thought I'd give these a go, but it was nasty. I couldn't make myself choke down the whole carton. This was the second flavor I tried -- the first was the Cherry Pistachio, which was even worse and gave me a stomach ache for the rest of the day.

I don't know how else to describe it. Something that doesn't taste like oatmeal or fruit or nuts. Maybe it's from the ""natural flavors""? Of course, individual experiences will vary from mine. But I think I'll stick with the old-fashioned way. It's a lot cheaper and healthier to just make regular oatmeal and add your own ""flavors"" -- fruit, nuts, maple syrup, whatever -- and it won't leave a bunch of little cartons to recycle or go in the landfill. …",10 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Best Can Tuna I have ever tasted and healthy/sustainable,5,"My fiance pointed out to me the many downsides to regular canned tuna, from high mercury to one lb of by-catch of other fish and sea turtles for every lb of tuna caught the typical, ""sea chicken"" commercial way (note, 1:1 !). Even though dolphins have been pretty much eliminated as by-catch in US sold tuna, much other sea life has not. The only alternative to get much lower mercury and very low by-catch is by troll or pole catching. American Tuna and Wild Planet apply these techniques (see American's www site for interesting videos of the work intensive catching process by pole). I tried both and even though I liked Wild Planet Tuna over ""regular"" canned tuna, American Tuna is even better and especially fresher tasting! Its so good it was hard to believe it came out of a can when we first tried. Other benefits of American over Wild Planet is the even lower, ~ 1/2 mercury level compared to Wild Planet, and that it is not just caught in the US but also canned here, whereas Wild Planet apparently ships their US caught tuna to Vietnam for canning and then ships it back!? There is a significant price difference but we have decided to eat a bit less tuna but when we do to get the best.

" Mixed results, and some tips",3,"I have three older cats who take arthritis pills. One also takes a thyroid pill. I decided to try the pill pockets. For the first month or so, they all loved them, and they made it easy to give the pills. However, after three months: One cat still loves them. I have to watch her carefully or she will steal the pills from the others. One cat has figured out how to eat around the pill. One cat sometimes takes them, but at other times just sniffs the pocket and skips it. I have figured out a few tricks that help: There are two types of pockets for cats: chicken and salmon. The chicken is slightly larger and more pliable and works better with larger pills. However, I think that the cats find the salmon tastier. Get another cat treat and stick it to the side of the pill pocket. Then place the pocket so the treat faces down. My finicky cat is much more likely to eat the whole thing that way. The pill pocket still helps with the cat who eats around it. After she eats the pill pocket, it is easier to shove the pill down her throat. She is more likely to swallow it instead of spitting it out if it tastes of pill pocket. If you have two pills, try to fit them both in one pocket. Giving the cat fewer pockets will make it seem more of a treat. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Trio bars are the best,5,"Mrs. May's Trio bars are my favorite snack/energy bars. I love them. They come in four flavors. Tropical is my least favorite of those flavors, but I still really like it, just not as much as the others. The tropical flavor is more subtle than the other flavors; there isn't a strong flavor from any of the tropical fruits contained in it. So if you enjoy the nuts and seeds and don't want a strong fruit component coming through, you might like the tropical ones best. The name comes from the ingredients. The bars have a trio of trios: 3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits. The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors. The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios. The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower. The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don't really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the ""glue"" that holds all the other ingredients together. The ""third"" fruit in the tropical flavor is actually three tropical fruits: pineapple, mango and papaya. I can't taste any distinct flavor of pineapple and the mango and papaya are very light. The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt. These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy. The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher. They also have no preservatives. If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts. Because of the nuts, they have 12 grams of fat per bar, but I've been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is ""good"" fat. The label says there is 1.5 grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated. To round out the rest of the nutrition facts: calories, 170; total carbs, 14g; dietary fiber, 2g; sugars, 6g; protein, 5g; cholesterol, 0g; trans fat, 0g; and sodium, 45mg. I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have. They are low sodium but high in taste and they are really satisfying. I used to get granola bars but these are so much better. I'd rather eat my least favorite flavor of these than just about any other bar. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Unhealthy... Look at the Ingredients,1,"I fed my dog Iams Proactive Health for five years before realizing that it is a very unhealthy, low-quality, and species-innappropriate dog food. The package states ""No fillers."" However, take a look at the first five ingredients...chicken, corn meal, ground whole grain sorghum, chicken byproduct meal, dried beet pulp. The last four of the first five ingredients are fillers! Also, the first ingredient, chicken, probably occupies a lower position on the list because, after cooking, most of the moisture is lost and chicken is about 80% moisture. [1][2] As to being species-inappropriate, have you ever heard of a wolf attacking a corn stalk? After I started researching dog food, I switched my dog to Taste of the Wild, a grain-free kibble, and Bravo Balance, raw dog food. When my dog was eating Iams, she often left food in her bowl for several hours. Now she eats her food as soon as I give it to her. Also, her coat is softer and she doesn't get constipated anymore (she did every now and then eating Iams). Yes, Iams is ""vet-recommended"" and my vet approved of it. However, I have reason to believe that many vets have been improperly and undereducated in nutrition, and the education that they do receive is biased. Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc., which makes ""Hill's Science Diet"" with similar ingredients to Iams, has created and distributes a nutrition curriculum to vet schools around the world. They also administer the Hill's vet school graduate feeding program, which provides pet food to students at no charge that they can resell for a profit. In addition to providing course materials to veterinary students, Hills's, Iams, Purina, and other well-known manufacturers also offer additional perks for students. [3][4] Please, do not believe pet food companies' claims without looking at the ingredients for yourself! It's a pay now or pay later situation. If you feed your dog a high-quality, wholesome food now you will have to pay less in vet bills later.

" What's With the ""Bourbon"" Vanilla Appellation?",2,"First of all, the product does not look as pictured online. The label is different. Because I was thinking I was getting a new and different product from what I had in my cupboard, I ordered it, but alas, when it came it was the same Rodelle vanilla I've used in a 16 oz. bottle for the past 5 years with the same, to my eyes, tired label. This vanilla is labeled ""bourbon"". What is that all about? I'm simply annoyed. My old Rodelle with the same label, is not sub-labeled ""bourbon"". This new stuff smells like vanilla, but who knows what someone has fiddled with in manufacturing this product. Do not order this vanilla if you want truth in advertising.

While I don't regret this purchase, because I needed a high-heat cooking oil (and the expeller-pressed oil that I have is only suitable for medium-heat cooking), my hopes are somewhat dashed. I was hoping that I could use this Gold Label as a substitute for butter on toast, etc., but the taste is so bland it could not possibly substitute for butter on toast.

 Surprise Benefit in 2 days,5,"I heard about Mangosteen Juice from my daughter (a Reiki Master and massage therapist) and a friend who is involved in alternative medicines. I liked what I read about mangosteen100 by Genesis Today, so I decided to order some. I ordered 2 different brands to compare. mangosteen100 by Genesis Today arrived first. I took a 2oz dose before supper and 3 doses the next day. The following morning I was fixing breakfast and all of a sudden it dawned on me that my low back pain that I have had for about 40 years, was gone. That sold me! Everything else it fixes is gravy. The other brand, which I tried for the next 4 days lost whatever Genesis Today's Mangosteen100 had gained to eliminate my low back pain. The pain was back. There are a lot of imitations out there that play with adding flavor which dilutes the Mangosten and is in a smaler bottle--that means less medicinal benefit per dose and fewer doses per bottle. I think I found a winner. By the way, when I went back to the orginal (first) product, the pain was gone again unless I really overdue it. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Flawed design,1,"The design of this product is fatally flawed. Notice on all manual drip coffee makers the ridges on the sides and around the hole. This keeps the filter just far enough away from the filter to let coffee flow. This one has ridges, but they are pathetic. If fact, it would be impossible to create deep enough ridges out of porcelain to do the job. The result is a drip filter that takes FOREVER to flow, to the point of being unusable. You can stick something in the base to break the seal of the filter with the sides, and that helps, but what a pain. I can't believe Melita keeps this thing on the market. They must not test their products. It's very frustrating. …",12 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Refuting the 2-Star Review.,5,"Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation. So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked ""natural""), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those. Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.

 Not a Bad Fat Anymore,5,"Excellent product!! I have found that coconut oil can be used in any way you would use oil or butter.

(All the benefits of olive oil are destroyed with high heat). It doesn't need refrigeration----another plus. Tastes great on toast. Too bad the good things about coconut oil have been surpressed for so many years.

 The absolute best so far!,5,"I really like Coffee People Donut Shop coffee, but since it is a tad on the weak side for my tastes, I decided to try the Coffee People XBold variety pack. For reference, I have a Keurig B66 which has 3 cup sizes (5.25, 7.25, 9.25oz), and I always use one K-cup for one 9.25oz cup, and I drink it black. I don't make smaller cups to make it stronger, nor do I run extra water to make it weaker. I judge each k-cup in 9.25oz. It should also be noted that I use spring water exclusively in my machine; done for both taste and machine longevity. (The tap water where I live is brutal. Life span of a water heater is 5-8 years.) I tend to like full-bodied/full-flavored coffee (that doesn't always mean ""strong""). Therefore, I tend to like the dark roasts better, which is why I find Donut Shop just a bit lacking (but I like it enough that I still drink it). After trying the variety pack (and having since bought this item by itself as verified above), I can honestly say that by far my new favorite K-Cup is Jet Fuel (and I've tried at least 15-20 different varieties, not including flavored or decaf coffee). It has full flavor that is really good, but has no ""strong"" characteristics IMO (i.e. bitter, burnt, dense, etc.). When I took the first sip of Jet Fuel, I immediately thought, ""Wow, this is good coffee!"" Highly recommended if you like a full-bodied coffee that doesn't have any bitterness or burnt characteristics, and is not too dense. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful

Part of that change was finding a sweentner which would not interfere with blood glucose levels much, and tasted good. I went to a health food store, and this product was recommended.

It was like the old articifial sweeteners. I tried using less another time, but the result was the same. I sweetened some tea with it, and that wasn't bad. So, overall, it takes some getting used to.

Probably my own fault; I should have specified ""No MSG"", except it never occurred to me that a package with this many bad chemicals wouldn't be labelled somewhere! Outside of any of this, the dashi has none of the complexity or subtlety you hope for in a dashi base. I know if I want all of that, I need to make it from scratch, but since purchasing this I've tried several non-MSG brands and all of them are better.

 The Hottest of the Hot (for now),4,"It seems like there is a new ""Hottest Pepper in the World"" every couple of years or so. Not too long ago it was the Red Savina® Habanero with a Scoville heat rating of 577,000 units. Now it is the Naga Jolokia (also known as the Naga Morris, Nai Miris, Bih Jolokia and Bhut Jolokia, etc.) with a whopping 1,001,304 Scoville Heat Units according to the New Mexico State University Chile Pepper Institute. In February 2007, Guinness World Records certified the Bhut Jolokia (aka Naga Jolokia) as the hottest pepper in the world. It is reportedly called the ""Ghost Pepper"" because after one bite of the pepper you ""give up the ghost"". Now Dave's Gourmet has made a sauce from this serious pepper. This is nothing to fool around with, it will cause pain, a lot of pain. So why would anybody want a sauce that hot (other than for bravado)? I for one like the taste. It is a little smokier that Habanero. I also use it in sauces where I want heat but not the red color of chili peppers, such as a cream based sauce. Since it only takes a drop to give me the heat that I want it will hardly change the color of a white sauce. My only reservations about it is that it contains hot pepper extract (which is what they call the stuff that they spray in the eyes of criminals). I've seen hot pepper extract for sale as a commercial additive. It's low on flavor but big on heat. Was this added to give the sauce extra pain inducing heat while using fewer actual Jolokia peppers? I don't know but it makes you think. Dave also has a special edition sauce that uses the Bhut Jolokia pepper and cost about four times more than this one does. I like this sauce, but use with caution. …",32 out of 34 users found this review helpful

The directions called for rehydrating 1 cup of TVP with 7/8 cup boiling water. As soon as the boiling water hit the TVP a smell exactly the same as chicken poo came wafting up from the bowl. All the bowl contained was TVP and boiling water but the smell made me gag. I covered the bowl with a plate while the TVP soaked for 10 minutes as directed on the package. When I removed the cover the smell burst forth like chicken poo from hell! I hoped the smell would go away when I added the TVP to the pasta, red sauce, and mushrooms but it didn't.

 An acquired taste,3,"Rediburger is best sliced thin and fried. Served on a whole wheat bun with tomatoes, lettuce ( or better yet mustand greens), pickles, mayo, and cheese if you like it. For some reason it tasted better when I ate it back in the 70's (maybe my taste buds are just getting old). They reformulate these vege recipes from time to time I think. I used to love them! As for shipping, it was superb and delivered promptly right to my door by the UPS folks! I prefer the vege hot dogs ""Vege links"" or ""Linketts"" a 5 star for my tastes and the swiss steaks, a 5 star also. Vege meat is an acquired taste but alot better than risking disease from meat these days. If you have to watch your sodium they can be a problem, but no worse than most packaged foods.
