 A *must-have* household staple,5,"This sauce is medium heat for everyday use. It has an excellent roasted pepper flavor, and there is *NO VINEGAR* to get in the way. Consequently, you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce...versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it. An every-day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue. This is not a boutique novelty, it's a household staple. The 32 oz. size is the right size for a hot sauce household. You want good? Try Tapatio on cottage cheese. You'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again, I promise. I use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream, but my personal favorite applications of Tapatio are: eggs potatoes pizza anything creole (forget tabasco!) cottage cheese most rice mac cheese and of course...Mex In my opinion, this is the best sauce in your local grocery store. …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Careful!  Dogs can CHOKE and DIE on these!,1,"My 5 month old french bulldog puppy almost died on the first bone tonight. He chewed it down and attempted to swallow a piece that was too big to go down his throat. When he began gagging and throwing up I had to stick my hand down his throat to push the lodged bone into his stomach. VERY scary and upset me greatly. I do NOT recommend these bones. There is even a choking warning on the back in small writing. Keep your pet safe and purchase MUCH BIGGER bones for them, and take away anything too small so they cannot choke or get hurt. …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Stevia Extract,5,"I use stevia extract every day instead of sugar. This product is dependable. By the pound, it is far cheaper than the 1 ounce bottles sold in stores. I cook for diabetic people and this eliminates the sugar problem. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I will buy again. For those unfamiliar with the amount to use - use 1/2 teaspoon of extract instead of 1 cup of granulated sugar. …",33 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 Love it or Hate it?,5,"This cereal must be like one of those ""cilantro things"". Maybe some people have tastebuds that make it taste like cardboard and some people love it. I'm on the ""love it"" side so I felt I had to write a review. I think the flakes have a delicious toasty flavor and it always seems to have plenty of raisins (?). My kids like it too. This product is all natural, really, and has a great, old-fashioned toasted grain flavor. Maybe the other reviewers are used to eating chemicals for breakfast. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Not in a glass container,2,"I had high hopes for this coconut oil. What is not to love? Organic, Extra Virgin, decent price, subscribe and save, glass container???? but there in lies the problem, I was hoping from the image in the listing that this coconut oil was packaged in glass, but alas it arrived in a black plastic container, with the safety seal damaged nonetheless, so I had to send it back. Oh well, I hope it is BPA free at least, but I couldn't see that indicated anywhere? So, if you are looking at this listing hoping to get coconut oil in a glass container, look elsewhere. …",17 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Best Brand for Coconut Oil,5,"Update: February 2012 I told my friend about how to use this product for cooking and how it was helpful for weight loss result - May 2012 she has lost 2 dress sizes and she has more energy. Before this she was not able to successfully lose the weight. Nutiva Organic extra virgin (actually in the field of coconut oil there is no distinction between virgin and extra virgin like the grades of olive oil)is the best coconut oil brand for quality due to its true essence of coconut flavor. This is one of the very few companies that keep with the tradition of producing it cold pressed by hand which allows the oil to maintain all of its nutritional benefits. It's not an over powering oil. It has a clean, tropical, nutty scent and delicate flavor. It is good for baking, sauteeing, frying, for smoothies, spreadable on bread/pancakes, great for creating frosting, and making dipping chocolate or added with chocolate for fondue, taken orally for weight loss, lip gloss, hot oil treatment for hair, hair dress, massage oil, skin moisturizer, nail/cuticle conditioner, make up remover, a combatant for vaginal/infections due to coconut's antiviral properties, used to moisten the inner nasal membrane to protect against dryness, and great (especially when combined with olive oil)for making bars of soap. Coconut oil is extremely beneficial for your health because it has both short and medium chain fatty acids which promotes weight loss, increased metabolism, and healthy skin. Many experience the lowering of bad cholestorol while consuming. It is the secret ingredient I use for sauteeing broccoli and cauliflower with a hint of ginger and nutmeg. I use it for salmon, lamb, chicken, eggs (yum), and it brings out such a dimension to food. I prefer it to butter and olive oil in cooking when I have it on hand. My cakes, brownies, quick breads turn out moister with coconut oil and rise better. Because it liquifies beyond 72degress F it may be necessary to combine coconut oil with a heavier fat (such as butter) when baking cookies. Due to it's properties, coconut oil absorbs nicely into one's hair to soften it and combat frizziness. After trying other brands of coconut oil, none has compared to the remarkable pureness and flavor of Nutiva. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" Some are good, some are not so much.",4,"Some of the flavors we have tried: Diet Cola I do not like diet cola. I don't like diet Coke, diet Pepsi or diet other drinks. We bought this flavor so we could make diet drinks for someone who might like a diet cola when we were making our own soda. However, this is really one of the better diet drinks that I have tried. If you make your own soda, this is a good one to try. Orange This is the best one by far of all of the flavors we have tried. This flavor tastes just like the fanta orange soda. We love this one. Cola This cola flavoring is ok. It's not great. You can easily make simple syrups that will not be a cola flavor but will taste much better than this flavor. This is the equivalent of RC Cola. Ok but it's not near as good as other name brand colas. …",14 out of 17 users found this review helpful

After 6 months, it had toyed a great deal with my endocrine system. The toxic limit of fluoride is 1 mg per liter, and this tea exceeds 8.

 Newman's Own Organics Dog food,5,"Our dog is 13 years old and for the last couple of years, his stomach has become particularly sensitive. We tried various brands of dog food before settling on Newman's Own. Our dog loves it and has not had any more trouble with his stomach. It is hard to find though.

 I can't believe I ever made soy milk without this bag!,5,"After using cheesecloth AND a small mesh strainer to make soy milk I can't believe there was something like this out there all along. I went from having to strain the milk 4 times to only once. It cut the time required to make soy milk in half and less dishes required for all of the pouring back and forth. It fits perfectly on the old thermos (the plastic kind for taking water or other cold liquids not the coffee type) that is about 5-6"" across and is exactly the same height. If I were using a large bowl to make the milk I would probably get the gallon bag but this one fits perfect on the top of a pitcher or thermos. The clean-up was much easier than cleaning cheesecloth as well. Nothing stuck in the bag like it does in the cheesecloth so I just dropped the mess into a bowl, rinsed the inside of the bag and hung it up on my kitchen towel hook. I would recommend this product to anyone. ps: It would be a great bag for rinsing sprouts as well. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful

" Outstanding flavor, great price!",5,"After years of using Starbuck's decaf and regular single serving espresso pods, I finally found a substitute that's more economical and MUCH better tasting.<p>I've used three different brands of pods in my Starbuck's Barista machine, and have found that the quality of the pod and the flavor of the espresso inside is, by far, the best in the Espressione pods. The flavor is more full bodied and stronger than in the Starbuck's pods. I actually use one pod to make two shots of espresso, and the flavor is more intense than when I buy my specialty drinks from Starbucks or other coffee houses.<p>Also, the pod itself is of very high quality. Each pod is individually wrapped in an airtight, hard foil wrapper, and I've never opened a package yet that contained a torn pod with coffee spilling out. Such is not the case with other lesser brands.<p>The tab on each pod is also handy, making it easier to switch out a hot spent pod with a new one when making a second round of espresso. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Don't be fooled by EntirelyPets $2.99 Price for these!,1,"I ordered three sets of these from EntirelyPets. I even called them to confirm that the $2.99 price was in fact for 24 of these and was told YES. When my order arrived, it had only one per set, not 24. They keep changing their price here from $2.99 with $5.98 shipping to $66.00 with free shipping. It seems like a bait and switch to get more orders because if you look at their reviews, you'll find that others also purchased these for $2.99 for 24 and received only one. I even called to confirm and was told I'd get what is stated, yet I didn't. When I followed up with them after receiving my order, I was told it was a ""price mistake"". When a vendor keeps making the same ""pricing mistake"" over and over, you have to start to wonder if it's a mistake or a bait and switch. The item is fine, but not worth $2.99 plus $5.98 shipping for ONE, especially when the site specifically states that it is for 24 and even their own customer service stated I would receive 24 per set ordered. I am submitting this review to warn others and to highlight to Superstore what EntirelyPets is doing. …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 love the natural ingredients!,5,"I only feed my dog organic products treats and I love the ingredients in these treats. Even better, my dogs love them too. They are small and perfect for training. Although I think they smell repulsive my labs cannot get enough of them. They will harden over time, they are super-moist to begin with. But I have found that they stay fresh much longer if you keep them in the refrigerator I also recommend the american chicken jerky that comes with the skin and coat optimizer, Showstopper (Unflavored) 4 Lbs. + Free American Chicken Jerky - 3 Oz. . Another favorite in this household, they go crazy when they see the bag. The jerky does come in much bigger pieces but they are easy to break into two, which I usually do and share half with each dog. Now if I only watched my own diet as much as I did my dogs, I may actually get somewhere, lol. One thing is for sure, Superstore definitely has the best prices for pet treats and supplies. I've seen these products at the store marked up almost double! Cannot say that about everything Superstore carries but for these categories they seem to have cornered the market. …",28 out of 28 users found this review helpful
 Great Start for a Mexican Meal,5,"The Hormel Beef Tamales are are an old standby on the pantry shelf. They are not highly spiced, in fact they are on the bland side.

 Sticking with original Pop Chips,1,"I am a HUGE fan of Pop Chips and buy them regularly so I was excited to see them add a new product to their line. I was so excited I went ahead and ordered bulk from Superstore. Unfortunately, it was wasted money. They taste very odd. I wish I had a better word to describe it. When I realized I didn't like them I put them in the community kitchen at work for anyone who was interested. Word has gotten around from those who tried them and also didn't like them and now they're just sitting in there. :-( To be clear, I absolutely LOVE regular Pop Chips.

 Finally a real gluten-free all purpose flour,5,"With a husband who has been on a gluten-free diet for twenty years, I've tried just about every alternative I could find to substitute for ""all purpose flour"" in traditional recipes, including mixing my own from a vast array of other flours. Some were OK, some failed in texture, some failed in taste, some were downright inedible. With Beth's Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour, I've finally found a product that works in most of the cookies, tea breads, muffins, and so on that we all enjoy, and is also affordable for everyday use. It can be substituted in an equal quantity just about anywhere a recipe calls for ""all purpose flour"" - obviously you'll need to experiment if you use it for yeast breads. Oh, and by the way, it doesn't taste ""gluten-free"". We had a very merry Christmas at our house! …",47 out of 48 users found this review helpful
 A blast (of sugar) from the past.,3,"Quisp is 3'1"" tall, 43 pounds (on Earth) and hails from the Planet Q. Quisp, the cereal, was launched by Quaker Oats in 1965. The creation of animator Jay Ward (Rocky & Bullwinkle), Quisp and his nemesis Quake went head-to-head to determine which was spokesperson for the superior cereal brand. In 1970, Quisp won the battle. Quake went back underground (he was portrayed as a miner). Quake got a makeover, ditching his mining helmet for an Austrailian style brim and fronting the new cereal Quangaroos. Quisp eventually won that battle as well. Due to low sales, Quisp was discontinued several years later only to return in the 1990's as the ""first internet cereal"", being sold directly through Quaker's website. The brand has made it's way back to the shelves of some discount stores in the northeast, but for the majority of us it's still only available on the internet. As for the cereal itself, it's in the Cap'n Crunch vein of sugar, sugar and more sugar. Nothing spectacular.

 This water is making a difference for me,5,"This water tastes good, and after drinking it for a few weeks, it has most certainly helped with my indigestion and acid reflux. I also feel like I can drink more of it without getting bloated than I did with Evian. It tastes smooth and does well at quenching my thirst, better than some other bottled waters I have tried. I have now subscribed to a couple of cases of this direct from Superstore each month, as the price per liter works out less than I was paying for Evian from the store on a regular basis, and with a subcription, the shipping is always free. Hard to beat that. Not sure why anyone would want to get same size bottles from the NutriCity listing for this on Superstore, as the price listed there is currently listed at $66.33, and no option to use Superstore prime or to be able to subcribe and save. …",18 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 One of my faves,5,"Welch's Fruit snacks appear to be a healthy, nutritious snack food for children and adults alike. They're made by Welch's, a company in the fruit juice business since 1869, and on the colorfully designed packages brimming with pictures of luscious fruit, we see that this wonderful snack is made with ""REAL FRUIT"", and no preservatives. Each 2.5 ounce package contains 100% of the daily vitamin C requirement, 25 % of vitamin A, and 25% of Vitamin E. Try to top that Snickers or Three Musketeers! I've been enjoying this delicious snack for years and never grow tired of them. My two favorite flavors might be concord grape and mixed fruit; I don't have a least favorite. In my last bag of mixed fruit I observed mostly red pieces with a few orange and only one concord grape piece. The different flavored snacks are colored and shaped differently, many with pebbly texture on top to simulate berries. They are soft and chewy, but not overly so. Their sweetness is satisfyingly pleasing but not as intense as one might experience with a piece of candy. The tastes vary with the flavors, but in the bag of mixed fruit one doesn't distinguish distinctive flavors. I've always thought of the Welch's Fruit Snacks as a guilt free treat, like eating a piece of fruit. Well, that's not quite true. The first ingredient, you'll notice, is fruit juice, not real fruit, followed by corn syrup and sugar. The fruit part, actually a fruit puree, follows the sweeteners and the modified corn starch. Also in these fruit snacks are artificial colorings like red #40, yellow #5, and blue #1. Some of these colors can trigger hyperactivity in children. Yellow 5 use to set my daughter off like caffeine. The Welch's Fruit Snacks are not sticky to the touch like some other fruit based snacks. At work I sometimes share a bag or two with students who universally enjoy them as much as I do. Overall this is a good, nutritious snack, maybe a bit heavy handed with the sweeteners. I like the ingredient list better than that of other similar snacks such as Fruit Roll-ups. For what it's worth, Fruit Roll-ups have 373 calories per 100 grams of snack. Welch's Fruit Snacks have 325 calories per 100 grams. …",20 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 Not as good...,2,I found about this sauce here [...] because I was looking for some great BBQ sauce and this product showed up. I read all of the great reviews and I was planing to add it to marinate my Christmas Turkey but after tasting it...I will not be doing that. This sauce was disappointing. It wasn't as delicious as people say it is. I'll tell you...it tastes kind of like Pico Pica salsa only Pico Pica tastes much better and is much cheaper and you can pick up a bottle of Pico Pica Hot Sauce and Mild sauce at many stores and here on Superstore. So...just to describe the taste...it tastes like a little Pico Pica and some other cheap mild Mexican hot sauce only it's not that great.

 almost too cute to eat... almost,5,"There are two types of folks in this world - those who love licorice and those who hate it. I have never met anyone who is indifferent toward licorice.

Amazing detail in these tiny Scotties - almost looks like the Monopoly playing piece in edible form.

 Full vs. Medium Roast Espresso Beans,4,"Espresso beans can be roasted in different ways. Lavazza and Illy represent the best of two different approaches to roasting beans for Italian espresso. Illy roasts their beans for a longer time, but at a lower temperature, than Lavazza. As a result of its higher roasting temperature the Lavazza is darker, and according to some people more robust, than Illy is. At its best, when properly ground, tamped, and brewed, Lavazza espresso is a bit stronger tasting and also a little bit more bitter than Illy. The Lavazza espresso also has a very pure black color once brewed and when it is done properly it has a hint of licorice in the aftertaste. Personally, though, I prefer the Illy approach which is why I am giving this coffee four rather than five stars. But, even so, I certainly recognize the high quality of Lavazza. In my opinion Lavazza represents the very best of the widely available dark (as opposed to medium like Illy) Italian Espresso roasts. …",97 out of 102 users found this review helpful
 It conditions your hair.....and you can eat it too!,4,"In my never-ending search to find odd, unusual and inexpensive beauty products I have finally found ""COCONUT OIL""!!! I read a beauty book recently You Get Hooked on Lip Balm?: Top Cosmetic Scientists Answer Your Questions about the Lotions, Potions and Other Beauty Products You Use Every Day that claimed that natural, organic, cold pressed coconut oil was the only oil that could actually penetrate the hair shaft. It seems all other oils, including mineral, olive, and sunflower can only coat the hair, at best a temporary cure. What makes coconut oil special? Its about 90% saturated fatty acid which contains about 40% lauric acid. Among it's almost mythical and magical properties it is ""reputed"" to cure a host of maladies including high cholesterol, obesity, infections,(all highly doubtful)and dry hair and skin (believable). It is also a food product that can be used as a butter substitute a shortening and a frying oil. My interest, however, is hair, just hair. Interestingly, coconut oil solidifies at temperatures under 76 degrees Fahrenheit. If you live in an air conditioned home in a temperate climate, this oil will be solid most of the time. I decanted a few teaspoons into a small container from the wide jar the product comes in. I keep the original container in the refrigerator and the small one in the bathroom where it is usually much warmer than the rest of my house. When liquefied, this oil is fairly thick and milky looking. It smells deliciously of coconut. To me it tastes of .... coconut grease....but not in a totally bad way. To use this as a hair conditioner one needs to start slowly and experiment. Although my hair is thick it has a fairly fine texture. The first few times I used the oil I over applied it and my hair became flat and greasy looking. As a hair conditioner, it is recommended to coat your dry hair and scalp with the oil, cover your head with a towel and let it penetrate for an hour or two. Using non-conditioning shampoo, apply a small amount to your dry hair and rub it in without adding any water at first. Then, after the shampoo has been rubbed in, add small amounts of warm water until you build up a lather. Rinse, then shampoo again normally. Your hair will be very soft and smooth. As a hair dressing, use only a very tiny amount unless your have thick, very curly or kinky hair. I gave a friend with long thick curly hair some of the oil and she is completely in love with it. A little of this product goes a very long way. A jar should last a very long time. Besides, if you don't like it as a hair product, you can always eat it! …",30 out of 32 users found this review helpful

 Food Should Taste Good ....,5,"... and these do!! Wow! I was really surprised at how good these chips are. These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there. The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right. They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips. Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt. Not these. An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium. For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts. Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack. Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges? These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers. Yum!!

 Gas station coffee dispenser garbage,1,"This stuff tastes like the ""coffee"" you get from those vending machines at interstate gas stations or 7-11s. The first ingredient listed on the box is group of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. Doesn't bode well for a supposed cappuccino. That's followed by multiple, seemingly random sweeteners, then instant coffee, a long list of other stuff that has no business associating itself with coffee, and then (inexplicably) sucralose, which gives it a strong artificially bitter aftertaste.

" Bold, but Not Teeth Jarring Bold. Nice Flavor and a Nice Cup of Coffee.",4,"Wolfgang Puck French Roast is a nice, bold (not too bold), flavorful cup of coffee. If you like People Extra Bold Organic, Dark Roast Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2) , then you should like Wolfgang Puck's French Roast. This French Roast has a deep flavor with a hint of sweetness and a smooth finish - a good choice for a morning cup of coffee. Recommended. (Note to Manufacturer: as a consumer, I wish you would use real coffee descriptions(i.e., hints of ****, smooth finish) rather than fluff advertising like ""Bring the aromas of France home with you and ""Profitez des bons moments"" (enjoy the good moments)!"" - what does that really mean?

" If you like to make Moroccan food, this is an essential item",4,"I have enjoyed Moroccan food for many years and have recently received a tagine pot for Christmas. As I started to build a Moroccan pantry I knew that there were a few item that were essential. This included preserved lemons, Ras el Hanout spice blend and a Harissa paste. I found this one on Superstore and even though it seemed a little pricey I ordered a couple of jars. Here is my take on it: Zamouri's Harissa Chili Paste has an obvious red pepper flavor and is medium low to medium heat (depending on your taste). Although the peppers are not identified on the label I am guessing New Mexican red and cayenne (this product is made in the US, by the way). Still, the chilies are not overwhelming and several exotic flavors come through. The first thing that I tasted was cumin although it is not specifically mentioned on the label. Here are the listed ingredients: Fresh Chili Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Salt, Preserved Lemons, Garlic, Paprika, Olive Oil, Vinegar, Water, and other spices. I have to be honest and say that I am certain that when I visit a African grocery store I will be able to find a similar blend at a fraction of the price. However, if that is not an option for you this blend is authentic and very, very flavorful.

 Can cause bad reaction!!!,1,"Bad side affects!!! It doesn't happen to everyone, but to some people this gum has bad side affects. Don't worry, nothing is permanent, and if you've already consumed it and nothing happened, you're fine. It's just for some people, their body doesn't know how to process it properly, so short side affects are included. I'm not saying Orbit is at fault, because they have other excellent gum, but this did not go so well for me. It contains and ingredient called Aspartame, which is a fake sager. To learn more, go to this website: [...] When I ate it my lips got tingly, and my throat and tongue went numb. I also felt nauseous, had difficulty breathing and got a headache. If you've previously had Mono, or have it now, it can either bring out the Epstein Barr virus,(The virus that causes Mono) or temporarily make it worse. Also, if you have a muscle disease, you can temporarily experience muscle pain. Just remember, check gum boxes for any fake sugars, and remember that this doesn't happen with everyone, it can be rare. And again I'm not blaming Orbit for this problem, as this gum tasted great, my body just didn't agree with it. If you do have the symptoms, gargle and swish with salt water, drink a whole water bottle, and you should be fine within about half and hour. I encourage you all to do research on fake sugar. …",3 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Mouth watering!,5,"Over the last 3 years I have sampled every major protein bar offering and I have to say these Power Crunch bars are my favorite. It has a very sugary, chocolate taste that is similar to real chocolate wafer cookies. Power Crunch does not have the thick, hard protein ""paste"" you'll find in most bars. The chocolate wafer style is soft and almost disintegrates in your mouth - quite a contrast from most protein bar offerings. I've eaten probably a dozen a week for the last six weeks and I still cannot get enough of these bars. In all fairness most protein bars have 30+ grams of protein - more than double the amount than the 14 grams in Power Crunch. So personally I consider Power Crunch to be a very healthy high protein candy bar rather than protein bar. But after tasting Power Crunch, it'll be a long time before I reach for another Detour, MET-Rx, Oh Yeah, South Beach, or any other bar. …",29 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 An excellent food,5,"I have been feeding Blue Buffalo foods to my Golden Retriever, who is almost 3 years old, since I brought him home as a 7 week old puppy. As a veterinary technician, I am aware of many common health problems in the breed, allergies being one of them. Knowing that corn and other fillers can be the cause of allergies, I wanted a food that only used the best ingredients. I looked into many different brands that were reported to use quality ingredients. Blue Buffalo, it turned out, was the only such brand that was readily available in my area. The breeder had been feeding Eukanuba Puppy food, so I started ""Bruce"" on a mixture of the Eukanuba Puppy and the Blue Buffalo Puppy. He would actually pick out the Eukanuba and only eat the B.B. kibbles (one of my coworkers reports that her Dachshund puppy did the same when she switched him to B.B.). So, I ultimately gave up on trying to mix the foods and just fed straight B.B. He would, sometimes, pick out those ""Lifesource Bits"" and leave them scattered all over the floor but is now a voracious eater and is not picky at all. As he is now an adult, I have been feeding him a variety of the B.B. flavors. I started him with the B.B. Large Breed formula, then switched to the Fish and Sweet Potato, then the Lamb and so on. I am hoping that by rotating the formulas, I will be able to prevent or, at least, cut down on any food allergies and provide him with a healthy variety of nutrients. Since he quickly scarfs down any food I put down for him, I can't see that he has any preference to flavor. He loves them all. I can report that, to date, ""Bruce"" has been an extremely healthy dog. His coat is thick and shiny, his eyes are clear, and he is a very solid 95 Lbs. Everyone that sees him oohs and aahs over how handsome he is. I know a lot of that is genetics but I'm sure Blue Buffalo had a little something to do with it, as well. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 WARNING -- read reviews--Canidae has changed their formula.,1,"My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet. Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea. My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks. After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet! Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill. My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula. Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae. …",20 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Good X-Bold Dark Roast for the Price,4,"Really my title sums up my opinion of this cup altogether. It does make a nice, heart large cup of dark roast coffee, and $25 for 48 cups as the preorder price was outstanding. At that price, I don't think I've ever really seen better, but at the same time the brew doesn't seem quite as bold or earthy tasting as a cup of Green Mountain Dark Magic or Emeril's Big Easy Bold. I prefer a robust large cup on almost every brew, and I've realized that even the Ice Brew K-Cups are basically the same thing; a cup of coffee with extra grounds for brewing a small amount stronger...so I brew iced coffee with my Extra Bold k-cups. I did the math on weight, and these weigh in at just under a cup of Dark Magic or Sumatran Reserve, but I'd still say my favorites (by taste,) are the brands I've listed above or Tully's Italian or French Roast, Caribou Obsidian, Starbucks Dark Sumatra, or even Barista Prima French and Italian Roasts. The only other thing I can note about these is that the construction of the pods is about perfect; I didn't find any grinds in the box leaving me to believe there were no leaking pods. Almost all the pods had a little air puffing the foil out; which I've noticed a lot of the Keurig brands have flat foils, anyways, so I'm not even sure if it matters that much, although I've had grinds brew through on some of the flat pods. The only other difference I can mention is the material of the foil top is different than Keurig brand pods; these are slightly harder and smoother (almost like a plastic or polymer,) but it doesn't seem to effect the brew process at all, and I didn't seem to get any grinds in my cup, so all in all it just doesn't matter to me. Still better than brewing through a regular coffee pot (even from fresh ground beans,) and I don't think I'll ever get tired of my Keurig coffee maker. …",16 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Great stuff!,5,"My daughter often had a Carnation Instant Breakfast (CIB) for breakfast when she was in high school, leading my wife and I to give her grief for not having a good breakfast. Years later, when my aging father was ill and it was difficult to get him to eat as doctors said he should, a nurse recommended CIB, saying that it was a complete meal. Fortunately, my father loved it. Since then at least two other nurses have mentioned it to me, and for the past several years I've been drinking it fairly regularly. Now, it's rare that a day goes by when I don't have CIB for one of my meals. A major ice storm hit the rural area I live in recently, knocking out power, telephone, and even cellular service and water. Part of a tree in our front yard landed on the power line, and limbs of two tall trees fell onto our driveway, blocking our means of exit. Fortunately we had a fresh box of CIB on hand (French Vanilla, our favorite flavor) and a gallon of milk (which we kept ""refrigerated"" by keeping it in a cooler outside where the temps were below freezing). After that experience I realized that having a supply of CIB plus some powdered milk and bottled water on hand was as important as having flashlights, a portable radio, batteries, candles, and matches, etc., in case of emergency. I'm a big guy who likes to eat and who does a fair amount of physical labor, and a glass of CIB fills me up, gives me an energy boost, and keeps me satisfied till lunchtime (assuming I've had it in the morning; sometimes I have it for lunch instead). When I travel by car to visit relatives out of state I carry a supply of CIB with me. They may offer me eggs and sausage or bacon, etc., for breakfast, but if I have my CIB and milk is available, that and a good cup of coffee are all I need. I've also gotten into the habit of carrying a thermos with a pre-mixed CIB drink in it when I go on such road trips, so that I can have that for a meal when I'm on the road instead of having a McDonald's meal. I have noticed that I stay more awake and alert throughout the 8 1/2 hour drive if I substitute a CIB for a McMeal, and don't feel a need to pull into a rest area for a nap as I usually do after eating a McMeal. I swear by it and even though Superstore's price is only a few cents below what my local WalMart charges, getting CIB delivered to the door 3 boxes at a time is convenient and seems a good way to avoid ever getting low on it. I like it blended with a banana too, and in hot weather blending CIB with a banana and a scoop of vanilla ice cream makes for an extra special treat. I have apologized to my daughter for giving her a hard time about her CIB breakfasts when she was in high school. When I tell her that at least 3 nurses have raved about CIB to me, she says, ""See? SEE? And you and mom gave me such a hard time, telling me it wasn't enough to have for breakfast! Grrrr!!"" ;-) …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Meh,3,"We got the twenty-four-piece multi-pack, which comes with four flavors: Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, Strawberry, and Sour Apple.

Also, some vitamins and minerals are added. Sour Apple ingredients are exactly the same, except there is no coloring added.

The ingredients aren't bad either, but they're nothing exciting -- as far as we can tell, they're just apple (pectin comes from apples) with anonymous color and flavor enhancers (and the supplemental vitamins and minerals). Additionally, among the Tropical Twist flavored fruit ropes were several that had not been packaged properly. The ropes were sticking out the bottoms of the wrappers, having been squished along with the wrapper when the machinery pressure/heat sealed them. The reviewers who thought these were very chewy must have gotten stale ones. The fresh ones are on the softer side, but still sticky. (Braces wearers, beware.) For small, individually-wrapped dried fruit treats, I would recommend Stretch Island fruit leather instead. These contain the fruits named in their flavors (e.g. the ingredients in Stretch Island's ""orchard cherry"" fruit leather are: apple puree concentrate, cherry puree concentrate, orange puree concentrate, natural black cherry flavor) and they taste like those fruits, too, without being too sweet or tart or sticky. …",31 out of 36 users found this review helpful

 Pretty nice,4,"The product consists of an approximately 10 inch (25 cm) long piece of meat with 1 or 2 smaller (approx 1 1/2-2 inches, 3-5 cm) pieces thrown in. The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package. Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt). It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather. I appreciate the fact that the pepper bits are not ""loose"" like some other jerkies, so crumbs are not much of a concern. Per the box, store in a cool, dry place.

 Seriously Delicious!,5,"I know that coffee reviews are subjective -- we all have different tastes and preferences, right? So I'm writing my review based on my own preferences for a light roast coffee with a ""soft"" flavor (rather than overly bitter or bold). This is currently my 100% absolutely favorite k-cup flavor. While it's brewing I get the distinct aroma of cinnamon rolls. I brew in a Keurig B40 and choose the 9.25oz serving size and think the brew strength is exactly right. My usual method of serving is to heat about 6 ounces of skim milk in the microwave for 1 minute, add about 1 tablespoon SF Torani Vanilla Syrup and froth using my Aerolatte thingie. Then I add the coffee to the milk and stir gentle. It's as good as anything I can get at Starbucks! …",26 out of 28 users found this review helpful
 love it,5,"I heard about this product, but I couldn't find it anywhere in my local store. I was glad to find it at the Superstore. It came quickly. It is so fine, I don't know wether I need to rinse it or not. Anyway, I rinsed it once, it is hard to get rid of rinsing water without loosing the grains. I cooked the Teff with millet or quinoa. It turned out very tasty with added flavor and a little gelatin texture. My kids doesn't like quinoa by itself, it has a special flavor they don't like, with teff, it covered the quinoa taste and made it taste better. If you cook millet by itself, it is too dry, with teff, it adds some gelatin texture to it. I also grind it to flour, and add it to baking. It was great. I already used up one bag. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Beware of sugar content!!,1,"This product is packed with sugar - this was not clear on Superstore - I will not be using it and as it is a foodstuff, I cannot return it, even unopened. BTW the label was damaged and not even the same as in the illustration. In common with most organic consumers, I choose organic as a healthy as well as a more ecological option. So why do so many organic food producers use so much sugar. It may be organic sugar but it is still sugar and it is not healthy. Please food producers, use something low-glycemic if you need to add a sweetener, there is no excuse now with the availability of Agave flakes, xylitol or even stevia. …",25 out of 30 users found this review helpful

NONE have compared to the quality and beauty of the bonzai from this source. The people I gave these to as gifts were blown away.

 Wilton Icing Color,4,"This food coloring works great. It's the paste kind, which really does color better, more vibrantly and wastes less than any other kind.

 Disappearing Product,5,"I would rate this product as five stars without hesitation. Nutty and full flavored, it resembles very little what consumers have come to expect of rice. It's actually much better. I would rate Superstore a zero for offering such a fine product and then failing to continue to provide it when it is still readily available from the producer. For a truly reliable source for this wonderful product, visit the Lundberg Farms website. Their products can also be found in many grocery stores around the country, not just ""health food"" stores. Update to original review: The reviewer who reported a darkening of the cooking water was not reporting a fluke. This rice is not dyed, but requires washing in cold water several times before cooking to make sure that all residue on the outside of the rice is removed. This is not actually a problem. Just something that should be done as a matter of good practice in cooking all brown rices. Dark rices give you more visible evidence of the residue, but it is inherent with the lighter colored brown rices as well. The lighter colored rices produce a kind of milky solution when first washed which clears with repeated washings. After rinsing a few times, the black rice will retain its original color and the wash water should be relatively clear. Use your hands to rub the rice together when rinsing to do a thorough job. Removing this residue helps the individual rice kernels to cook without sticking together. Another tip is to coat the washed rice after the final washing with enough olive oil to produce a light sheen on the rice before cooking it. This also helps the rice to cook without sticking together and adds the flavor of the olive oil to the rice. Choice of olive oil should complement the underlying flavor of the rice being cooked and the dish being prepared. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 You Gotta Love It!,5,"Compared to a national franchise that has a last syllable of ""buck$"" (cheap shot, I agree), this easy-to-make mix is just as rich, but perhaps not as overtly sweet. (Plus, you don't have to commute for your chocolate, you get a cool plastic container with ""chocolat chaud"" written on it, and you know the contents of what you're drinking!) Mr. Domingo Ghirardelli began his company more than a century ago, and today, Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix is made in the San Francisco Bay area (picturesque San Leandro--south of Oakland, north of Fremont). Of course, Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco is a well-known and loved attraction for native and visitor alike, where diners can watch as the giant Wonka-like mixer whips up the potion. At home, simply microwave milk or water for 3-4 minutes and add the mix, or put liquid and mix into a small pan, and stir until you've reached the desired heat. Whipped cream or marshmallows are traditional accoutrements, although drinking it straight is an experience just as beautiful. Ingredients are sweet ground chocolate and cocoa (the latter contains sugar, cocoa processed with alkali--they are very forthcoming about its manufacture--unsweetened chocolate (also process with alkali), soy lecithin--an emulsifier, and vanilla. C'est tout! Not counting the milk or water base, 3 tablespoons of chocolate mix has only 80 calories, 1.5 grams fat (0.5 g saturated), 19 g total carbohydrates (of which 1 g is dietary fiber and 17 g are sugar, not clear what happened to the other one gram), and there is even one whole gram of protein, and 2% of the recommended daily value of iron! OK, so it's not exactly a health drink. But it is relatively low fat, no or very little caffeine, and, most important of all, makes a ""bowl of soul,"" a creamy rich, closed-eyed dreamy experience of fragrance and flavor, that only reminds you of the good things and prepares you for the others. It may move you, as it does me, to rhapsodic heights. Twenty servings per can, give some to your sweetie. …",28 out of 32 users found this review helpful

" Works, but still sticks to poop. Washable!",4,"I got my 6-pack in a larger bag that was packed in a cardboard box about 2 weeks ago - no tears or rips in any of the packs. Thanks to the Superstore Subcription Service, cat litter is now delivered to my door with free shipping and I don't have to lug a 20lb bag from the store anymore. Reason for the 4 stars: Poop still sticks to the pellets and I lose a few everytime I scoop, and it does not control poop odor. But that's ok, I just use an air freshener spray. I use 1.5 bags each time since 1 pack doesn't seem to be enough. Anyway, the pellets are washable! I was curious - so I tried and the pellets weren't all that dirty anyway as I had already scooped the dirty (pop-covered) ones out. I poured the used litter into the bottom part of an old hooded litter box that had hot water and detergent in it (I use the hood for the Breeze litterbox!). I let it soak for about 20 mins whilst I washed and dried the Breeze litter box, changed the pee pad, and poured in a new bag of litter. I used an old kitchen/dish brush that has a long handle and sort of ""scrubbed"" the used pellets in the soapy water for a few minutes and then drained the water into the toilet bowl and then rinsed it out a number of times until the water was clear. Drained it as much as I could, and then left the box in the bathtub with the window open to air-dry it, and closed the tub screen so my cat wouldn't think he had an extra litter box in the bathtub! The pellets were clean and completely dry within 2-3 days. Kinda interesting that it can be washed and we're not generating more garbage to pollute the earth. Plus, for anyone wanting to save some money.... …",44 out of 47 users found this review helpful
" Shirataki Oodles Of Noodles, Tofu-Styled",5,"I expect 2006 to be a breakout year for shirataki noodles because people want to eat heathier and better by choosing foods that help them cut down on the carbs without sacrificing the taste and texture they adore. It's a delicate balance, but shirataki noodles are proving it can be done. I've already tried the Konjac brand of shirataki noodles and reviewed them for you last week. Now let me introduce you to another kind of shirataki noodles that are quite different from the Konjac brand. They're from a company called House Foods. House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are a unique combination of tofu and polysaccharide glucomannan (yam flour) to provide a genuinely authentic pasta texture that you frankly just don't get from the Konjac brand. I was extremely surprised by the House Foods brand and would definitely choose this brand over Konjac in a side-by-side comparison -- DEFINITELY! What's so different about the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles? For starters, each 4-ounce serving (2 servings per bag) has just 20 calories and a neglible 1g net carbs (3g total carbs minus 2g of dietary fiber). While that's not ZERO, it's certainly not bad, especially considering the trade-off you make in the texture of these noodles. These are perfect for every phase of livin' la vida low-carb for a nutritious and delicious pasta alternative. Also, they are sugar-free, gluten-free, cholesterol-free, dairy-free, and even have 10% calcium. What could be better? When I opened my bag of Noodle Shaped House Foods Tofu Shirataki for supper tonight, I immediately smelled the infamous fishy odor from them as I have come to expect from this product. But don't let that deter you away from enjoying the final version of this product, though, because the smell does go away quickly once you have rinsed them off and warmed them up for a few minutes either in boiling water or in the microwave. After draining the noodles in a collander, I transferred them to a bowl, sprinkled some garlic Alsosalt on them, and poured my favorite no sugar added spaghetti sauce on top. Mixing the noodles together with the sauce, I warmed it up in the microwave for about 2 minutes. Then I added some pepperoni slices and mozarella cheese on top and cooked it in the microwave for an additional minute. Mmmmmm. This looks so good! Voila! My low-carb House Foods Tofu Shirataki pasta dish was complete and it was time to eat. Since I had already tried another brand of shirataki noodles previously, I was expecting them to be similar when I put them in my mouth. But imagine my surprise when I started chewing and noticed they were soft like real pasta and weren't as ""chewy"" as the other brands. WOW! Check it out, this is AWESOME dude! Can you imagine shirataki noodles getting any better than this? My wife said they reminded her of Oodles of Noodles when she looked at them. House Foods has certainly found their niche in the shirataki noodles market and I applaud them for providing consumers with a unique choice. While the other brands of shirataki noodles certainly aren't bad products, the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are the only ones on the market today that provide the actual look and feel of real pasta without the carbs or calories! CONGRATULATIONS to them for doing such an excellent job with their products! And apparently the consumer seems to like House Foods Tofu Shirataki, too, because their Fettuccini Shaped and Noodle Shaped products are currently #1 and #2 respectively on the list of bestselling Gourmet Foods at Superstore . How about that? So go ahead, give 'em a try! All you have to lose is excess weight. Eating pasta on a ""diet"" never tasted so good, baby! We haven't heard the last of shirataki! …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful

" Buyer beware, Proctor & Gamble has ruined this food!",1,"My girlfriend and I have been rescuing, fostering, and adopting out (through a rescue group) cats and kittens for over 10 years. We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy. So we're very experienced in all aspects of cat care, and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods. The foods are more expensive, but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions! We had been using Innova Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food for several years, once we discovered that it included no by-products, corn filler, or other junk ingredients. Our cats loved the food, which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety. Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months. We heard that Proctor & Gamble, manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods, had purchased Natura Pet Products, maker of the Innova, Healthwise, and California Natural brands, among others. Proctor & Gamble has questionable pet food testing practices (search the internet for it), so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way. So we were very upset about P&G's purchase of Natura, but we stuck with the Innova Cat & Kitten food for the short run, hoping we could later find a better alternative. Well strangely enough, for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat & Kitten that we've purchased, something has changed. The food is much more ""crumbly"", i.e. there is a lot more ""food dust"" in the bags, and the kibble looks a little different. We didn't think much of this change until our cats, which had previously LOVED the Innova food, lost interest in it and really didn't want to eat it. In the dry food mix we make, we noticed that very often, the cats would eat the other part of the mix, and leave the Innova Cat & Kitten behind. Clearly there is something different about the way P&G manufactures this food, as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products. This is EXPENSIVE food, and for the money you pay, it should be TOP QUALITY. Well, it ISN'T anymore! We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls (which are usually totally empty after feeding time), and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover, unwanted. So that was it; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat & Kitten to the store we'd purchased them from, and will never buy this food again. In fact, we've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products, which include Healthwise and California Natural. We did find a good quality alternative cat food called ""Simply Nourish"", and when we tried it with our cats, they LOVED it. There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls, and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality. WARNING: For anyone currently purchasing ""Innova Cat & Kitten"", or planning to buy it in the future, we believe P&G appears to have changed the way this food is made, for the worse. We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money, and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market. AVOID this food, it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it did before P&G bought Natura Pet Products, and ruined it! …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful
