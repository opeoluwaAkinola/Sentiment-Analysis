 Horrible,1,I used to love the old Zico when it went straight from the coconut into the container. Now that it's made from concentrate it tastes weak and spoiled. This will be my last box of ever of Zico. I'll be going back to O.N.E. or Vita Coco. …,12 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Awful,1,"These things are awful. I was thinking I would be getting a soft, moist chocolate cake with creamy filling - similar to a hostess cupcake but with the ""oreo taste"" - these things are awful. The cake is stale in its consistency - this is not an old or opened package - bought em soon as they hit stores. The icing is about the same as the cookie - not creamy. The cake part is really just plain awful!! Stick to hostess cakes or plain oreos. …",10 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Ingredients,5,"After reading the review about the change of ingredients, I contacted Holistic Select to double check the information and they clearly state that there are no pork products in this food.

 Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!,5,"I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy. The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes. My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical. Obviously, my experience made me a believer! I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands. And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Gourmet powerful Salt & Vinegar chips!,5,"Kettle brand chips are very crunchy. I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum. Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy. If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand. Otherwise, you'll love these chips. The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY. I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time. I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically. Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor. The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy! …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" IF you like this, just try tasty east Soy Jerky",1,"First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And, we found out it has granulated garlic, possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to ""spices"". Here it is part of the ""vegetarian spices"" ingredient. The company does not seem very forthcoming. Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available. Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them. This tasty eats soy jerky is the best tasting and what more, no onion or garlic powder in any of their product line. They are rated 5 of 5. This primal strip does not compare. …",0 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" Good, but costs more",3,"Oregon Chai is the only concentrate my wife and I will buy, so this is not a critique of the product, but the cost of this particular package. You'd think buying the larger container, in a super concentrate (2 oz. per serving) would be lower in cost per serving. This half gallon of super concentrate costs 90¢ per serving, but the quart-sized package costs 71¢ per serving. So save your money, buy the 5-pack of quart packages. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Hands down one of the best foods on the market today,5,"I have two Basenjis both of who are under breed weight/size and who have corn allergies. I cannot stress enough how awesome this food has been for them. Their appetites are up, they are putting on weight, they have more energy where their other food (which was also on the Top Ten Dog Foods List) made them sluggish and caused one to lick a hole in herself. This food has given me my girls back and I recommend it highly to anyone who has issues with small breeds with allergies. I could go on and on about the differences but honestly, buy a bag and try it. There is nothing I can say that you won't see for yourself. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 It's a win win thing.  And I even like the smell!,5,"The skin is a great delivery system for absorbing things into your body. So what are you putting on your skin? Read the ingredients on your handcream or body lotion. Are they good for you? Don't know? Can you even pronounce them? Let's keep it simple. Virgin organic coconut oil. Snowy white, unrefined, heavenly smell - this stuff is terrific!! Solid at room temperature, smooth and buttery and melts at 76 degrees; cook/fry with it on low heat for a healthy and fragrant alternative to all those ulgy refined oils and hydrogenated trans fats (YUCK!), use as a lighter butter or shortening alternative (there's not a lot of flavor and the smell is intoxicating); use as hand cream (rub it on - only gets greasy if you really over load the area) I use it as a body lotion all over my body (my skin feels soft and smooth like it did when I was a child), hair conditioner (a light deep conditioner); anti-fungal properties (put it between your toes for goodness sake!) make-up remover - voila! ear wax? I put a tiny bit of this on a q-tip; moist toilette wipes? ssshh... try a touch of this on your t.p. - and I could go on and on... It must be organic and virgin coconut oil - anything else is something else and unexceptable. I understand that it is fine for diets, and speeds up the metabolism (its those little medium fatty acid chains). Don't take my word for it - read all about it for yourself! And yes, I feed it to my dog and cat, my cat loves it - and he won't eat anything! Actually, I don't think that he can resist the smell, I can't!

 Be Careful,2,"This food has EXTREMELY high levels of protein. Not all dogs need a high protein diet, and in fact for some it can be quite dangerous. While my dog was on Orijen, my vet discovered that he had elevated liver enzymes. Many dog food health websites advocate high protein foods, but these can be very dangerous. Dogs that don't have a lot of energy and/or have little body fat (like sighthounds) do not need this much protein, and processing it can be very bad for their livers. This is a high quality food, I love that it is made by a small company in Canada, and many people have had great success with it. But know that it is NOT for every dog! Please be careful and keep in mind that more protein is not always better if you are considering this food! …",41 out of 52 users found this review helpful
 Perfect Mayo Substitute,5,"I disagree completely with the two previous reviewers ! This tastes exactly like real mayo, and the consistency is just fine, spreads easily. It's the ""fruit spreads"" that have a rubbery consistency and cannot be spread. I solved that problem, however, by dumping the entire jar into my Cuisinart mini chopper. Just give it a whizz in there, and it comes out the consistency of apple sauce. I did that with the Apple Butter, and the Apricot spread. Delicious ! …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Covers some points not considered in other reviews worth mentioning,4,"I agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a very fine product. It comes well-packaged and the instructions and assembly are easy to follow. The unit itself takes up very little space and gives off a lot of light for 15-17 hours. If you have a dark spot in the house you want to light up, one of these AeroGarden's can really improve the aesthetics. However, it's too bright to place in a bedroom in my opinion unless you good to bed late! I like the idea of growing vegetables in the house and I think they look good in a kitchen. However, when you consider the cost of the unit, replacement bulbs, seed packs and operating expenses, it isn't necessarily economical compared to say organically grown lettuce. For herbs, I think it's great because you can freeze them and there is nothing quite like fresh herbs for cooking purposes. I bought my unit primarily for aesthetic reasons and it is quite well designed and attractive. I'm looking forward to my first crop and my pump is quiet as could be. If the pump is noisy or becomes noisy, I highly recommend contacting customer service. My understanding is that AeroGarden service is top notch! …",40 out of 41 users found this review helpful
 Don't get conned into buying this food!,1,"I spent many hours on the internet studying and reviewing dog foods before I decided to start using this ""premium"" brand. They had this video of their state of the art facility where everything was hospital clean and everyone wore gloves and masks. Now I just found out via a salmonella recall notice that Wellness doesn't even make their own dog food! They outsource it to Diamond foods where several other brands are also produced in the same facility! It's the same food in a different fancy looking bag. I have just switched to a new company called ""Life's Abundance"".

 Classic Wine Gums,5,"Gustaf's come in all the classic wine gum shapes and flavors.

 Buyer Beware--I got screwed,1,"Why can't I give this a negative amount of stars??? I love these cookies and have bought them from Superstore before. The expiration date was always just a few months away--but I love them and had no problem eating all six packages in a short time. This time, I got my shipment May 2009 and the cookies all had a ""best used by March 09"" date on them. So....Superstore has now sunk to shipping goods past their expiration date. I haven't eaten any of them yet---I kind of turned off by the idea they are two month beyond the date they should be taken off the shelf. I will never buy these from Superstore again unless Superstore can assure me the product will be fresh. …",5 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Poor Packaging,3,"Like several other reviews, the honey was received with its cap off and hanging by the paper seal, and the jar empty. It is not the fault of Superstore who has indicated they will give me a refund but Wedderspoon itself. There is no inner seal on the jar, and the outer closure is not firm, and easy to pull off.

 Comparing Kraft's 'Deluxe' mac & cheese dinners,5,"Superstore sells four Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe dinners. They're all pretty good. Each uses packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder, so the cheese is never clumpy and distributes itself evenly. My husband, teenage daughter and I cooked up all four and did our own taste test. Here's what we found: The Original Cheddar flavor (Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)) is good. Plenty creamy, it tastes like a homemade version of the Kraft standard (i.e., Macaroni & Cheese Scooby Doo Shapes, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24) ). The Sharp Cheddar flavor ( Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, Sharp Cheddar, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) ) is slightly tastier, and has a subtle smoky aftertaste. The light meal (Kraft Deluxe Macaroni & Cheese Dinner - Light, 14 oz) is pretty good, ut when you try it side by side with the original flavor you can tell it's not as rich. Still, if you only buy this one you'll be happy. If you're counting calories go for it. But it's this one, the Four Cheese meal, that's the best. With the most cheese flavor, it combines American, cheddar, colby and parmesan, and tastes similar to what you'd find at a decent restaurant. The parmesan flavor is especially noticeable. These Deluxe dinners cost about twice as much as the basic Kraft boxes, but in each case you can really taste the difference. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Super Toy,4,"I really like this toy for my yellow lab puppy. He really enjoys corners, and if he can find one, he will demolish it. Regularly shaped Nylabones last around a month. This ring has been super fun! He likes to play with it a lot because it's round, so he can stick his paw in to secure it, and then chew. It's very sturdy, but there is another version of it called the ""Gumabone"" for younger pups. I wouldn't go over 5mos with Gumabone products. This toy is really fun for dogs, almost indestructable, it's super! …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 from concentrate! tastes horrible! yuck!,1,"I recently purchased one of these from my local supermarket. I thought the flavor of the box version of zico was ok so I figured they just redesigned their package...Boy was I wrong! I took a sip and as fast as the liquid entered my mouth, it also left the other way! Yuck! It tastes like really sugary old coconuts. I then looked at the ingredients and see ""premium coconut water from concentrate, natural flavors."" I just don't get it: Why would they go from using fresh coconut water in their box version to concentrated coconut water in this not very environmental friendly plastic bottle--and charge more for it!? Am I missing something? The taste is horrible and I really wish they would go back to their original formulation. There are enough pure coconut water products like vita coco, one, on the market, so why settle for something from concentrate, pay more for it, and hurt the planet with more plastic? …",31 out of 41 users found this review helpful
 For one thing and one thing only!,5,"In the Carolinas, people have all sorts of ideas about how to cook up and serve bar-b-que...mostly bad. If you like vinegar soaked cat food, come to North Carolina and we'll hook you up. However, this runny red mildly-hot vinegar-based concoction by Scott's makes about the best marinade for ribs you'll find anywhere, that is if you don't have a bottle of Chiavetta's laying around somewhere.

" Good product, but...",4,"I've yet to find any of the dogs I know that love it. I still have my allergic dog eating it, but she has to be hungry to eat this without doctoring. My vet doesn't want me feeding her people food so I add some of Newman's or Happy Hips canned to it. I've talked to a couple of vets about prescription diet and they all push the big company brand names. The common objection appears to be the soy used in Newman's to increase the protein count. I am willing to put a little flavor in this to feed may dog high quality, social responsible food. I may be the only person who has made the following mistake but, assuming you catch the Superstore sales, make sure you are ordering the bag size you want.

 The Most Delicious Granola You'll Ever Have,5,"Absolutely! It is by far the nicest tasting granola I have ever had. It is not the same texture as most granola. It isn't extremely hard and crunchy. It is a bit softer in texture, but this doesn't mean that it sops up milk like a sponge if you choose to eat it more like a cereal. It remains the same lovely texture, not too hard, and definitely not mushy. As for its flavour, it's a bit nutty tasting. The cranberries in it are a splendid bit of tart-sweetness, and the sunflower seeds are gorgeous as well. I generally mix a bit of Bear Naked Peak Protein All Natural Granola in with my Crispix. It's a scrummy touch to the Crispix, and makes the 12 ounce bag of Bear Naked Peak Protein All Natural Granola last a lot longer. (I tend to have this for breakfast and at least one snack a day.) I give Bear Naked Peak Protein All Natural Granola five stars for its taste, texture, and nutrition. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Some Patience Needed,3,"With the other reviews I wasn't really expecting much, but I was buying different seeds from the same store and was looking for a way to justify the shipping costs by buying more than one item. The item looked like an interesting experiment and if it turned out well I had a small tree, if I didn't I was out less then $1. Followed the instructions and pretty much saturated the soil when I first planted it, so much I was afraid I'd killed it right off but after that rocky start I set it in the sun and let the soil dry out. I didn't wait until the soil was too dried out before giving it a little more water, about two weeks later I ended with a seedling that I had to take out of direct sunlight immediately because I nearly did burn the leaves. All in all it's hard to say much until it starts growing a little more and I don't want to count it until it does. Small note, learned they're very sensitive to too much water and too little water as well as climate, they also take a little time to grow. Could be the season that let this one sprout or just luck but I'm willing to be happy with either, if nothing else it is a plant. I'll try to keep this updated as it grows but the basic response is if you got time and a little money this is worth a shot but if you are absolutely counting on any seedlings I'd try something will grow a little easier. …",38 out of 38 users found this review helpful
 Reconciliation complete,1,"The bars arrived from 'Indian Foods' in Houston today. They are all melted and hardened into lumps! I know its hot in Houston in the summer but to send out a product like this does not do Superstore's reputation any good at all. I DO NOT recommend buying this product from Superstore if the supplier cannot supply a decent product. I will attempt to be reimbursed by Superstore for this product. Went back to Superstore who referred me to the seller. Money refunded with good will and personal recommendation to not buy during hot weather.

 Good with some modifications,3,"I was sick of eggs. And sick of cornflakes. So when I spotted the Pancake mix from Bob's, I had to try it. Like all of their products, it was really easy to make - just like any pancake mix. The first batch I made, however, were... well, let's say ""Dense."" I was feeding a guest, who clutched his throat and asked for liquid to wash it down. But I didn't think they were THAT bad, considering the wheat free sludge I'd engaged before. So, I drowned mine in maple syrup and thought it was quite tasty. The next time, I tried modifying the recipe a bit with fruit - fresh blueberries to be exact. And those came out a lot moister and less dense. Mmm... blueberry pancakes... wonderful! I've tried other fruit, tossed in applesauce once... and each time, I got interesting twists on much moister pancakes. I still don't eat them often -- just when I'm having a ""help, I can't eat another egg"" moment. Actually, they are good as part of a big brunch, with an egg over easy on top. Since can't eat bread with my eggs, it takes the place of toast. I've wondered if whipping these frothy with a beater might help but haven't tried it yet. All in all, they're tasty, if a little thick, very filling and easy to whip up. …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 The best your money can buy!,5,"This tea by Rishi is the most exquisite tasting Jasmine Pearl Green Tea I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. I know the price may be a little more than what you are used to paying for green tea, but, believe me, it is definitely worth it. The jasmine flavor is rich and sweet, all by itself. The amount of work that goes into creating each of these lovely pearls is astounding (hence the price!). Once you have tried this tea, all other jasmine green teas will pale in comparison. The flavor is so concentrated, you only need to use a scant teaspoon of pearls for each cup of tea that you brew, so these two cannisters will last for some time.

 Too harsh for normal use,3,"The three star rating is for the ""full spectrum"" bulbs only. We've purchased about 30 Earthmate bulbs of various sizes now. We're mostly happy, but the 6 ""Full spectrum"" bulbs we bought give out a harsh white light that is hard to live with. We've managed to find places where we won't use them often. The other ""soft white"" bulbs we bought work just fine. The 30-watt bulbs are especially bright and nice, but can actually put out too much light in a multibulb fixture and so might need to be mixed with 13 or 23 watt bulbs in that setting. One other issue is that several of the Earthmate bulbs we received were broken and two were DOA but not broken. The broken ones were clearly a case of poor packaging by Superstore (bulbs against the side of the box with no packing filler). Superstore is great about refunding the appropriate amount so I have no worries about ordering Earthmate bulbs again. …",5 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 #1 superfood,5,"Nutritional benefits of Chia seeds are amazing. Here are a few to start: *According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids. *The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein. *Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy. *Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health. *Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk. *Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana. *Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia, it also tastes very good. My girlfriend and I make a big pot of ""steel cut"" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of chia powder, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it. Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions. There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite. I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days. One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven't put in 500 miles. But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon! Could the Chia have helped?

 Unacceptable ingredients,1,"I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason: Kelloggs continues to include GMO (genetically modified organism) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels. There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption. Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers. However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly. It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy. Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers. …",14 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Wellness Cat Food,5,"Since cats are obligate carnivores, high protein and very low carbs are a must for keeping your companion animals happy & healthy.

 Tasty but with a big drawback,2,"Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot. Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!! Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Superstore product description. Ouch! So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter. Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten. That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past. However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is ""imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources. We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west."" All that said, taste is pretty good and the ""wet"" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer). …",10 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Greenies are not digestible -your puppy will vomit and have diarrhea and will get very sick,1,"I made the mistake to give a Greeny to my puppy without reading reviews about this product. It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea. I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"". I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days. After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie! At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies. In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog. …",9 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 BPA no longer an issue,4,"****Latest Update**** We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free. I confirmed this with customer service. Leaving the remaining review as it was... ********************* My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased. Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read the review about BPA in the lids. I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product? As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly. ***UPDATED (old)**** Just spoke to someone from customer service. She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food. I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it. I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least. …",86 out of 89 users found this review helpful

 Not nutritionally sound,1,"I had been using this food mixed with the canned science diet for my lab puppy (because that is what the shelter had used), and didn't have any issues. However, after reading the other review, I asked the manager at a local pet food store what he thought of this brand, and he said it was NOT good - all fillers (corn) and animal by-products. He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content. (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc). He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist. (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.) Finally, he also said that bully sticks are far better for dogs than rawhide (which are basically like eating leather). …",6 out of 13 users found this review helpful

" Fine Tea Experience, With Caveats",4,"**** This Cranberry Weightless tea is lovely, and has a marvelous taste. It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health. It probably does contribute to ""Weightless"" (weighing less) but only by ridding your body of excess water; still, if it can do this in a healthy way, I'm all for it. I like drinking it as a calming ritual before meals, which for me has some value, too. It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it. The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf. Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice. Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge. The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: ""For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract. Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming."" So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly. Also note the following cautions: ""Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs."" **** …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Be careful with wheat gluten,1,"I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used. The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs. When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract. This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines. This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating. Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off. The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal. So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat. It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains. Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies. …",24 out of 47 users found this review helpful

 Love it!,5,"I have a 8.5 month old Aussie mix. She's about 42 lbs now. This food is magic!! I love it! She's never been ""food motivated"" and so she's always been a little reluctant to eat her kibble, but she honestly LIKES this stuff. She'll do tricks for it like it is a treat. More importantly, her poop is GREAT on this kibble. Finally, it's easy to pick up! This food is a godsend. We've previously tried Innova EVO, California Natural Lamb and Rice Puppy and Adult, and Canidae All Life Stages. Innova EVO gave her the runs, but she was a new puppy. (The pet food store said EVO was rich enough for puppies. My vet disagreed.) California Natural seemed better, but her poop was always so soft that it was messy to pick up, and she never really liked it. She liked the taste of Canidae better - so much so that she would pick it out when I mixed it with the Lamb and Rice. However, her poop didn't really improve until we shifted to Orijen. Magic. This stuff is magic, I say. Besides being the magic food for my dog, it's also made in Canada with almost all Canadian ingredients. From what I've read, they get rice from California and Lamb from New Zealand, but otherwise -- everything comes from farms in and around Alberta. No food recalls on this brand!

 DELICIOUS MIXED NUTS & WHITE CHOCOLATE BAR!!!,5,"Okay so I ordered every flavor of these during the summer sale in June were most of the flavors $12, and if you signed up ""Subscribe and Save"" they were $10.50 each. So, I will be putting up reviews as I open each box. They have been in the fridge (keeps me from random snacking) and I opened Dark Chocolate, Chocolate Mudslide, and Mixed Nuts & White Chocolate last night. I am 5'3"" and 118 and I try to add some protein to my diet with bars like this. My review will only be for the Mixed Nuts & White Chocolate (others on the appropriate product pages.) I will start with what EVERYONE really cares about: TASTE! These bar tasted incredible to me!!!! Nutty, sweet, light, creamy white chocolate, chewy consistency, NO chemical taste, sweet but not too sweet. I read the nutrient profile and the ingredient list, and I am really pleased with the ingredient quality. This is what attracted me to the product. It is very low sugar, gluten free, and wheat free. This is great for those watching their waistline. On the other hand, it has a pretty sizeable fat content. This one has 12(!!!) grams of fat. So just be aware of that when including in your diet, too many of these and you WILL gain weight! The protein is okay (10 grams), as much as 1.5 oz of grilled chicken. (Although chicken breast doesn't have this much fat, and that's not enough chicken to fill anyone up.) The sodium isn't bad (110 mg). There are 8 net carbs, which subtract out the fiber and sugar alcohols (the sugar alcohols are in debate as to whether your body burns them as calories or not.) The calories, fat, protein, and carbs are equal to: a large plain green salad, 1.5 oz chicken breast, 2 cups broccoli, almost a full tablespoon of oil. So I say that to illustrate that this is definitely a healthy MEAL REPLACEMENT for those on the go (if you add veggies and soup) and really has TOO MANY calories for a full bar to be a snack. It also doesn't have enough heaviness/volume in your stomach to make you feel full for four hours until your next meal. It is kind a lightweight bar compared to thinkTHIN's regular 20gram protein bars (Read my review for Dark Chocolate and Chocolate Mudslide, those have a preferable nutrient profile for a meal replacement.) I don't really think any bar that has more fat than protein is helpful, people will still be hungry and gain weight. They do not really have enough protein to eat as a meal replacement because you will be hungry in less than four hours after eating. If you do use as a meal replacement, add a broth soup and a large green salad with low-cal dressing, or veggies (most grocery stores sell washed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots that you can eat on the go.) Another way to incorporate these DELICIOUS bars into your routine is a breakfast. Perfect for on the go and it's hard to eat more before lunch even if you do get hungry (which most people don't get very hungry before lunch.) So in summary: EXCELLENT ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS; DELICIOUS, SWEET NUTTY FLAVOR WITH CREAMY WHITE CHOCOLATE (as good as a candy bar); CONVENIENT PACKAGING; WEAK VITAMIN & MINERAL PROFILE (you'll still need a comprehensive multivitamin daily); CONVENIENT SOURCE OF PROTEIN; GREAT SNACK (if you eat half as a snack or the other half later in the day as a snack.) THE PRICE IS RIGHT too based on Superstore's deal vs. in store pricing on these bars. They are very expensive in retail stores, Superstore is selling them almost 50% off. Helpful hint: if you sign up for Subscribe & Save, you get the best price. You can set your shipments to every six months, and even if you don't want them then, you can delay shipment. The point is, you really never have to buy more later in order to get the best price now. You can keep deferring shipment. Not saying that to scam Superstore, just saying that may help more people be willing to try a delicious bar if the price is right. I hope this review helped you make a purchasing decision, either for or against the product. I know I hate to waste my money, and I wanted to give a honest review. …",17 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Beautiful little olive bonsai,5,"June 28, 2006: Lovely bonsai, extremely well packaged - arrived in perfect condition (beware the oodles of styrofoam pieces left after unpacking! :-)) My olive tree was actually blooming when it arrived last week, and has a nice, delicate fragrance. Pot doesn't come with a saucer, so be sure to put a dish underneath before watering. More compact that the tree pictured (but more typically bonsai shaped), I am quite happy with my purchase. I still prefer to grow, shape and pot my own bonsai, but this little olive (which I can't find in my area other than ordering here) was a nice addition to my bonsai collection. Recommended! Update 1-23-07: Little black olive bonsai still looks fantastic. It has had no health problems, and has bloomed several times since purchased(small, pale green flowers, followed by tiny ornamental fruit that falls off shortly thereafter, like an ornamental crabapple). Needs watering every two-three days in summer, every three-four days in winter. Mine sits in a floor-to-ceiling window in a highrise building receiving full sunlight most of the day, and constant air from an air vent above the window. Hasn't grown much (I experienced one burst of new leaves, which promptly died when I left on vacation and it went without water for almost a week). So, I haven't needed to trim it yet.

 Made in China! My dog got very sick...,1,"Please be aware that although dogs absolutely LOVE these treats, that they may have caused a recent unexplainable illness in our 9 month old Mastiff pup. He was getting 1 or 2 a day of these chicken jerky's for about a week and then suddenly became very lethargic, along with vomiting, diarrhea, and had no appetite ""except"" he would eat only these treats and drink water. Vet thinks he'll recover OK, but advised us to stop feeding them to our dogs. These are still ""Made in China"" and in 2007 reports had shown that dogs were getting sick from these and other brands, and there are still reported cases today. Just be careful and watch your pets closely if you are feeding them these. We will no longer feed these to any of our dogs, ever.

 Feel the FIVE-HOUR POWER!,4,"I'm not a ""morning person"". I tolerate the pre-noon hours in much the same way Superman would endure a kryptonite G-string -- with lots of fidgeting and sweating and complaining about the enormous pain in the **** it's causing. But some days, I have to ""rise and whine"", whether I like it or not. For those mornings, I need a boost to get up and at 'em. Or up and near 'em. Up and not drooling on 'em, at least. I'll take what I can get. I've always heard good things about these 5-hour energy pills, and extra-strength is _always_ better, so I bought some to help shake the cobwebs after waking up early. I popped the cap on one, slugged it down, and... OHMYGOD I CAN TOTALLY FEEL THE BLOOD IN MY FINGERS, ONLY IS IT ME FEELING THE BLOOD OR THE BLOOD FEELING ME?

 Stabilizes overnight blood sugar,5,"My 9-year-old daughter has Type 1 diabetes and we could not find a bedtime snack that stabilized her overnight blood sugar - until her diabetes educator recommended the Extend Bar. It REALLY does what it claims to do - stops blood sugar from going too low overnight. Now my daughter does not have to eat a glucose tablet in the middle of the night to keep from going too low. Her morning headaches and shakiness are gone! If her bedtime blood sugar is 120, her fasting blood sugar is usually around 100. The bars do not cause a sharp spike in blood sugar, just as advertized. Although they don't taste like real granola bars (not as sweet or moist), all the peanut and chocolate varieties are tasty enough to satisfy a picky 9-year-old. Thank you, Extend Bar! UPDATE 12/2/2010: We tried all varieties of Extend Bar except the Mixed Berry. The ""Delight"" varieties work the best at stabilizing the blood sugar of a Type 1 diabetic, since they contain only 20-21 carbs, no sugar, and 4-6 grams of sugar alcohol: Chocolate Delight Chocolate Peanut Delight Peanut Delight The ""Crunch"" varieties contain 30 carbs, 10 grams sugar (!), and 5 grams of sugar alcohol - and they caused my diabetic daughter's blood sugar to spike overnight. I don't understand why the manufacturer included so much sugar! These are not a good choice for a Type 1 diabetic, although they might work for a mild Type II diabetic who still manufactures insulin: Chocolate Crunch Peanut Butter Crunch No one liked the taste of the Apple Cinnamon variety. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 great coffee with no environmental impact,5,"I love my keurig coffee maker, don't get me wrong, but I don't love adding all those little plastic cups to the land fill. The Solofill allows me to end the conflict between convenience and my concern for the environment. I can use any coffee I like, or as I frequently do, I can use a pod. One of the things about the Keurig I love is the ability to choose daily between varieties of coffee. Buying a pound of one kind of coffee is boring to me. So I buy locally 1/4 bags and store them in a vented airproof (airscape) container. And I buy pods (frequently on sale so the price is the same as ground beans per cup) and dump the grounds into the Solofill. I use 10 gram pods, more is too much, less is not enough. With pods, the coffee remains fresh because it's nitrogen packed. I don't have to drink all the same kind at once to use it up =) So i balance between my locally purchased fresh ground and the pods. The Solofill brews a much better cup than the K cups provide. Much richer mouth feel, and slightly stronger than an extra bold k cup. I drink mostly dark roasts (k cups: dark magic, double black diamond) and I'm very satisfied with the cups from a Solofill with 10 grams ground coffee, either from a pod or fresh. The device self-tamps when you close it so the water flows evenly throughout the grounds. No dry spots. I pop the Keurig open after I brew and come back to dump the grounds after I drink; that gives the solofill time to cool off. The only caveat is to make sure you flick off any grounds on the rim before you close the solofill so it makes a solid seal. I bought two so I can always have one ready to go...... …",257 out of 274 users found this review helpful
 Weird and Amazing!,5,"I purchased this product because my muscles were very tight. It does a great job relaxing my muscles. The strange thing is, I can't take very much or I have the wildest dreams imaginable. It also makes me tired if I take even so much as a level teaspoon each day. I started taking much less so that I wouldn't have those hyper-realistic dreams. I take 1/8 teaspoon twice a day. Here's the amazing thing. I get these spells of ""skipped"" heartbeats -- PVCs and PACs. A mere 1/8 teaspoon of this stuff nips it in the bud in minutes! I quit taking the betablockers I have on standby for this problem because this product is so effective. This morning, my husband accidentally made me 16 oz. of caffeinated coffee. Since I have significant issues with anxiety, I *never* drink caffeine. I gulped it down and started feeling incredibly jittery and anxious. When I realized what had happened (and that I wasn't merely going crazy), I took 1/8 teaspoon of Natural Calm. While I still felt hyper-alert, the jitteriness went away entirely. LOVE this stuff, and am so thankful that it is available! …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Veterinary approved...,5,"As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets. I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling. Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those ""duh"" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent. Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least. My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of ""treat."" It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it ""makes pills a treat to give!"" The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger ""capsule"" dog Pill Pockets. The cons: One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!

 What a mistake!,1,"After trying the Caledonian Kitchen Irish Whiskey Cake, I found it dull and a disappointment to a palate that has been gifted with some of Britons finest Cakes. It is not moist as it should be. It has only a slight hint of Whiskey certainly not obtained from the top shelf. It became pasty as I permitted it to blend in my mouth. The pecans are ground so fine they are lost in the breading and produce only a hint of flavour. If one was to remove the Irish Whiskey from this product you would have a basic run of the mill raisin nut cake that is best eaten with a tall glass of milk to assist in washing it down. In my years I have had numerous authentic Irish Whiskey Cakes including living 3 years in the midlands of England. Tasting a good Irish whiskey cake will initially produce a moist nutty texture on the tongue followed by a moderate but not over powering bath of Irish Whiskey to the palate. It blends with the saliva and becomes similar to a bread pudding texture almost immediately complimented by the raisins. As one swallows, the aroma of the Whiskey remains in the mouth and can be sensed in the nose. It should be moderately sweet, the Whiskey delicate, and the nuts and raisins a compliment to the texture. Even at the low price I would not purchase this product again as it insults the refined integrity of a traditional Irish Whiskey Cake. Most Irish Whiskey cakes will cost you in the neighborhood of $15-20 per pound. I would regard this product to a good Irish Whiskey cake the same as Meatloaf to a Prime Rib. …",13 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Very good and so healthy!,4,"I have really been into Yogi tea and trying them all! I have all the green teas and after a month of testing them I conclude that Rejuvenation tastes the best. It has a natural peach and lemon flavor that is very natural and mild. Most say the Simply Green tastes the best but to me it was far too boring. I got used to all the special herbs and natural flavors and the Simply Green had none added. I do not like the artificial flavors at all, nor do I like the artificial sweet taste added by too much stevia leaf. Kombucha tea is my second favorite Yogi green tea. The flavors added are natural passion fruit and plum, but I prefer the lemon flavor in my green tea. The flavors are mild and pleasant however and this tea has the added health benefits of Kombucha but so does the Rejuvenation tea, which has this same ingredient in it. Slim Life tea is very good- Amazingly good compared to diet green tea pills! I do not ever feel the side effects of a diet pill with this tea and I drink a lot of it being I got 6 boxes from Superstore. I think it's a wonderful tea but I'd prefer it if the natural blueberry flavor was left out. It does taste natural and sweet but mixed with Green tea, I'd prefer the lemon or peach flavors myself. If you do love the flavor of berry in your tea, you will love this one and it is mild and pleasant to drink all day long. The Super Anti-Oxidant variety of tea tastes good except for the licorice. The licorice is okay in the bedtime and calming teas, but does not taste right in green tea. Other then the licorice it does have a very good lemon flavor that is soothing and mild. The Slim Life tea is also very good but it does have a blueberry flavor in it, but it is worlds better then the Fasting tea, which tastes the worst of all the Yogi teas. I just love the Yogi tea positive messages don't you? At first I just bought these teas for the messages then I learned to love the tea as well! Rejuvenation is my favorite green tea and Peach Detox and Redbush Chai are my favorite flavored teas and make exceptionally good iced tea as well! The flavors, however, are very close and it took me quite a while to figure out which green tea I preferred the best. This one is good if you like licorice in your green tea that is.

" Smells good, but tastes like coffee-flavored water",3,"These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces. It didn't help. I compared them to Senseo medium roast pods. The Senseo pods make a cup of coffee that is stronger but doesn't taste as good. I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee. I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides. As long as I'm having bad coffee, it might as well be organic and fair trade and all. So they are somewhat useful to me, hence three stars. Coffee maker: Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer Update: I stayed in a hotel with a small, cone-type coffee maker (not a Pod system).

 One of the Greatest Gluten Free Products I've Found,5,"This is one of the most versatile mixes I've found, and most recipes come out tasting very much like the Full of Gluten Blends. I, like many, am struggling with celiac's disease, and I've only just found out I have it, so I'm not quite sure what to buy, what's healthy, and what doesn't taste like cardboard. Gluten Free is a way of life you have to adjust to in almost every way, from giving up many favorites, to training your pallet to love these new found grains. Bisquick is Rice based, and is very much like it's original version, however be aware that the pancakes will be a little less fluffy and that you should follow the recipe to the T when it comes to these. Betty Crocker has a Recipe website they've published for you using this product that has quite a few tasty treats you'll love. When it calls for Vegetable Shortening, be sure to use it, for example, biscuits made without shortening, and only butter will be very dry and not very satisfying, even difficult to swallow. Use recipes that include shortening, and will result in moist, fluffy foods and breads will help you end up with an enjoyable addition to your meal. Fun and Tasty Gluten Free Recipes for this mix can be found on the Betty Crocker website, they won't allow me to post the link here, sorry. UPDATE: ** Fun Tip about this and other Gluten Free Mixes, My mom Figured out that when you're mixing together your ingredients and you're using one that calls for milk, that if you mix together ONLY the BASE MIX and the MILK and let it set for about 15 minutes before continuing with your recipe and adding other ingredients, the end result is much fluffier and tastier ** This would be much like making tapioca pudding, you have to let the milk and tapioca soak to 'activate the tapioca' before moving on, so I think that type of reaction is what's happening here with the Bisquick Mix.

 Natures' One Deleted My Post from their Facebook page.,1,"Nature's One deleted my post from their Facebook page so I am posting my doctors recommendations here. If there is any question whether this company is hiding something it was quickly answered after they deleted my post in which I described recommendations that I received from the toxicologists at Environmental Health Sciences at Children's Hospital in Boston, MA. This department specifically deals with public health issues regarding environmental toxins so I believe their opinions are less biased than that of Natures One or their ""independent researchers."" Anyway, I have been feeding my baby this formula since she was born 5 months ago. I was concerned after hearing the news report regarding the levels of inorganic arsenic in the brown rice syrup so I called my local pediatrician who recommended that I call Children's Hospital. The toxicologist recommended that I stop using any formula that contains brown rice syrup as its principal ingredient along with any other baby food products with it until they have more information. He mentioned the Dartmouth study stating the brown rice syrup has well over the recommended amount of inorganic arsenic, about 6x times past the limit. It was a relief to hear from the toxicologist that I need not worry about any acute or chronic arsenic toxicity for my baby, and that she does not require any urine, blood or hair tests. This is in contrast to what many other pediatricians have recommended for their parents who are feeding their children the same formula. The toxicologist believes that my daughter's risks to developing any illness, cancer etc was less than 1% greater than a child who had not been given the formula, so that was very reassuring. After hearing these recommendations from Children's Hospital I could see how someone would still continue using the Natures One product because the health risks are low, however I opted to switch because I realize my role as a parent is to reduce any risks to my child, even if it is less than 1%. There are so many other chemical risks out there that I feel any risks that you can take off the table would help protect my child because it is probably the cumulative effect off all these chemicals that leads to adverse problems. And i figure if those people who have a Masters in Public Health are recommending to discontinue it who am I to disagree with them. An ethical company would have taken the Dartmouth study information and told the public that they will try to improve on their product, ie. reduce the inorganic arsenic, however, they still claim they make the finest baby formula out there. Their website says they are looking out for the health of our children but refuse to recall or change their product which speaks for itself. In light of them deleting my post above from their Facebook page, it appears that they definitely have something to hide, as I was just posting public health information that I felt people in my situation would like to know given to me by one of the most reputable health institutions (Children's Hospital) in the world. Obviously, I would give this product zero stars if I could. Hope this info helps some of those confused, concerned parents out there like me. UPDATE #1*** please read the article from the Huffington Post written Dr. Gary Ginsberg, a toxicologist from Yale. It is in line with the recommendations from Children's Hospital of Boston. UPDATE #2*** I received a response from Dr. Gary Ginsburg in response to the new testing results by Nature's One. Looks like their testing results indicate an even worse situation than originally thought. Here is the response from Dr. Ginsburg: ""Seeing your comment made me hopeful that this is just lab error, a false alarm. However, saying that Dartmouth doesn't know how to measure arsenic is like saying Roger Federer doesn't know how to play tennis. The Nature's One press release sounded scientific - they explain how the Dartmouth analysis was different from their method and why theirs was better. But when you click on their own results - in 3 samples of their baby formula, the inorganic arsenic is actually greater (53 to 83 ppb) than the Dartmouth results (10-20 ppb)!! So calling the Dartmouth results too high and flawed is an insult to Dartmouth as well as to all of us. Further, they compare their results to an outmoded WHO (CODEX) arsenic acceptable intake of 2.1 ug/kg/d. This was withdrawn in the latest CODEX because it was too close to the cancer effect level and CODEX did not supply a new value. Nature One claims that Dartmouth relied on the 2.1 ug/kg/d value but in fact Dartmouth used 0.3 ug/kg/d (the dose corresponding to USEPA's drinking water std) to compare against. If Nat1 used that target, their baby formula would be in the danger zone, so they chose the withdrawn target instead. The bottom line is that the company's own data make the situation worse, with levels of arsenic in their baby formula 5 to 8 times greater than the USEPA drinking water standard for inorganic arsenic (10 ppb)."" …",94 out of 106 users found this review helpful

" A Tasty Tea, and More",5,"My first-time pregnant wife saw this tea and thought that it couldn't hurt, even if she doubted the efficacy of its claims. She offered me a sip of the tea, and I must say that I liked the combination of mint, fruit, lemon, and spicy flavors. I bought some more tea, and together my wife and I would each enjoy a cup in the evening while sitting out on our back porch and watching the sun set. About a month after drinking this delicious tea, I woke up one morning feeling very queasy. When I told my wife why I looked green in the face, she smiled at me with great compassion and love. ""You're having sympathy symptoms."" I looked at her blankly. She continued, ""It's called Couvade syndrome, from the French `couver', meaning `to hatch'. It's when men feel and experience the physical symptoms associated with pregnancy."" ""Oh,"" I said, ""I wonder how far it goes."" My wife looked at me with loving eyes, laughed, and gave me a hug. ""I love you,"" she said. A few weeks later I found out just how far Couvade syndrome can go when I gained twenty pounds; began suffering backaches, stomachaches, cramping, and mild incontinence; and started craving some foods while finding others nauseating. My wife found my symptoms amusing and endearing, and in that spirit I took a home-pregnancy test, for fun. When the results came back positive, I became concerned. My wife thought I was playing a joke on her, but when then next two tests also came out positive, she also became worried. On our next visit to her OB/GYN, we asked her doctor about my positive results. She looked at me with some concern and told us that elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG--the hormone tested for in at-home pregnancy tests) levels in men are sometimes indicative of testicular cancer. I think I fainted, because I next remember waking up on an exam bed. The doctor recommended an oncologist to me and I set up an appointment right away. The oncologist explained how hCG may be produced by germ cell tumors and had some of my blood drawn for tests. That night was the most terrifying of my life as I waited for the lab results. When I saw the doctor the next day, she gave me the happiest news of my life: besides the hCG, all the other tests were negative for the most common testicular cancers. She still wanted a biopsy to be safe, and I consented, even though the idea of extracting it was not pleasing, to say the least. The biopsy results also came back clean, but the oncologist recommended that I come back in a month to monitor any changes. In the meantime, my wife and I went back to her OB/GYN for an ultrasound, and just for fun, I asked if I could have one too. The doctor humored me and scanned my lower abdomen. When she saw the screen, however, she nearly dropped the probe. ""What is it?"" I asked. ""It looks like you have a uterus,"" she said, ""with a fetus inside of it."" I think I fainted. When I woke up, my wife and her doctor were both looking down at me with concern. ""Is he always like this?"" the doctor asked. ""Yes,"" answered my wife, ""but it's been especially bad since the pregnancy."" ""Whose?"" the doctor asked. Everybody laughed. I asked her how this could have happened, and she mentioned intersexualism and chimerism, but I assured her that I was as male as male can be. Nonetheless, she suggested genetic testing. I began to think very hard about when my pregnancy symptoms began, and I realized they all started with the tea. I immediately stopped drinking it, and I began to notice my symptoms slowly disappearing. I had the genetic testing done and all my cells were typically XY male, with no abnormalities. The second ultrasound showed only the appropriate abdominal organs for a male, with no trace of a uterus or fetus. In fact, the only evidence that I had ever been pregnant is a grainy photo from the first ultrasound. The medical community has dismissed my case as mass hysteria, or ""folie &agrave; deux"". They may be at a loss to explain what happened, but I know the truth. …",2 out of 21 users found this review helpful

" 5 stars for chocolate, -1 for service",4,"I've had the privileges of traveling the world, living in Europe for three years, and being able to sample most any food I've had the desire to taste. Chocolate has always been one of my favorite foods. That being said, this is simply the best chocolate I've ever had the privilege to sample. Dozens of subtle flavors dance across the tongue as each type of taste bud brings slight variations in this creamy smooth bittersweet confection. Best experienced by sharing with a friend, although I'm sure other pairings would work well too. Easily 5 stars for the chocolate, and the packaging is quite attractive. However, there is more to the experience than simply the product. In this case, the single 50 gram bar of chocolate costs $12, but the price must include shipping (obviously) which bumps the price to a whopping $22. No significant options are given for shipping, and ""expedited"" means that it will take two weeks for the item to arrive. On the plus side, the chocolate did arrive with a small ice pack, but given that the current ambient temperatures were all well below freezing this seemed rather unnecessary. The item would have been received much faster, cheaper, and probably as in good of condition if it had been mailed via standard US postage. So, I deducted one star for service. I might have thought otherwise had I ordered the item in July; however in that case the single ice pack would not have been enough to survive a two week shipping time. So, overall I highly recommend this chocolate. Given the cost of shipping, I recommend ordering a quantity sufficient to cover the costs. It only makes sense to order many, as once your friends and family discover you have this wonderful chocolate you'll need enough to share! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Makes a Good Gift,4,"This is definitely a quick, easy birthday gift to send someone who you may be unsure what exactly to get them. I sent this as a gift to my mother to supplement something else, and she really enjoyed it. I think it's a pretty generic gift as it's just basically a variety of snacks and candy, but it's a great way to show someone you're thinking about them on their birthday. It's a little hard to tell from the product photo, but it's in a cake-shaped gift bag, which I was a little disappointed in, because I must have thought it would be in something more substantial than a paper gift bag, but all in all, I was happy with the product. …",22 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Where's The Cardamon?  Prepare for the Cloveaload!,1,"If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you. If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is ""this is NOT chai tea."" There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea. As it is, it should be called ""spicy clove tea."" This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices. It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves. I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region. Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors. Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision. I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically. I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a ""traditional"" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand. For all the people out there who know what Indo-Pakistani Chai tastes like, I'll be reviewing each of the ""chai"" K-Cups according to how they resemble the original. …",21 out of 29 users found this review helpful

 A very robust honey with a mutli-floral taste,5,"If you are accustomed to store bought clover honey that is clear to the eye and completely processed (meaning heated mostly), then this honey is going to be a shocker to your eyes and tastebuds. I am a honey lover (I love it straight off the honey comb, off the spoon, on my bagel and in my tea) and am pretty particular about the honey I choose. I think that many of us are so accustomed to those cute little honey bears in the market with clover honey in them that we forget that there is an entire other world of ""raw"" organic and unprocessed honey. This honey however takes raw honey another step further. If you are accustomed to spun honey (thicker and cloudier in color) than you are closer to this honey. Typically honey bees go for the clovers or orange blossoms and you can taste the floral essence in the honey. This honey is produced by the Mayans in Southern Mexico and has a complex taste filled with multi-floral essences. The review says that it has a ""butterscotch"" taste and I would say that descriptor is pretty good. Like a wine, we use many different words (fruits, woods, etc) to describe it's nose and finish. This honey is THAT complex that it really needs to be enjoyed that way and described like wine. It is definitely gourmet. If you enjoy more mild honey, this honey might be just a tad too much for your taste and you might not find it as enjoyable. The honey taste might overshadow whatever you are using it on (toast, etc). However, if you really thrive after a complex taste and enjoy tasting the floral essences, you are in for a SWEET and delightful surprise. This is not your average supermarket honey. It's the champagne of honey that can be enjoyed by connoisseurs who appreciate the floral tones that are so complex. I've never tasted anything like it! Delicious but anything but mild. This honey is not for everyone, but those who love it will certainly love it. I sense that dislike will go in the same direction. When using this honey, think smaller portions because of the pungency. It is anything but mild! I definitely appreciated the fair trade part of purchasing this honey knowing that the Mayans are receiving a fair wage. That makes me feel really good. :) Enjoy. …",33 out of 34 users found this review helpful

" Smells good, but tastes like coffee-flavored water",3,"These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces. It didn't help. I compared them to Senseo medium roast pods. The Senseo pods make a cup of coffee that is stronger but doesn't taste as good. I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee. I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides. As long as I'm having bad coffee, it might as well be organic and fair trade and all. So they are somewhat useful to me, hence three stars. Coffee maker: Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer Update: I stayed in a hotel with a small, cone-type coffee maker (not a Pod system). I put two Marley pods in the maker and made about 12 ounces of coffee, which I ran through the maker a second time (the first time it was very watery looking).

 Greenies - Catnip for dogs,5,"I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful

Not only does it make pods using whatever coffee you like, it makes pods for an 8 oz. cup of coffee! Senseo pods only make a 4 oz. cup of coffee, so you have to use two pods if you want to have a decent size cup of joe. You fill the pod, fold over its top over the coffee, and then seal the pod in 2 to 3 seconds with the pod maker. Incredibly simple. I also have used the Ecopads, which are great also.
