 Magically delicious!,5,"This is the most magical beef jerky I ever ate. It came in many a paper like sheet, and everyone at work loved it. Right after eating aforementioned jerky, I turned into a cow, and spent the rest of the day having a crazy adventure, during witch I stopped a swarm of evil grass from taking over the world. It began when I over herd a rouge blade of grass discussing it with a clover, who he had been ****. I followed him, and finding their hide out, located under the upside down kiddy pool in my yard, I devoured the lot of them. After saving the world, I turned back into a human, and had another piece. It did not happen again, but it must be like Narnia, and when the world needs the cool cow again, I will be ready, watching, and waiting. Oh, and ordering more of this jerky. Review guidelines: Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining? How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it. …",7 out of 16 users found this review helpful

" Tasty and filling, but not low calorie if eaten as a lunch",4,"This is a tasty sweet-ginger curry with chick peas and a few chunks of potato. The sweetness comes from the chick peas themselves, smartly brought out by the spices chosen. The texture of the vegetables is surprisingly good - modestly firm, not an unrecognizable mush. Unlike most prepackaged meals, I don't mind it cold, though it only takes two minutes in the microwave. Each package has 480 calories, which is rather incredible for just 10 ounces of Indian food with no ghee or paneer. In fairness, it is high in fiber and protein and low in bad fats, so it is probably an ideal choice for skinny vegans/vegetarians. But for those like me that eat plenty of dairy and meat but are trying to keep a few meals light but flavorful and filling, there are better options, particularly the Dal Bukara (340 calories) and Rajma Masala (270) by the same maker and several options from MTR or Tasty Bite. ETA: I understand it's technically 2.3 servings, but my original review was geared in terms of a quick office lunch, which is how I most often consume shelf-stable foods like this. For me (tall male), 10 ounces of food is about what I expect for lunch. So I still eat this, but usually as an addition to a family meal with a couple of other dishes and rice. In that context, I full endorse the recommendation of other commenters to heat with a can of regular chickpeas (drained), ideally after sauteing a bit of garlic or onion. The flavor spreads nicely, plus it's a bit healthier and cheaper that way. …",44 out of 44 users found this review helpful
 Great!,5,Ayahuasca Vine alone will not give any pleasant or interesting trip. But combined with mushrooms or DMT it will give an intense trip. This special combination is capable of inducing a powerful psychedelic experience because the MAO inhibitor present in the Ayahuasca preserves the DMT. DMT is a psychoactive chemical which produces intense visuals and strong psychedelic effects but is usually rendered ineffective when taken orally because it is easily broken down by the body's MAO enzyme. …,6 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 I am so disappointed with this company - buyer BEWARE indeed,1,"After reading the reviews here stating that the Iron content of Ella's Kitchen Spinach packs was incorrect, I checked out their website to see for myself. Hmm.. no announcement there stating that an error had been made. So, I contacted the company wondering if it was a misunderstanding. No, it's true. The Spinach flavor only has 4-6% DV of Iron... NOT 120% as has been clearly indicated on the pouches I have been buying for my son for OVER A YEAR! I have been purchasing these packs by the case thinking that if my son did not eat enough other Fe-rich foods on a particular day, at least he would eat this. I mean you know how difficult it can be to get little ones to take in enough iron, so I thought this was a great option. IF I HAD KNOWN that it only contained 4 or 6%, then I would have given my son other additional Fe-rich foods or continued making my own purees. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true when I noticed that the first ingredient is in fact APPLES not Spinach as the front of the pouches would have you believe. What upsets me the most is that there is not even a warning or announcement on Superstore or at Target stores stating that there has been a mistake?!! If the company knows, why isn't this info passed on to the consumer?!!? Here I thought I was purchasing (a more expensive) but also more nutritionally complete product for my baby and to find out it's just as void of nutrients as all of the other brands on the shelves. I really thought this company was exciting and different and focused on kids' nutrition and health. I guess not. I am asking for a refund at the very least. Honestly, the company is lucky if parents don't decide to take up a lawsuit for their negligence in getting the word out. The incorrectly labeled packs should be recalled like anything else- not left on the shelves to trick parents! Normally, I am not one to overact and am certainly not litigious in the least. Humans (and companies run by humans) make mistakes. It's natural. But as a physcian and a mother, I am really annoyed by the lack of respect shown to consumers in failing to notify the community of this error. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Why would anyone buy these?,2,"I bought these to try out based on good Superstore reviews which made them sound like some kind of wonder bars that were healthy and would make you happy for eternity (or something). I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain: These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like ""gluten free"" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat). In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients. Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing. …",2 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Truly Cures or Helps Most Stomach Problems,5,"A miracle in my life! I tried this out of desperation, and it really does work. Over 20% of Americans suffer from Stomach problems and Doctors truly cannot help. They will give you tests, limited diets, medicines and generally albeit Innocently...they do not help.

 0 cal lifewater is the best,5,"I can't find enough of this stuff... It's either becoming very popular or is very under stocked, since I find myself cleaning out the entire stock of the two stores nearest me on a weekly basis. You should be able to find this for 99 cents.... beware, some places charge significantly more. Great for diabetics like me, and very refreshing after a swim or hockey game. I like all the flavors except the red colored ones, acai, and yum berry, which remind me too much of hawaiian punch. I have a lot of food allergies too, but haven't had any problem with any of the 0 calorie lifewaters. I'm a natural skeptic and had to look up the ingredients before adopting something that seemed too good to be true. The sweetener used in this stuff is called Erythritol, which from what I've read is a natural substance from fruit and doesn't have all the side effects other sweeteners do, like promoting cavities, obesity, diabetes, or diarrhea. I took it easy at first because i have sensitive bowels, but have found that i can drink this stuff from morning to night and not have any trouble. Although as with anything I eventually get bored and have to switch back to ice tea for a while. I can't say the same for the regular lifewaters or any other beverage except unsweetened ice tea, and water, which get a little boring after a while. This stuff has helped me kick the soda habit and reduce my appetite... thank you sobe! It would be wonderful if I could have this stuff delivered by the case instead of having to go hunting for it a few bottles at a time. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Would not buy again,1,"I bought these to take by mouth, but after seeing the thick covering decided I didn't want to ingest that material--then decided to use the oil inside the capsule on my skin. When cutting a small hole and squeezing out the oil, I noticed a small pellet that wouldn't melt on my skin in almost all the capsules. Not sure what that material is, but am glad that I decided not to take them internally. Also after doing some reading on Titanium Dioxide (listed as an ingredient)found that it is ""Classified as Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans"" by IARC. Now I plan to stop using it on my skin and throw away the rest of the bottle--should've done my research before buying. …",22 out of 44 users found this review helpful
" Great product, can get cheaper at Target - CHECK FOR RECALLED POUCHES!",4,"We love Happy Tots food. My 12 month old has tried many varieties and loves them all. He has not had one sour face yet! I'm surprised at the price here, you can get this item at Target for $1.09 per pouch which is much less expensive. I guess buying it online is helpful for people who don't have access to a Target or Health food store, and in that case, is worth the price. *** as a special precaution *** A baby food recall just issued by the FDA (Jan. 2010) may have some of the most stomach-churning details I've read in awhile: ""Swollen or leaking pouches may indicate problems with the product, including possible contamination by bacteria that can cause illness, or that the packaging has been compromised and is at risk of bacterial contamination."" The recalled food is made by Happy Baby, and it's a mix of the baby and toddler lines that parents should be throwing out. The recall covers: * HAPPYTOT Green bean, pear & peas, NET WT. 4.22 OZ.

" Yum! A perfect juicy, herbal blend!",5,"My husband and I love the Raspberry Quince tea from Republic of Tea and we actually received this as a sample bag when we ordered the Raspberry Quince bottled tea from RoT. I tried it and have to say that it's really good. The hibiscus tea has a hint of berry and citrus, lending it a nice fruity flavor without being overpowering. The natural sweet flavor is a bonus as it means I can have it without adding any sugar or artificial sweetener. This tea can be steeped hot or as iced tea. The tea is also caffeine-free, and the main ingredients are hibiscus (flower), sweet blackberry (leaf), and stevia (leaf). Refreshing and wonderful! …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 I'm a newbie at this!,4,"I am new to sprouting. The Sproutmaster gets great reviews from other exclusive sprouting sites. I like the design and the stack-ability. I have sprouted twice in it so far, and both times my sprouts got white mold on them and had to be tossed. I am doing something wrong and will need to do some more research. I would like for the directions to address this problem, but they do not. I bought this to replace my jar method, which did not mold, but I have yet to learn the ""technique."" If you know what you are doing, I'm sure it is great. I know the first time I sprouted, it molded because I had the bottom upside down and there was no ventilation. The second time, I'm not sure what I did wrong. It is definitely my mistake and not the product. Hope this helps! …",19 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 ****-e Diem,2,"I apologize to the makers of this drink for saying this, but it is just not good. At all. To be honest I think it tastes curiously like mouthwash. I can't really get past that and enjoy it. It's almost like mint tea that has waaaaay too much sugar in it or something. I am a HUGE fan of Synergy/GT's Kombucha, but I thought I'd try this because it's slightly cheaper. I have to say that the Synergy is well worth the extra $12 per 12 bottle case (I purchase the cases at Whole Foods for $35). Even if I could get past the minty mouthwash taste, I still have to question the health benefits of this brand of Kombucha given the ingredients list. It reads: Lightly carbonated water, sucrose, herbal tea blend, Kombucha cultures, lactobacilli, acerola juice concentrate. You don't even get to kombucha until the fourth ingredient - and that comes after water and sugar?? One can drink seltzer water with sugar and ""herbal tea"" for much cheaper than $23/12 bottles. Seriously. Spend the extra few bucks and buy the Synergy, whose ingredients are as follows (this is for the ""Trilogy"" flavor): 95% GT's organic raw kombucha, raspberry juice, lemon juice, fresh pressed ginger juice, and 100% pure love. Bottom line, if you want mint soda, then by all means, seize the day. If you want real, raw kombucha with health benefits AND a delicious taste, go for Synergy/GT's Kombucha. …",40 out of 41 users found this review helpful
" Not the greatest, but not the worst either.",3,"I drink espresso (moka) daily, and go through a 250g/8.8oz brick in about 2 weeks. In my opinion, this isn't the greatest blend from Lavazza that I've had, but it's not the worst coffee I've had either (it definitely beats the drip coffee I'd otherwise get at work). It's a 70/30 robusta/arabica blend, a dark roast with a fruity though noticeably bitter finish (but not as bad as Starbucks or Peet's coffee). The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee. I'd really give it a 2.5 or 3 but then again, all taste is subjective, That being said, this is a reasonable coffee (considering taste vs. price), but I'll probably switch back to my regular (and unfortunately more expensive) blend. …",16 out of 19 users found this review helpful
" Easy, quick, and great tasting capsules",5,"I bought the Dolce Gusto machine in 2008, and have been an avid fan of the machine and the capsules ever since. While I do have a couple pointers (not quite complaints, but advice to make your Dolce Gusto experience better) that pertain to the machine itself -- and thus the final coffee product -- I feel the capsules themselves are not at fault for any of the machine's problems. After many days of getting used to the machine, I've found that loosely following the recommended milliliter measurements on the boxes is a good start, and from there it's up to you. Personally, I do just the recommended amount of milk and then pour the espresso until I see the tiniest hint of transparency in the flow. From there I wait anywhere from half a minute to a few minutes (the longer you wait, the more espresso left in the capsule makes it's way to the bottom ready to get the last flush of hot water...but at the same time, the more the foam melts into the coffee), depending on what other busy morning activities I've gotten myself into while preparing the drink, and then push another few seconds worth of espresso out of the capsule. Does this make a world of difference in strength? I doubt it...but it gives me just that much darker of a drink and it makes me feel like I'm getting the most bang for my buck. Ofcourse, the fact that I can get that much more espresso out of the capsule by waiting a bit isn't necessarily all the capsule's fault, but it is truly my only caveat (I also wonder if it's possible to make recyclable capsules...). Either way, unless I've really overdone the amounts of milk or espresso (or haven't gotten back to the machine in time to turn it off), getting a 'watered-down' cappuccino is not possible and, in my opinion, purely an 'operator problem' (see tip above). Also something to note: a generally accepted typical single shot of espresso is made up of 8g of ground coffee and the final product shouldn't be any more than 35mL. The instructions on the package tell you to pour about 40mL (and there is exactly 8g of espresso in the capsule). In other words, if you overdo the espresso capsule, you'll be getting a noticeably watered down espresso (as for the whole cappuccino, I usually can't tell if I've overdone it a touch). Guests have always commented on the excellent look (use clear glasses for quite the show), feel, and taste of the foam and milk. I have to agree that compared to using other capsule-based machines where one has to purchase an extra milk-frother (and deal with the clean-up, supplies, etc), this system easily produces a comparable (at least) milk and foam experience, with very little hassle (if any). When it comes to flavors, there's been a long-standing tie between Cappuccino and the Macchiato in my household. We tend to always have a supply of Cappuccino around with the occasional box of Macchiatto every month or two. Cappuccino is definitely a favorite. Top notch. Never had a problem with a bad after-taste, or at least nothing but the great taste of good espresso. For those who like to know where their coffee comes from: the milk is from France and the coffee capsules are from England (although the actual 100% ground and roasted arabica beans themselves, I don't know). Also, there's 8g of ground coffee in the espresso capsules (the Latte Macchiato has less -- in fact, the Macchiato box recommends 50mL of espresso for a capsule that contains 6.5g...in other words, the amount of espresso that you'd find in a fairly small single shot with the amount of water reserved for a small double shot...perhaps one of the reasons I tend to prefer the Cappuccino). And ofcourse, buying the boxes from Superstore with the subscribe and save is the most inexpensive option I've found. Also, make sure to sign-up online at Dolce Gusto's website for the award points you get with every box. With a box of three from Superstore (through subscribe and save), AND factoring in the 10 award points you get with every box (with which you can redeem Superstore gift cards), the price per box drops to a little over 7 dollars (compared to ~9 dollars a box at Sur la Table and other retailers). And since I'm a money-saving statistics addict, I'm especially happy about the fact that the online rewards program keeps track of all the points you've ever recorded (thus telling me how many boxes I've ever purchased). This helps me calc. how much money I've saved in total in comparison to, say, Starbucks. All in all, if you're not quite willing to shell out major bucks for a real espresso machine, and have limited counter-space to begin with, the Dolce Gusto machine is an easy choice (they just released new and improved versions, too). **And, as of early October '10, they've revamped their boxes, giving them a classier, more matte-like finish (along with a recycle symbol on the bottom) and a cleaner look in terms of pictures and text. Great improvement to the design, and a fun, refreshing face-lift.** In terms of capsules, the Cappuccino is a solid choice -- a staple in my cabinet. …",43 out of 44 users found this review helpful

 My girlfriend likes it,5,"With British food's reputation for tasting like recycled garbage, and a dubious name at best, Spotted **** sounds more like leftovers from the Saw movies than anything edible.

Straying from the typical rubbage on British plates, the injection of flavor from Spotted **** is a welcome taste. A sweet treat with hints of cinnamon, this is perfect for a party filled with **** hungry guests. At ten ounces, each can is roughly four servings based upon the nutritional facts. That's roughly 1000 calories with about 360 of them fat calories for a total of 40 grams of fat. To say that this **** is fat would be an understatement.

However, I was told two weeks ago, a new product had been mailed.... it never came, as patiently as I waited and even commuicated with the seller. When I finally received it, today the post mark date was exactly one week ago to today's date, meaning they did not mail it when they said they did. The post mark date was nearly a week after the date they told me they sent a new product. The plant was ok - I was really disappointed - expecting something somewhat bigger and prettier. …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 2 out of 3 ain't bad,4,"I got my 3 month old puppy this starter set. Like most reviewers, my puppy: a: chewed on the flexi-chew chicken bone for a long time b: ignored the white durachew bone c: devoured the edible chew bacon bone I will definitely buy her the flexi-chew bones. People are right about the pieces breaking off in chunks larger than `rice' size, but the package says that ""rice-sized pieces should pass."" I don't think that means it will break in rice-sized pieces; it means that in the event a rice-sized piece breaks off and the dog swallows it, it should pass...should I type rice-sized piece one more time? I just did. My pup chewed off pieces that were consistently larger than rice-sized (Oh! Did it again!) and spent a good 5min. trying to chew each piece down if I could not stick my fingers in her throat to grab it. I crate my pup and would not let her have this bone in the crate because of the pieces that break off. Also, it is down to a size that would easily fit in her mouth so that she could attempt to swallow, which means it is going in the garbage for a brand new one. The white durachew bone will be saved for when she has her adult teeth and wants to chew on something forever. The edible bacon bone will be left in the wind since she gets treats as it is. I was honestly thinking, ""WTF?"" when she crushed it in 5min until I realized it was the edible chew. She loved it, but it might've spoiled her dinner...probably not, but still...it's funny to think that. Anyway, is it worth it to get this pack? Yes. One Nylabone is about $4. You get this pack for about $7. If your pup doesn't go for the durachew now, s/he will in a month or 2 (depending on age). You can also see how your pup reacts to the bacon bone: okay potties or loose potties. Then, you have an idea of where you should you invest your money. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 NO CURRY !!!  And you pay for packaging...,1,"NO CURRY. These products contain ""Red Chili Powder"". And too much of it. In addition, each package has over 30% sodium! Each package arrives with a free CD promoting their mission. We now have 6 CD's of the same music!! The portions are NOT as photographed. Maybe for two people, maybe. The ""Spinach with Cottage Cheese"" has 4 cubes among a small portion of spinach sauce. Not even worth the time to heat. The flavor is good, with the above exceptions.

 Most Delicious Way to Get your Wakeup Zinger,5,"I am a coffee drinker of the first order. I used to drink a couple pots a day, but now I've cut way, way back, so now that I'm not into quantity, I'm into quality. I really enjoy, really savior a good cuppa joe. I've given up my Mr. Coffee and now have a Home Brewing System and I make my coffee a cup at a time and I really love it. It only takes a minute to make a cup and each cup is different, depending on my mood. I've been drinking K-cup coffee for a couple years now and have more of these little cups in my house than you can shake a stick at. For awhile I used a Carosel , made by Keurig, but I had to keep filling it and also it was kind of clumsy for me. Besides, my coffee affliction is way to huge to be held down to a little spinning coffee merry-go-round. For the first few months my coffee problem went spinning out of control. I had boxes and boxes of coffee in my pantry, refrigerator, cupboards, garage, even in the trunk of my car, but now I've sort of got my gourmet coffee disorder in hand and down to twenty-eight flavors. For Breakfast I have my favorite seven and they are: Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Fair Trade Nicaraguan, Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Bold, Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend, Tully's French Roast Coffee K-Cups, Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast, Timothy's World Coffee, Morning Blend and Coffee People Coffee, Wake Up Call Bold. For Lunch I have my favorite seven and they are: Gloria Jean's Coffees Hazelnut Coffee, Emeril's K-cups, Big Easy Bold, Gloria Jean's Coffees, Black Gold Extra Bold, Timothy's World Coffee, Private Blend, Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Parisian Nights, Timothy's World Coffee, Colombian La Vereda and Gloria Jean's Coffees GJ Special Blend And for dinner, yes I drink coffee in the evening as well, but that's not so bad, considering I don't drink alcohol, don't smoke, don't eat sweets and eat very little meat. Sometimes I'll eat meat, but not often, so a cup of coffee with dinner doesn't seem so bad, considering. If it kept me up at night, well then that would be different, but it doesn't. Anyway for dinner I'll drink one of these seven: Tully's Full City Roast Coffee, Gloria Jean's Coffee, Mudslide, Timothy's World Coffee, Italian Blend, Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups Dark Magic Extra Bold, Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark and Gloria Jean's Coffee, Classic Reserve. And then there is my absolute favorite, number twenty-two and that is Bold Rainforest Espresso , a Timothy's World Coffee. I keep my k-cups in three large assorted tupperware tubs, marked in red sharpie, of course, Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. So when I reach into the breakfast tub for example, I never know which of the seven flavors that I'm going to wind up with. I don't drink coffee during my meal, but afterwards, instead of desert. It's a quiet time for me. I think and reflect over my coffee as I delight in each and every sip. I know for some, having twenty-two different flavors of coffee in my kitchen might seem a bit much, maybe even a bit quirky, well everyone's gotta have their quirks, besides, I've cut way down. Now, about that twenty-second flavor. When I absolutely have to have an extra cup during that quiet, coffee drinking them, then that's the flavor I go for. How often does that happen, when one cup isn't enough? Only about once a day. Still, from two pots a java a day, down to four cups, is a pretty good thing, I'm not as wired as I used to be, but let's face it, I'm still running on coffee. That's not so bad though, better a coffee crutch than something else. In my opinion these are the twenty-two best cups of joy in the whole wide world. At least the best twenty-two flavors I've come across in the hundreds I've tried. But please don't take my word as gospel, everybody's different. You have to dive right right in, take a chance, try several flavors till you find the one or the twenty-two that you like best. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful

The texture is pretty substandard compared to wasabi peas--they're a little bit cardboardy and they make my mouth feel dry. They also taste under-salted to me.

" Inconsistent! Some boxes good, some sour ***See appended note!",2,"I bought a lot of boxes of vita coco from Superstore these past few months due to the sale/special offers lately. 2 boxes (both were the small size) tasted great! (1 carton had a weird taste). I said whatever and bought the larger size. YUCK! I drank the first two and they tasted sour. I compared them side by side with the other vita coco I had (the smaller cartons) and these taste really different. I opened a few more to try, and some were okay, and others sour. UGH. I don't care how good some of these boxes are! If they vary this much, it's not worth it to me to try again. *Edited to add: I emailed vita coco and told them about this and they told me they had a bad batch.

 An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee,5,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday. I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now). However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee. I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"". Enter Donut Blend. I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family. When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it. Here is my take on it: It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity. Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii. It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee. If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup. Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one. Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.

I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it's all gone. Then I grab another and do it all over again!

I follow a high protein diet and this Black Bean soup is loaded with both fiber and protein without sacrificing taste. Just add boiling or very hot water and you can easily eat it at your desk as it takes up about as much space as a large coffee mug. Many reviewers find the sodium content high and, as with most soups, it is. A good workaround to resolve this is to pour in about half of the flavor packet. There is minimal flavor change and a decrease (even though it may be slight) in sodium.

 Solid Medium Roast Coffee with Just a Hint of Bold. Good Flavor. Not Acidic.,5,"Good choice for your morning coffee if you like a medium, slightly bold flavor.

 Delicious topping with Japanese flair!,5,"I know, some of you may be thinking, GROSS! Fish shavings?? But if you like fish, and the flavors of Japanese food, then you'll love these Bonito Flakes. This brand's individual packages is very convenient and ensures that you always have the freshest serving. Bonito flakes are part of the base soup stock in miso soup, so you've probably had a taste of it without even knowing it. Don't think they are only good for stocks, however. The flakes themselves are a delicious addition to a block of cold tofu with some soy sauce, and also on a bowl of steamed rice, again with a little soy sauce. They are also great when mixed with fresh cucumber slices and soy sauce. If you're getting the drift, they are much more flavorful when a drizzle of soy sauce is added too. Bonito flakes, called ""hanakatsuo"" in Japanese, are a fabulous source of protein and are a quick and easy way to add a lot of taste to even a plain bowl of rice.

 Delicious new limited flavors,5,"These appeared singly in my local grocery store and in the 3 flavor pack in my local warehouse store (BJs) for about three bucks a canister. They were marked as being for a limited time and they're all gone now, so the only place I know to get them is Superstore. My stash of Mojito mix is already gone. The three flavors are Mojito, Margarita, and Appletini. The Mojito and Margarita are refreshing and very similar to the real mixes that I get at the store. The difference is, I can (and do!) drink this stuff all day long without any guilt since it's 5 calories a serving. Mojito: like limeade with a hint of mint, so good over ice! Muddle some mint for an extra delicious treat, use club soda for mint juleps, or even add alcohol. Margarita: tastes like Jose Cuervo margarita mixer to me, it even has the salty tang. Appletini: the more I've had it, the less I like it. It's a bit strong on the fake-apple taste and smell, so it's like drinking a Jolly Rancher green apple candy. These are a wonderful treat!

 These delicious prunes (dried plums) reduce bowel transit time & feed friendly bacteria,5,"Newman's own Organics California Prunes (dried plums) are the best tasting prunes I've ever had. Prunes are well known for their ability to prevent constipation. In addition to providing bulk and decreasing the transit time of fecal matter, thus decreasing the risk of colon cancer and hemorrhoids, prunes' insoluble fiber also provides food for the ""friendly"" bacteria in the large intestine. When these helpful bacteria ferment prunes' insoluble fiber, they produce a short-chain fatty acid called butyric acid, which serves as the primary fuel for the cells of the large intestine and helps maintain a healthy colon. These helpful bacteria also create two other short-chain fatty acids, propionic and acetic acid, which are used as fuel by the cells of the liver and muscles. The propionic acid produced from prunes' insoluble fiber may also be partly responsible for the cholesterol-lowering properties of fiber. In animal studies, propionic acid has been shown to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in the production of cholesterol by the liver. By lowering the activity of this enzyme, propionic acid helps lower blood cholesterol levels. In addition, prunes' soluble fibers help to lower cholesterol by binding to bile acids and removing them from the body via the feces. Bile acids are compounds used to digest fat that are manufactured by the liver from cholesterol. When they are excreted along with prunes' fiber, the liver must manufacture new bile acids and uses up more cholesterol, thus lowering the amount of cholesterol in circulation. Soluble fiber may also reduce the amount of cholesterol manufactured by the liver. A study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine confirms that eating high fiber foods, such as prunes, helps prevent heart disease. Almost 10,000 American adults participated in this study and were followed for 19 years. People eating the most fiber, 21 grams per day, had 12% less coronary heart disease (CHD) and 11% less cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to those eating the least, 5 grams daily. Those eating the most water-soluble dietary fiber fared even better with a 15% reduction in risk of CHD and a 10% risk reduction in CVD. Lastly, the insoluble fiber provided by prunes feed friendly bacteria in the digestive tract, which helps to maintain larger populations of friendly bacteria. In addition to producing the helpful short-chain fatty acids described above, friendly bacteria play an important protective role by crowding out pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria and preventing them from surviving in the intestinal tract. …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 Mixed feelings on this.,2,"I'm torn on this dog food. On one hand, my dogs love it. The bowl doesn't stay full for very long. They've been so picky with dog food that it was a relief to find something they would willingly eat. However, my Corgi liked to just pick out the soft pieces and leave the hard food for my Chihuahua. Because she only ate the soft pieces and gorged until the bowl was empty, my Corgi became overweight and her dental health suffered. We had to switch to a different brand to keep her healthy. I agree with the other reviewer who feels the packaging is false advertising. There is no meat or vegetables in Beneful. It says right on here that the first two ingredients are ground cornmeal and chicken by-product. Yuck! That really grossed me out. I don't want my dogs eating this anymore and switched them to a more wholesome brand. …",9 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Possibly the best small dog food,5,"I've got a small poodle-mix. I've tried almost every premium food for my dog. With completely grain free foods, I've seen the coat dry out and become dull. Solid Gold produced too much gas. Canidae ALF and grain-free went too stale for her taste in less than two weeks. The other foods I've attempted simply were rejected. Wellness Small Breed to me is a miracle. She will even eat it without having to load it up with cheese. Her coat is a shiny silver. She's actually grown a healthy undercoat. Like most little dogs with allergies, I've noticed the eye discharge is minimal compared to other foods. So for any super-finicky small dog parent, I would definitely recommend this kibble. …",24 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Dry aftertaste dulls appreciation,2,"I was really excited about ordering this set and thrilled when it came. I have noticed something unexpected about the teas, however. With the teas I have tried from this set I have noticed an unpleasant dry aftertaste. Another taster noticed the same thing without my mentioning it. I really like the glass tea pot. It is very nice to watch the tea fill the glass orb with color and flavor. Whether the flowers are beautiful or look more like sea urchins will be a matter of personal taste. I had high hopes for the Starlight Rose Tea (white tea leaves with rosebud) and found it far inferior to Rose Petal Black Blended Tea by The Republic of Tea, which is excellent. On the other hand, Numi's Moroccan Mint is one of the finest teas I have ever tasted, superior to an old favorite of mine- Stash Tea Moroccan Mint. After tasting this tea I am surprised by the number of reviews rating the tea that comes with the set as quite good. Maybe I got a bad batch or have strange taste buds- but there it is. The bamboo box is quite charming. …",21 out of 24 users found this review helpful
" Easy, pleasant, high fiber intake; easier, more pleasant, higher gram count than Metamucil.  Rich, crunchie bran flavor!",5,"For all the trouble to take Metamucil, for its fiber content, the gram fiber count ""ain't"" much; 5 grams. Fiber one is a crunchy, flavorful, bran tasty, cereal which, in 4 oz gives one 14 grams of fiber. One cup of Fiber One equals 28 grams of fiber. When I stop to think of the ordeal involved taking Metamucil for 5 grams of fiber, though ignorant of the existence of Fiber One, and its 14-28 grams of fiber, I could commit Hari Kari! The cereal is as tasty as ones favorite cereal, a pleasant surprise, and by adding a pear to this morning cereal one hits the 30+ grams recommended by the medics.

 Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS,1,"We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb. …",8 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 worst feeling ever!,1,"I decided to try 5 hour energy after it was recommended to me by my Dad. I have been drinking ""Go Girls"" for a while and I loved them. I wanted to try the 5 hour energy because the ""Go Girls"" kept me up at night. First of all, I understand first hand that this drink affects people differently. Like I said my Dad loves it and swears by it, myself, not so much. I decided to drink only half the bottle to start with, so it wouldn't be too overwhelming. But, even with half the bottle it really messed me up. I felt tired but my heart wouldn't stop racing. It was pounding so much, like I just ran 10 miles in record time! The rest of my body felt awful too. My arms were jittery, yet kinda numb. My legs felt like spaghetti and my stomach felt like it was in knots. Andy even though my body felt like it was all amped up I still felt exhausted and needed to keep putting my head down. I also felt like I just wanted to have a meltdown and cry. It was awful! Be careful if you try this. Take a little bit at a time. For the first time take it when you don't need to do anything or go anywhere. Like I said everyone reacts differently to it. My Dad has these like 2 or 3 times a week and loves it. So try it for yourself, but this was my experience. …",59 out of 81 users found this review helpful
 Newman's Own Organics Dog Food,5,"I cannot express enough how pleased I am with this dog food. I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding. For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems. Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food. After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me. Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is. I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority. I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair ****. I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go. I highly recommend Newman's Own dog and cat food. I also feed my two dogs Newman's Own biscuits as treats. …",88 out of 89 users found this review helpful
" Good quality, but...",3,"Let me start by saying that these chocolate bars are very good quality, and I love stevia. I love dark chocolate! But I don't know what I'm going to do with these eight bars, because I just don't like them. I use the NOW stevia extract powder brand in my tea and coffee. I have even substituted half the palm sugar called for in a delicious almond flour scone recipe with stevia. That seems to be my problem with many stevia recipes and products out there. Since I am neither diabetic nor overweight, I'm just looking for healthier alternatives to my favorite high sugar foods, most of which are really just treats- like chocolate. Even as a stevia convert, this chocolate tastes overwhelmingly like stevia and the accompanying bitterness about which I have heard so many people complain (and I'm not talking about the yummy, slightly bitter chocolate flavor). The chocolate quality, like I said, is excellent. The product arrived very quickly and in terrific condition. But the flavor would be greatly improved if both sugar and stevia were used. I'm very happy for those who love this chocolate, especially if they are unable to eat sugar and would not be able to eat chocolate otherwise, but... yuck! For people like me- I'm looking for healthier options that also taste good! On a side note- I have read that medium sugar foods don't break down into fat as easily when they are also high in fiber. For example- juice is bad, fruits are good. Juice has had the fiber extracted, therefore it isn't as healthy as fruit, which has fiber to balance. And so maybe the case for a *little* sugar in chocolate (combined with stevia) is more justifiable because the high fiber would provide balance? Great product for those who would otherwise be unable to eat chocolate:) Updated suggestion: I've been baking with erythritol (a sugar alcohol, that is neither a sugar nor an alcohol, found naturally in cantaloupes, grapes, etc.) with great success. How about a combo of stevia, erythritol and palm sugar? Erythritol can have a diuretic effect if over consumed, but nothing is good for us in large quantities and I've never had a problem! Update #2- Silk has a Vanilla Soymilk Light product that contains sugar and stevia. The resulting product? delicious and very low carb/ sugar. Zevia's line of stevia/ erythritol cokes are also delicious with almost zero carbs. With a little support from regular sugar or erythritol, stevia works outstandingly well and the product isn't anywhere close (carb-wise) to similar, full sugar products. (Doesn't require a whole lot of sugar to make stevia palatable). …",23 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 small bar for a high price with an untrue claim and hidden fructose,2,"As a person who is more involved with health and nutrition than the average person that has also purchased raw food bars before, I was happy that this was offered though the Superstore Vine program and I glady ordered the sample. It tastes good and it claims to contain ""nothing cooked, nothing processed,"" but that is not the simple truth. The bar contains ""agave nectar"" which does not occur naturally. It is not unprocessed and it is in fact, a highly cooked and processed sweetener. It is derived from processing and cooking the core of the blue agave plant for many hours in order to break down its starches into sugars. Agave nectar was originally touted as a ""healthy alternative"" to table sugar, but it is potentially much worse than table sugar on your body. It is essentially a super high fructose syrup, just like high fructose corn syrup, but with a much higher fructose content. Typical high fructose corn syrup used in soft drinks is about 55% fructose while agave nectar contains a whopping 85-90% fructose. First of all, I don't understand why they thought they needed to sweeten this ""raw"" bar, and second, they used ""agave nectar"" which sounds good to the uninformed, but it is not a raw ingredient and it has a very high fructose content. I think they used ""agave nectar"" to hide the additional fructose (or sugar) on the label. There is controversy, but fructose and particularly agave nectar may be bad for you. You can research for yourself, google ""agave nectar bad"" and look for entries from ""foodrenegade,"" ""nourishedkitchen"" and ""living-foods"" You can also google ""fructose bad"" check out the hits from ""about"" and ""the american journal of clinical nutrition"" Fructose and in particular, High Fructose Corn Syrup are the subjects of much controversy today. There are studies that conclude that there is no appreciable difference between sucrose and fructose to our bodies (and of course, fructose is a component of sucrose). There are also studies that indicate fructose may be problematic. Regardless of which camp you're in, ""agave nectar"" is a hidden source of fructose in this bar and it is not raw. The fact that the manufacturer of this bar claims ""nothing cooked and nothing processed"" is nothing short of fraud. …",63 out of 82 users found this review helpful
