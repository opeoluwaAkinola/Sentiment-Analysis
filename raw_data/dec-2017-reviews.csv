" Not too weak, not too strong, it's juuuuuust right",5,"I found these first at my local supermarket. I've been looking for a blend that I could use as my standard every-day cup of coffee and, finally, this was it. I've tried so many of the other blends and brands and they were either harsh and bitter (I know, some people think coffee *should* taste that way!) or too bland and weak. This is smooth but with a nice ""coffee"" presence you can actually taste. *Coffee* taste, not burned grounds! I highly recommend this if you're *not* into the ""make your hair stand on end"" type of coffee. This review is based on using the ""medium"" size on the coffee machine. You may get different results if you use the small or large dispenser sizes. …",66 out of 66 users found this review helpful
" cool, but flat",4,"It's a cool little basket, and the stuff inside looks great. The only problem I have is that I'm going to have to take it out of the wrap and make it look pretty. No biggie, really, but you should know that the stuff is crammed into the basket, and really doesn't look that great (presentation wise) I can't wait to give it as a gift though. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Please avoid!!,1,"Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats. Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients. They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food. This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school. Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness. Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. Please try another brand like orijen or evo. your cat will thank you. …",8 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Almost five stars,4,"Our office recently (and possibly misguidedly) voted a Starbucks machine off the island and replaced it with a couple of Bunn airpot makers. They're great for commercial coffee but that is also the problem: it tastes like mediocre diner coffee even when good beans are used. So I've taken matters into my own hands and picked up an Espressione Cafe Novecento espresso maker and have put it in the kitchen ""on loan"" to the company. My first few attempts at pulling a decent shot with fresh ground coffee convinced me that I simply don't have the patience to learn the proper technique so, as the machine came with a pod portafilter, I decided to give that a shot (so to speak). Illy had the highest number of positive recomendations so I settled on them for my initial foray. Simply put, I am impressed. The flavor is excellent, the output takes in the ballpark of 20-30 seconds a shot and has very good crema on about three out of every four shots. It can be tricky to properly seat the pod in the portafilter but moistening the pod first does help and that's a more a reflection on the filter design than the pod's. The primary reason I can't give five stars (although I'd do four and a half if I could) is that even the Superstore price works out to almost a dollar a shot so my double Americano in the morning is only slightly less than I'd pay my favorite barista. And she has a really cute smile. All in all, though, a very positive experience and I recommend the Illy pods. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 The Best Chips...PERIOD!,5,"You don't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips. And these chips prove it. The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best. …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 You have got to be kidding me!,1,"I tried this yesterday...frontier flapjacks? You gotta be kidding me! I never do a review and if something is bad I usually just toss it, but these were so lame I had to say something. Even on sale, they were a waste of money. There is nothing hearty about them, they stuck to the pan, then fell apart (even after leaving them on longer (I know how to make german and american pancakes (with everything in them); so, this was ridiculous)). All I wanted to do was see what a flapjack tasted like. I love to hike; so, this seemed intriguing. I can't imagine frontierfolks eating these and being able to do all the things they needed to do.

 A Beacon for Bacon,5,"Neuske's Bacon is simply the most divine bacon eating experience you'll ever have. Smoked in Wisconsin over applewood, it is delectable, luscious even. They cut it lean so that there is no rubbery, fatty bits like you find in store-bought brands, yet they leave enough in to give it that robust flavor. It is worth noting that America's Test Kitchen did a Taste Test of Bacon, in which Neuske's was a participant. It did NOT come out as No.1, because tasters thought it was ""too smoky"". If you like smoky bacon like I do, that sounds like crazy talk, and you should definitely try this bacon. The results of the taste test indicates to me that there are those who prefer their bacon less smoky, and I suppose that if you are one of those people, you may not like this bacon after all (even thought it is the best ever). Be careful though: once you eat Neuske's and love it, you won't be satisfied with store-bought ever again! …",26 out of 29 users found this review helpful
" Spoil yourself, you deserve it!",5,"I have been a long time devotee of White Truffle oils, but somehow I had been out of the gourmet loop, unaware of the growing popularity of Black Truffle Sea Salt. My curiosity was piqued, when I saw an Iron Chef using it on the Food Network, and, then by the outstanding reviews on Superstore. Well, thanks to ALL, unknowingly complicit in leading me astray, I now have an expensive habit; but don't we all deserve to indulge ourselves, once in a while? Since this is my first purchase, I can't make comparisons, but I can say this, the fragrance and taste are moderately strong for BT infusion, when you consider the contrast in pricing for this product, over others. It's a great entry point for those without much experience with Truffles, white, or black, to give it a try. Be careful though, you'll likely be hooked, too. Since it takes such a small amount of product to enhance flavor, the 5.5 oz supply should last a fairly long time. The container is nice enough to leave on display. It has a pop-up, sprinkle lid, for convenience. The container does not offer a percentage, nor does the website, so I'm not sure if this Fusion brand is 10%, or not, as some other brands' advertise. So on my next purchase, I will opt for one that designates such, just for comparison. I consider flavor enhancers, such as Truffles, to be a diet aide, when watching calories. If you feel you are having something delectable, it heightens the sense of satisfaction---that somehow your sacrifices are lessened. For example, I was blown away by the taste of a simple boiled egg, with a dusting of BTSS---and, vegetables reach new heights, as well. And, don't get me started on, plain pasta, with only a little Truffle oil, and sprinkle of BTSS; it's decadent. Actually, I think I could take a chunk of Iceberg lettuce, give it a sprinkle, and feel I was having a treat. If you've not yet ventured into BTSS, give it a whirl. I doubt you will be disappointed. …",50 out of 50 users found this review helpful

 Best Deal Yet!,5,"I drink a lot of tea, and over the years I have done my own research. Inevitably, I discovered matcha, its abundant health benefits and its ease of preparation. Few who are not avid tea enthusiasts or those who don't drink high quality teas for their staggering health benefits, or gift of wellness, might not favor the taste of matcha. However, for the majority, matcha honestly does not taste bad, and if you disagree, just add some sweetness to it, like some agave, honey, lemon, stevia, or sugar. You could even mix up the condiments to create your own nirvana for your taste buds. Anyways, through all my searching for organic matcha, SerendipiTea offers the best price, and consistent availability I've seen yet!

" Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me",5,"I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store. I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie. In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion. Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me. This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber. While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar. Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************,2,"First off, the initial arrival: It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat! Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary. Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective; 1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces 2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several. 3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging. In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags. Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's. Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way. But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Superstore charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping). If you wanted to buy using Superstore Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings. An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats …",1 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Refuting the 2-Star Review.,5,"Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation. So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked ""natural""), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those. Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.

 Being Naked Is Good!,5,"I love granola and cereal in general, but I have to say that this is the very best granola I have ever had. The people at Bear Naked have a philosophy that I love, and which is on the back of every bag: ""we believe food should be hand-made from wholesome and natural ingredients you can actually pronounce."" Although I do eat processed food, I appreciate the appeal of the more traditionally prepared foods, and this granola tops the list for nutrition and taste. Like most granola, it is high in calories and fat, but take note that the fat comes largely from the nuts contained (it also contains expeller pressed canola oil), and it has no trans fat, and only 1.5g of saturated fat per serving. This cereal is softer than most granola, though not soft enough for me to consider it chewy. It does have large chunks of nuts and also contains cranberries and flax seed, for optimal nutritional and digestive health. The six-pack sold on Superstore makes the price per package reasonable (the ingredients are quite expensive), so as a value proposition, I think this is not only a great product, but a great buy. Delicious and nutritious: a great combination that I recommend highly. …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 Excellent,5,"I've come to trust the Stash brand, among only a few others due to its consistently excellent product line and variety. I was initially a fan of English Breakfast tea, but was introduced to Irish Breakfast tea some time back. A slightly thicker liquor produced than does English Breakfast, it mixes well with a variety of items (sugar and milk are recommended, but certain alcoholic bases or mixers sit quite nicely if you want to switch up the classic Hot Toddy concept or use Kahlua instead of sugar), and has an even stronger aroma and flavor than your regular black tea. If you're a fan of weaker brews where one or two dunks is good enough, this is not for you. I tend to steep this for a long while (tea experts would call me nuts for doing this as it could scald and alter the flavor of the leaves), but I love the strength of the brew afterwards. This is great to have on-the-go, too, and hearty to drink if you're ill and require a lot of liquids. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Good for teeth AND stress,5,"CET Chews Petite for Small Dogs (30 chews) My dog loves all sizes of these CET Chews. She is a 15 pound Bichon Frise who loves to chew to relieve stress, but only bones, rawhide, or similar chewables. I've heard mixed reviews on rawhide in general, but in the last few years rawhide chews started giving her terribly smelly gas, enough to clear the room! We have discovered, however, that the CET chews do not have that effect, and they help to relieve her stress as well as clean her teeth. We recently switched to the smaller chews because even though she manages the larger chews just fine, we decided it was better to give her smaller ones more often than a big one just occasionally, and that it's probably easier on her small digestive system. Anyway, we love these and would recommend anyone whose dog enjoys chewing to give these a try. Do keep in mind that whenever your pet is chewing something like this that they should be monitored, though we have never had a minute's trouble with these. Thanks! …",69 out of 73 users found this review helpful
 Why can't anyone make a hot cocoa without sucralose/Splenda in it?,3,"I HATE SUCRALOSE. Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising. That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition. Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run). There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find. My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me. So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option. Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere. UPDATE: I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing. UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets. I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself. So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant. 43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon. …",187 out of 216 users found this review helpful

 The price is right,5,"We have a little Maltese that we spoil to no end. These treats are the perfect size for him and he loves them. He can be a little picky. Among his daily treats are Greenies and since we found these on Superstore, Zuke's Jerky Naturals. I will say that we tried two different kinds. Along with these, we tried the WellBites Chicken and Venison Recipe Dog Treats, 8-Ounce Pouch . The Zuke's are really potent. When you open the bag, you catch a big whiff of how strong they are. They're probably real flavorful because of it (I didn't try one). The Wellness treats seem a little dryer. While our little guy likes both of the treats, the Zuke's win over the Wellness. Plus they're cheaper so that's even better. He can't get enough of them. We also tried the Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch made by Zuke's. He doesn't like those as much as the Greenies. I would say that this product is one of the best we found for our dog. Plus we were able to take advantage of the free super saver shipping as well. These are highly recommended. [Edit: August 14, 2011] He still loves them! We've had to start giving our little guy Remedel for a little shoulder injury he had. These Zukes make it real easy to give him the pill. Since they're moist, we just put the pill inside and press it all around the pill. That way he doesn't even know he's taking it. Trying to give him pills with the Wellness treats doesn't work so well since they're dryer. [Edit: September 29, 2012] Anyone else notice that they seem different?? The last couple packs we bought were dryer and brittle. They also weren't as potent as the other ones were. He doesn't seem to like them as much any more.

 NOT ORGANIC!,1,"From Manitoba Harvest: Cross contamination can occur in pesticide free (non organic grown seed) as wind blow or sharing of trucks, equipment or storage bins can occur. For peace of mind buy certified organic as farmers pay attention to detail, don't share equipment or bins, and are monitored strictly so they are paid a higher prices per pound. There's a difference in what kind of fertilizer is used on the land. Our organic seeds come from certified organic land which uses alfalfa as fertilizer, while our pesticide-free seed farmers have the option of using a synthetic topical on the soil, very much the same as liquid plant food you can buy for your house. This synthetic topical is man-made and not organic, which is why our Pesticide-Free product line cannot be certified organic. Also the tubs are gigantic which makes storing a pain. I've gotten a couple of tubs that needed to be cut open because it wasn't perforated and they couldn't be resealed which also was a problem because the product couldn't stay fresh. They need to stick with the resealable bags and jars rather than these tubs. Cheap is not always worth it that's for sure. I'll stick to true organic in bags that take up little space. …",5 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 What is the seller smoking?,1,"Lays Dill Pickle potato chips are delicious. I would recommend that anyone who likes a tangy chip give this brand a try, as other brands I've tried don't have a good balance of acidity and saltiness and can therefore totally overwhelm the palate. HOWEVER, Lays Dill Pickle potato chips are NOT so delicious that anyone should be paying $21.98 (including shipping) for JUST ONE bag of them. You can purchase the same-sized package of these at a brick-and-mortar grocery store for $3-4 with sales tax.

" Ok, it's not peanut butter... but they tried",3,"I love PB and can't eat it at all during my cutting phases because I tend to eat way too much of it and go over my calorie and fat limit for the day. (It's great for getting the correct ratio of healthy fats into your diet for bulking phases though!) I've tried other PB substitues like Better 'N Peanut Butter and PB2(PB2 is a powdered peanut butter mix with about 1/4 the calories and fat of regular PB, and it tastes just like the normal stuff) and they are not bad. But I still can't eat as much of it as I want. As soon as I saw this, my first thought was ""SWEET!!! THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE GOOD!"" I read some reviews, thought for 25 seconds, ordered 3 jars, and didn't really have too high of expectations since it is a calorie free product. Well, it kind of tastes like roasted peanuts... kind of. I'd say it's more of a fake sugar/bitter coffee/peanut flavored pudding product. If you can imagine the aftertaste you get from the fake sugar in diet coke, you can kind of imagine this. It's not a total failure though, because I am still going to use this, but not by itself. I tried mixing a few tablespoons of this with a tablespoon of regular creamy PB and a little bit of PB2 powder. The normal PB enhances the peanut taste where this stuff left off, and the PB2 gives it the right texture. After all that, it's really not bad. I'd even say pretty good. Regular PB has about 100 calories per tablespoon and a ton of fat. This mixed PB concoction has maybe 25 calories per tablespoon. Not bad. The walden farms grape jelly is great, and does taste like real jelly. And I'll use it with the peanut butter mix on light wheat bread, and you have a fairly good 200 calorie PB&J sandwich (that's 1/4 the calories and fat of a normal PB&J). …",86 out of 93 users found this review helpful

 Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor,4,"To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes. NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words ""Medium Extra Bold"" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Superstore should correct that description and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other. …",454 out of 462 users found this review helpful

 My personal fave,5,"My husband gave me a Keurig coffee maker, so we've been trying different flavors of coffee. To me, I don't care about brand necessarily, I just like flavored coffee. On the top of my list are Gloria Jean's assorted flavors (Hazelnut, French Vanilla, White Chocolate -- I think). That one also includes a Mudslide flavor, but we thought it had a slight coconut taste we didn't care for. I like the Kahlua brand Kahlua coffee, but the flavor portion is a little strong. But my VERY, VERY, VERY favorite flavor is this Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle flavor. It's just the right balance of ""coffee"" to ""flavor"" ratio. You can taste it, but still taste the coffee. And my kitchen smells heavenly! But a lot of it boils down to personal taste and preferences. If you typically like this type of flavored coffee, you will love this flavor. And I definitely recommend Subscribe and Save for K-cups if you have a Keurig. It's the most economical way to get them. You get a discount and free shipping. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" IF you like this, just try tasty east Soy Jerky",1,"First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And, we found out it has granulated garlic, possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to ""spices"".

Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available. Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them.

 I highly recommend this Sumatra Dark Roast,5,"I just recieved this coffee and I have brewed about 20 cups of coffee so far. I use a burr grinder and a very nice Starbucks drip coffee maker. In fact, I am enjoying a cup of the cofffe right now after dragging my lazy behind out of bed at 9am&lt;g>. I am very pleased with this roast. The beans arrived fresh and well packed with a valve on the heavy poly bag. The beans are of a uniform roast with a nice oily sheen throughout. There is no chaff mixed in with the beans. I do some home roasting of my own beans so I have an idea of what the process is and I can state confidently that these are well roasted, cleaned of chaff and that the roast is in fact a dark roast. The coffee tastes just as I like it, a full rich flavor without that acidic slightly burned flavor of a French roast. The taste is very smooth and rich, the main traits that attracted me to Starbucks coffee, craft roasters and eventually home roasting. I get free shipping from Superstore and I bought this on their subscription program, so it cost me $31 plus tax. I think this is a very good price and I would gladly make this roast my daily brew. I recommend this roast without reservation. -Mike …",22 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 Fantastic!,5,"I'm thrilled with this extract. I ordered it on a Tuesday night and had it by Friday afternoon. It came wrapped nicely in plenty of bubble wrap and tissue paper and was accompanied by a nice little note from the seller thanking me for my order. It smells wonderful. It smells just like cocoa powder, and I use it in all my baked goods and even savory foods. Added to gravy it gives it that little something extra, and it's phenomenal in whipped cream, cookies, brownies, sweetbreads, cakes, even coffee and hot chocolate.

 Misleading product name,2,"This product may indeed be delicious but the product name is at the very least misleading, at worst deceptive. Anyone with celiac disease or other wheat intolerance needs to know that this product, though free of wheat, is made with multiple grains, including barley flour, and so is unsuitable for their use. Rightfully, the product should be named Multigrain Fig Bars as that is what they are. I don't see why anyone would specifically choose a wheat-free product over one containing wheat unless one is wheat intolerant (and therefore intolerant to all wheat-related grains). What possible legitimate reason could there be then to name this product ""Wheat Free""? My rating of the product is based not on the product per se but on the unfortunate and misleading name Barbara's Bakery has chosen to give it. Please note also that a representative of Barbara's Bakery in a private communication to me in response to my objection to the name of this product stated there was no claim made that the product was gluten free then added that the few products Barbara's Bakery makes which it does claim to be gluten free are made in non-dedicated facilities which also process wheat. This is absurd as those products are subject to contamination with wheat and cannot legitimately be considered gluten free. It all comes down to a matter of truth in advertising.

 FYI- BEFORE YOU BUY Miracle Noodles PLEASE READ THIS!,1,"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: [...]. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ ""Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all!

 If you prefer a smooth cup of coffee,5,"I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Superstore. I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee. They brew with a nice aroma and color. I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength. Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer. I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion. The taste is mellow and very smooth. I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless. This is simply not the case. I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts. If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these. Also, if you prefer to ""double brew"" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed. These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed. Finally I have to say that Superstore is the best place to buy these. They have the best prices and fast shipping.

 Sodium Benzoate is Dangerous- It's in EZ sweetz,1,"I was disappointed to find out EZ-sweet uses Sodium Benzoate as one of it's preservatives. This ingredient, when combined with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) creates Benzene which is carcinogenic (cancer causing). I used to use Splenda or generic sucralose packets, but they made a mess on the counter, took up too much room in our pantry when purchased in bulk, and took up alot of space near the coffee maker when compared with concentrated sweeteners. EZ sweet would be the easy alternative if it weren't toxic. I had to find a better option. I find that the only super easy way around using EZ sweet but also save on space/mess is to use the splenda mini tablets. They are pricey and will cost a lot more than the packets, so I've recently found another option. I can now purchase 1 oz of pure sucralose powder form from the Splendex site and mix it with 3 oz of water to make the equivalent of 2,500 packets of Splenda. The cost of the 1oz powder is only $24.95. I found that other companies sell sucralose powder and if you buy a lot of it, it's even cheaper. I don't know how I would measure out 1oz to make a 4 oz bottle of sweetener solution so, for me, it's just easier to get 1oz, it will last us a while and the 4oz bottle on the coffee counter doesn't take up much space at all. I'm going to experiment with different natural preservatives (colloidal silver, GSE, natural salts, citric acid) to keep the solution from becoming contaminated with bacteria or fungus. If you're going to go this route, do some research on natural preservatives and if you find one you love, please leave a comment to this review. Note: I was lucky that the splendex company agreed to give me a 4oz bottle to use for my sucralose solution, I'm not sure if they would do that for everyone. If not, just keep your old EZ squeeze bottle or find a nice dropper bottle that will do the job without making a mess. Oh and finding the powder wasn't easy. It is not an option on their home/default web page. I had to go to order products and on the right side was an option for the powder. …",4 out of 26 users found this review helpful

It's a shame because it's the perfect snack.

" Ingredients not detailed in description. ""Ingredients: Inulin soluble fiber, Sweetleaf Sweetener.""",1,"The first thing I did was check the ingredients because of all the different sweeteners that claim to be Stevia but have fillers of some sort. I had chosen this brand because it's all natural, no chemicals, but unlike other pure Stevia sweeteners that I've tried, that have Stevia as the Main ingredient and Xylitol(to help with the caking) i.e ""Ingredients: Stevia, Xylitol"" this one reads, ""Ingredients: Inulin soluble fiber, Sweetleaf Sweetener."" I was disappointed and thought you might want to know if you're looking for a real all Stevia sweetener. Superstore does not give refunds on grocery items, though they were gracious on this occassion to give one. I don't know about the taste, my main concern was that it was actually Stevia and then I can look into taste afterwards. One more thing, the description on the bottle label attributes digestive health to the inulin fiber not the stevia. …",7 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Way too sweet...,2,"Overall, this mix is okay, but, the sugar content is very, very high. You can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely. For pancakes or waffles, this is fine, but for savory concoctions, this is not acceptable. Sausage ****, casseroles, and biscuits all come out almost inedible.This mix is also oddly gritty. The grit is very fine, but still makes my teeth want to curl. I recommend Pamela's baking and pancake mix, as it is smoother, and much more versatile, because it's not as sweet. A good cook knows you can always add more of something, but you can't take it out if you've added too much. That being said, if you're traveling and this is the only mix they have, it's better than nothing. …",18 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 Man mauled by pack of wolves...,1,"I am writing this review from the hospital... A couple of weeks ago I ordered the ""Whole Rabbit"" from Superstore in hopes of having my wife cook it up nice and good. The problem started when I opened the box. Of course I had been wearing my 3 Wolf Moon T-shirt for about 3 weeks (Still had another week before it needed to be washed) and the pack was hungry. They proceeded to claw and bite at the Whole Rabbit. I was an innocent bystander as the wolves mauled at my own torso trying to get to that waskally wabbit torso I held in my hands. There was no way I wanted to give it up as my wife has a great recipe she found on Superstore. The ingredients, to name a few, are; Tuscan Milk (naturally), Uranium Ore, and Twinkies. Anyways, the Whole Rabbit never got cooked, I ended up with scars about the head, neck, chest, back, stomach, and face. But worst of all, my beloved 3WM t-shirt is in utter ruins (at least they got fed). I can't afford to buy another one because of all the hospital bills, does anyone want to donate a 3WM to me? I will never buy rabbit from the internet again, I will stick to the live ones at the pet shop.

 DO NOT PURCHASE THESE STRIPS IF YOU WISH TO KEEP YOUR DOG ALIVE!!!,1,"BUYER BEWARE! This caused severe intestinal bleeding and an inflamed stomach lining in two of my toy poodles who had to be taken emergency, to my nearest animal hospital! The vet bill cost me $1,200 for a $25 6 pack of death strips! I have the remaining 5 packs that are sealed and was going to return them to Superstore, but they don't accept edibles.. I always buy Mellow Mut and wanted to give these a try. I don't know what possessed me to switch, but I'm so sorry I did!!! They seemed a bit rough, like an old piece of leather, very coarse, not the usual kind of texture my dogs have been used to. I didn't think much of it at first, because they eat these types of treats all the time and they are supposed to be the ''nautral choice'' only healthful, not harmful! But, I never knew the damage they would cost my dogs. They began to become very listless after digestion, severe **** vomit and explosive, watery diarrhea with blood followed, almost to the point of shock!!! I just got home from a long night at the hospital with them and they are in a very delicate state and still not in the clear. I have to return with them if the vomiting continues for futher investagation! I don't know what to expect in the next couple of hours! They are on very strong medications and must follow a very bland diet for three weeks that is, if no more complications arise! I pray my babies make a full recovery! I urged Superstore to pull these off the website, before this tragedy occurs with another innocent life! They are poison for dogs, maybe this batch was just the contaminated one? Either way, you don't want to take that chance with your beloved pooch! Please stay away! I don't even care if I lost my money on this order, you can't put a price on your best friend! I just want everyone's dogs to be safe! Vitality brand dog strips are toxic!!!! P.S.

 Review on TASTE,5,"I'm writing this review, because it's exactly the kind of review I was looking for before I bought this product, but could not find anywhere. When I first started using Natural Calm I bought it in the Raspberry-Lemon flavor, thinking it sounded the best and used it with water (usually just put it inside a water bottle and shook it up to mix it and drank it that way). Both me and my husband used it and HE really liked the taste, but for me this stuff tasted BAD. I don't know why, but I did not like the taste at all. I guess some people do (obviously my husband did or at least didn't mind it) but I definitely did not. It made drinking it everyday a CHORE. So, this next time I decided to try the one that isn't flavored and I like it SO MUCH better, like a million times better. I just mix it in with my blueberry-pomegranate juice and it's great! It is virtually tasteless and just adds a little 'fizz' to the juice that I actually LIKE. I also put it in teas as well. I wanted to write this review just to let people know that not everyone loves the raspberry-leomon flavor (and I didn't think I'd like the orange to begin with, but haven't tried it yet and probably never will). There are a lot of reviews claiming it tastes great... but for me not so much. I recommend the flavor-less one. Also, be careful when starting out to use the recommendation on the bottle and start with 1/2 a teaspoon a day and then work up from there. :-) I never had any negative side effects, but I guess some people get diarrhia if they take too much in the beginning. This stuff really is amazing and will help you feel GREAT! :-) If you're thinking about trying it don't hesitate. It has many, many benefits. You might just be using it to help with mood or to help with ADHD/concentration, or just for a natural way to keep from becoming constipated... There are MANY benefits. But no matter what you're using it for, it's bound to help out your body and mood in other ways as well! :-) Can't say enough good things about this product! Just try to get the flavor-less one first, it's so much better!! I hated having to drink it when we had the raspberry-lemon one. But now I definitely don't, and like the little fizz it gives my blueberry-pomegranate juice & teas! :-) Drinking it right now and loving it! And loving the way it makes me feel and the concentration it gives me! …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful

" These are awesome, fatty, and flavorful.",4,"These little pretzel pieces are totally addictive, which is probably not a good thing because they're a lot worse for you than you'd think pretzels should be. They have around 60 fat calories and 3 grams of saturated fat in ONE ounce, which equals out to be 15% of your daily sat fat intake per serving (one ounce). The reason they're so good AND so fatty is that the mustard/onion seasoning is in an oil that permeates through the shell of the pretzel, making them extra flavorful and not dry at all. They're a little sweet, have good mustard flavor, and the onion flavor even comes through a little (they taste like they're supposed to). I try to just grab a handful at snack time and quit while I'm ahead, but I usually end up going back for more later. If you're willing to put up with a little extra fat for a lot of extra flavor, these are a perfect snack. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on. I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt.

As for the other reviewers, they are entitled to their opinions, but I need to throw out a bit of education: The reason that these Sardines are not processed in the United States is because THERE ARE NO MORE SARDINE processors in the United States. The last one was in Maine and it closed down in 2010 - this was big news already. The reasons for this are multiple: California's Sardine processing crashed after overfishing of California Sardines ruined the industry in CA for a while. The cost of buying American processed Sardines was too high of a price for Americans, who simply opted to buy the stuff processed in Morocco and Portugal. Blaming this particular company for sending off the fish to Vietnam is misplaced criticism. Blame yourselves for not buying American to save money only to complain about it later.

 Wonderful Starter,5,"LATEST REMARKS: A couple of times I had milk that was getting a little old so I scalded it first by bringing it to 185º and holding it there 5 minutes. It's definitely a nuisance but I noticed both times that the yogurt set up much firmer. I am still incubating in a cooler and am happy with the system. I usually incubate for 8 hours overnight and no longer add hot water halfway through. Always looking for the easiest way. It turns out fine every time. Still love the taste and convenience of this starter. Still just using half the recommended amount of starter. My batch of yogurt is actually 5 and a half cups rather than a quart. I use great old heavy glass jars similar to big peanut butter jars. I've never bothered to measure it before, till another reviewer made an issue of the cost effectiveness of making homemade yogurt. So the cost per ""quart"" for me is even less than the 97¢ plus electricity I mentioned in my comments to ""Are You Kidding?"". ORIGINAL REVIEW: I love this starter. It's very convenient to have on hand since I live in a very rural area, and I think the taste is great. I get firm yogurt in my Salton in only 5 hours and I don't think it's anywhere near too tart. I find the flavor to be very pleasant when I lick the spoon. I eat my yogurt with fruit (no added sugar) and the flavor is not at all overpowering. Yogurt gets more tart when it incubates longer but sometimes I have let a batch go 7 or 8 hours and I still think it tastes fine. Because this starter is so pricey, I use just half of the recommended amount and it works fine. I first used it at the recommended strength for comparison. A half portion is a little less than a teaspoon. Then I tightly reseal the packet till next batch. I also save portions of yogurt for starter. I keep one in the fridge for the next batch, and freeze several. This way, a packet that costs a dollar or more, instead of just making one quart, gives me about ten quarts without too much fuss. On occasion I use second-generation yogurt for starter, but mostly just the first generation. Now that Superstore is now offering a 3-pack of 6-portion boxes for a good price and eligible for Super Saver shipping, this starter has become much more affordable. Some additions/Dec. 13, 2009: My Salton died a premature death. Now I incubate in an insulated six-pack-type cooler, using jars of hot water alongside the jar of yogurt (which sits in the insulated holder from my old Salton). I refill the jars of hot water halfway through. I use the hottest tap water--obviously this is a potential variable--but the jars of water can be a lot hotter than the yogurt if they're not right up against it. It sets up in 6 to 8 hours, flavor still great. I add 1/2 cup dry milk per oversized ""quart"" and still use just half the recommended starter. I use nonfat milk which is notorious for not making real firm yogurt. Mine is totally firm (curd-like or gel-like consistency) for the first serving. After that the whey separates out some. I either eat it or pour it off. It is not as creamy as commercial nonfat yogurt; I don't think that's achievable at home. I use store-bought milk and do not scald it. I warm it to 110 degrees, using a cheap candy thermometer bought right here on Superstore . I believe anywhere from 105 to 112 is OK. I warm everything I'm using ahead of time. I'm glad my tips have been helpful and hope these details might help someone else out. …",57 out of 58 users found this review helpful
 Why can't anyone make a hot cocoa without sucralose/Splenda in it?,3,"I HATE SUCRALOSE. Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising. That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition. Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run). There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find. My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me. So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option. Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere. UPDATE: I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing. UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets. I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself. So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant. 43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon. …",187 out of 216 users found this review helpful

 Don't be fooled into thinking this is a traditional Japanese substitue for dashi.,2,I thought dashi was a soup stock made from fish flakes and kombu. The top two ingredients in this product are Salt and then Monosodium Glutimate. …,15 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 not the real deal!,1,"These tomatoes are domestically grown in CA. To the person who said that they didn't know how anyone can tell where they're from, read the product description written by the manufacturer. It says ""these are domestically grown tomatoes..."", it also says ""grown in California"" right on the label. To the person who said he had tasted them, and referred to another reviewers comments and said that person had not tasted them, please reread the review. He clearly states that he had tasted them. As for me, I have cooked with these many times, because they were on sale at my local Safeway. They are definitely NOT the real deal! They do not look like, nor taste like real San Marzano tomatoes grown in Italy- which I have tasted and cooked with many times. They taste like any other run of the mill American grocery store brand. I agree with the 1st reviewer that their labels are false advertising, and the price they charge on Superstore is highway robbery! $4.50 + shipping- ouch! I paid about $1 per 28 oz. can (on sale) at my local market. Save your time and money- if you are looking for the real deal, this is not it. There are websites that sell nothing but real Italian products, grown in Italy, and stamped with the official Italian DOP seal. Nancy …",13 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Great Product - Slight gag reflex  ;-),5,"This product is great...but...for all of you that have praised its ""great flavor"" and ""smooth texture"", all I can say is, you MUST be some kind of hard-core health food junkies!!! I gag every time I drink this stuff. I have tried mixing it with OJ, apple juice, flavored yogurts, etc and I STILL can't get used to the taste and texture. Now, mind you, I usually only eat my greens with bacon & hot sauce so that may be the culprit as to why I have trouble with this. All that being said, for those of us that are trying to live a healthier lifestyle, this product is really amazing. I have loads more energy and I just plain feel better every day. I just HAD to comment in case any other heath food newbies or light-weights out there were feeling the same. Please Note: do not let this discourage you from purchasing this, you might gag like me but it is TOTALLY WORTH IT!!! …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWERS YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA,5,"IN A NUTSHELL: VERY GOOD TASTING ""REAL BREWER'S YEAST"" -- NOTHING ADDED This ""Genuine Brewer's Yeast"" powder tastes very good for real Brewers Yeast. Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.

BOTTOM LINE: GREAT PRODUCT -- EXCELLENT PRICE I usually shop this item for the best price as it is handled by all the large vendors that sell via Superstore including Swanson's. Interestingly, the larger vendors tend to have fresher product, and this is evidenced by the expiration date on the jar which typically gives you about 2 years on these vacuum sealed containers. THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWERS YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA PLEASE NOTE: [WE AND I ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE SALE OR PROMOTION OF THIS OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT -- I SIMPLY BELIEVE IN BREWER'S YEAST AND THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF ABOUT 4 BRANDS THAT I HAVE ALWAYS PURCHASED FOR OUR PERSONAL CONSUMPTION OVER THE YEARS] …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Love it!,5,"I love this noodle soup! This is one of the few varieties out there that are not spicy. You might pay a bit more, but the larger size totally makes up for it. It seems to be out of stock a lot, and this makes me worried. I am on the Subscribe and Save plan for monthly delivery. I hope Superstore or the manufacturer does not decide to discontinue it. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful
