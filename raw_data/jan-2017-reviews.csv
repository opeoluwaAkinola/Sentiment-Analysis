 Fluoridated salt,1,"I thought this salt was fluoride free unfortunately it is fluoridated, avoid paying extra. [...]. (Over the last few years a new scam has emerged in Europe which is rapidly spreading across the world. It involves ordinary rock salt from the ""salt range"" in Pakistan being marketed as luxurious and healing ""Himalaya Salt"". It is also sold as ""Himalayan Crystal Salt"", ""Hunza-Kristallsalz"" or natural ""Kristallsalz"", ""VitaSal"", ""AromaLife"", etc.. The scam is currently being introduced in India and the United States. It will result in very high overall fluoride intake in anyone who follows the various ""therapy recommendations"") also noted from above website. …",17 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 K Cups don't work right,1,"Like so many other reviews, I must add my displeasure to the list. The cups are certainly not what I am used to using and I have used just about every brand out there. Mine either fall apart or don't brew. I don't recommend them at any price. UPDATE: After leaving the above review, the company rep made a big deal out of working on things to fix this issue and most importantly promised to fulfil replacement of the bad cups. It has been a month now for those replacement cups, doubt I will ever see them. No response to emails either. I still stand on what I said, ""I don't recommend them at any price."" …",7 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Great dog food for dogs with digestive problems,5,"I originally bought this as a replacement for Science Diet's I/D as it was always much more expensive than anything else out there. I/D was also more expensive than Newman's at my local vet's office. I have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past. We tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. We found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her Milkbone treats. We needed something organic without a lot of beef in it. While this one does have some bi-product for protein, it doesn't seem to bother my dog at all. She also has normal stools every time which wasn't the case even with the I/D. My dog hated the I/D. She would often leave a good portion of it on the ground or in the bowl and rarely ate it in its entirety. With the Newman's own it is night and day. She scarfs it down in less than a couple minutes and usually eats a bowl in one sitting. It seems like she loves it from the way she eats it. A couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem I had with other dog foods. I gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now. My husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems with. On a side note, I wish Newman's offered a bigger size bag. I have to order these all the time due to the 12.5 pound bag. My husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size. It still works out being cheaper than the $50 bag of 17 pound I/D I was ordering so I'm still happy with it. Science diet was sending me to the poor house. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 phenomenal taste,4,"I've been brewing coffee manually for many years, using a plastic cone filter holder. I recently switched to this porcelain filter holder, and it really brings out a huge improvement in the taste. The porcelain conducts the heat better and eliminates any kind of plastic taste. With the cap on, the coffee stays warm for about an hour. Two complaints: the #4 paper filters are a bit too small; you can actually use a #6 filter. Also, there is only one hole in the filter holder, so brewing can be a bit slow sometimes, and when I do try to rush things, there is sometimes clogging which requires my adjusting the filter a bit. But this porcelain filter holder does produce the best coffee I've ever had at home, a coffeehouse, or a restaurant. With coffee, lo-tech and slow-brewed is always the best way to go. …",39 out of 40 users found this review helpful

 Almost as good as Mccann's,5,"I love irish oats. This style of oats is simply the best bowl of cereal period. I eat at least one bowl everyday. That said, all steel cut oats are NOT the same. As many people know, there is no comparison to the taste of Mccann's Irish oats. Why are they better? Honestly, I don't know. Maybe because they're Irish. Anyway, I have previously tried other types of steel cut oats and quite honestly, they were no comparison. Well one day recently, when I was shopping and realized that I was out of Mccann's, I found that my grocery store was out. Right next to the spot was this brand of oats. I had tried the Country Choice Rolled Oat and Multigrain cereals, and they are both great. So I figured I'd give it a try. They are very, very good. These are as close to Mccann's as you can get. Since they are about half the price of Mccann's, I figure i will switch between these two. In summary, these are a great choice if you can't get Mccann's or if you prefer a cheaper breakfast. …",36 out of 37 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Nutrition considerations if depend on large amounts of hemp,5,"Despite claims to the contrary, hemp protein is not a complete protein. It is very weak in lysine, and doesn't have enough leucine and tryptophan. Because of this, if you eat it in large quantities, especially in a vegetarian diet, it cannot count gram for gram. That is not to say it is not a very positive element of a well balanced diet in reasonable diet proportions or when complementary proteins balance the weaknesses. One tip: Protein from almonds and almond milk are also just as incomplete in lysine. Hemp seed protein has all essential amino acids - just not in the optimal proportions. You'd be hard pressed to find any protein that was nearly devoid of even one of them (ok, gelatin is a rare contender). ... it is good to separate the hype in the marketing of nutritional supplements and then to enjoy it for what it offers ;-) According to the amino acid data Nutiva, this manufacturer of this natural hemp 50% protein powder, provides on THEIR website - put in terms of proportions of each of the essential amino acids per actual gram of the hemp protein, this is NOT complete protein by definition. The standard ""complete protein"" definition you can find on Wikipedia defined, or on the Self (Nutrition) site is, in mg per gram overall protein: Tryptophan................7 Threonine................27 Isoleucine...............25 Leucine..................55 Lysine...................51 Methionine+Cystine.......25 Phenylalanine+Tyrosine...47 Valine...................32 Histidine................18 Hemp: Lysine is only 27/51: incomplete. If you look at the essential aa's stated on the Nutiva website and compared them to the definition of a complete protein above you will notably find less than 55% of the complete proportion of lysine. Tryptophan and BCAA leucine are also coming up short: three of the nine essential amino acids are thus lacking vs. a ""complete protein"". That gives hemp seed protein quality score of under 55 when a complete protein needs to be 100 or more. Normally protein quality is nothing to worry about since randomly several sources are combined and usually work out well. But some people seem to really push their protein intake very high for bulking up, etc., and others, usually not healthy are trying to supplement their needs to meet their numbers. In both of those cases protein quality will make or break their strategy. That is not to say they need to have complete proteins each time they eat: Only; they need to approximate optimal human essential amino acid proportions basically over a day or so. The bioavailability of hemp protein is decent - somewhere around 80% bioavailability - typical for veggies which presents a challenge. Compared to milk, egg or chicken, for example, these score in the high 90's for bioavailability in digestion (flavor and whether it agrees with you are different concepts). In perspective, and unfortunately, that makes hemp's protein quality worse than the approximate 55 ... All the above said hemp can be GREAT if balanced properly in the diet! You just need to quantify what you are getting and tailor it to your needs, when you use the supplements as a major portion of your diet. SUGGESTION: The bottom line is if you are in need of protein supplementation, be careful with counting on large amounts of hemp if you haven't complemented the relatively ""low protein quality"" with other ""low quality"" or otherwise complementary proteins (don't get misled by the use of the word quality ... all protein is good ... we are just looking to meet optimal human requirements and that is where the misnomer 'quality' is being applied). To get the correct mix for optimal diet needs... it would be critical to add at some point in the day, (this works) 100g of frozen spinach and a cob of corn or its equivalent in kernels to get the additional lysine and tryptophan per serving of hemp - it would be a reasonable vegetable source if you go the vegetarian route. Alternately, adding a reasonable amount of yogurt for its protein content works fine, and if you eat fish, cod is one of the best complements to hemp as it has a lysine score of about 180 vs. hemp's 55. ""Eat a well balanced diet"". Yogurt or whey protein in your diet will take care of that - combining it with hemp protein content 1:1; soy somewhat if you are vegan - but be careful of not overdoing it for your thyroid hormone with soy since that is controversial and certainly for people who have low thyroid hormone levels... find soy extracted with alcohol if this is the case since the hormones in soy (which many tout as 'good') are diminished during the alcohol extraction. Soy is great in moderation and offers better ""quality"" than hemp if you look at it alone, but properly part of a balanced diet, neither is better than the other. Believe it or not, eating too much protein can be a problem, too if you get supplemented out. This applies especially if the amino acid profile is not a good match for optimal nutrition conveniently found in meat, dairy and soy proteins (which are close to optimal individually eaten). Excess amino acids in a diet are disposed of by putting the liver to work. In extreme cases (somewhere over 1.2 grams protein per pound of body weight depending on the strength of your liver), you will get a yellower urine even when you drink lots. That is basically the nitrogen byproduct after the body burns and stores the protein it cannot use. So, if you eat an average protein quality of 55 and get your daily grams, you will actually only get let's estimate something of the order of 55% of that protein incorporated into you (ok, there is a bit more to it depending on the non-essentials, but this is the general idea) and the rest will be dumped into your liver, excreted nitrogen and the rest converted into energy or stored as glycogen or fat - there is no memory or ""protein reserve"" in the body. The excretion part will be in the form of urea. Too much urea in the urine puts you at risk for gout a disease you don't want to know about. All these consideration are for extreme cases. In healthy cases where hemp is part of a balanced diet it is a non-issue. So, best to eat a serving of spinach and cob of corn with a 30 gram serving of this hemp, beans and Swiss chard would be helpful, but really a well balanced diet including dairy is the healthy low risk situation keeping a general eye on fats but no dwelling on it to the point of worrying about gaining an ounce of weight every now and then ... that's why we need to exercise. Alternately you can spend a mint on amino acid supplement pills to raise the hemp to a ""higher"" quality protein than soy or whey for that matter ... People who are immobile have other issues and the bioavailability, supplementation and protein quality can become major issues for them. Like to preventing skin breakdown and bed sores to start with. Depends on your situation. …",205 out of 229 users found this review helpful
 #1 Superfood,5,"Nutritional benefits of Chia seeds are amazing. Here are a few to start: *According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids. *The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein. *Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy. *Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health. *Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk. *Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana. *Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia seeds, it also tastes very good. My girlfriend and I make a big pot of ""steel cut"" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of Chia seeds, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it. Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions. There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite. I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days. One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven't put in 500 miles. But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon! Could the chia seeds have helped? I think so. I certainly had more energy and my joints felt better my second attempt at a marathon when ""on"" the chia. I started out paying an arm-and-a-leg at Whole Foods for Chia seeds, but have since started buying them on Superstore for a fraction of the price. Buy some Chia seeds and make a delicious bowl of oatmeal for one of the healthiest breakfasts possible. …",57 out of 58 users found this review helpful

" Quality Product, Not Suited For My Taste Buds",3,"I've been eating Annie's Mac n' Cheese (not the whole wheat type) since 1994. Superstore offers a excellent price (around $1.50 per box for certified organic, whoa!) and if I'm going to commit upfront to 12 boxes of mac and cheese, I figured I try to be a little healthier and get the whole wheat type. It is a quality product but it isn't suited to my taste buds. I am surprised because I prefer brown rice and wild rice to white rice and generally enjoy whole wheat products. But to this eater, the whole wheat shells were too heavy and chewy. The watery white cheddar sauce enhanced the pasta's rougher texture and blandness. (The white cheddar sauce is like an alfredo, and less creamy than Annie's regular cheddar.) My friends love this stuff, but I think it's an acquired tasted. If I had known what I know now, I'd have stuck with the enriched white (yet stripped of it's nutrients) shells or at least gone with the regular cheddar sauce. *Update* While still not a full-on fan, I enjoying this product more now that: 1. Tastes much better when cooked 10-11 minutes at sea-level (the box recommends 8-10), the texture is less rough and gummy and is more noodle-y. 2. Adding fresh herbs with the cheese sauce. It gives a depth to the flavor. My favorite herb to add (so far) is cilantro (add about 1/3 cup chopped after mixing in the cheese sauce). Other enjoyable variations were adding 2/3 cup of Italian parsley or 1/8 cup fresh dill leaves. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 The best sun tea .... ever,5,"During the summer months, I enjoy iced tea and prefer to make sun tea because it's so darn simple & energy-efficient. But finding tea that does well in the sun is difficult. The regular teas (black, green, white) become bitter when left standing too long, not surprisingly a requirement for sun tea. The herbals (fruits, chamomiles, mints) never seem to steep well in the sun and are generally bland & lack-luster. But this tea ... ah, heaven. Deep, robust, sweet, well-rounded. Personally, I think it is better as a sun tea than steeped the traditional way with hot water. This tea steeps well in morning or afternoon sun. I always use glass (never plastic) and 6 bags for about 1.5 quarts. Makes a fantastic tea in 3-4 hours, and letting it sit for a couple more hours produces a tea that definitely needs to be watered down. Needs no sugar, no lemon. Perfect as is. Awesome, just awesome. I wouldn't go a summer without it. I pick it up at Trader Joe's, and occassionally I find it at Target and Wal-mart.

At the outset of my ACV ""diet"" I was a pretty healthy 6'2"" 210 pound 29 year-old guy with a decent spare tire around my waist. I was enjoying life a little too much and exercising too little. I started taking ACV for heartburn. I enjoy cooking so I had a bottle of it in my kitchen already. After experiencing the instant and amazing relief (and energy boost), I did a bit of research and found out that it cures a laundry list of other ailments. It sounded too good to be true, so my skeptical self decided to give it the old college try for a month. I continued taking it and noticed within days that I was sleeping better, eating better and generally had more energy. After a few weeks, my wife noticed that I had lost weight, and I shocked myself one day when I caught myself in a full-length mirror. I was getting my skinny college body back! And this without any exercise or apparent change in diet. I was doing nothing different except for the addition of ACV to my diet. Energy levels. This is the first thing you'll notice as the ACV hits your stomach. Almost instantly, you get a natural boost that lasts for hours. Any desire to eat unhealthy food fades. I've read that this is a result of the normalizing effect it has on blood sugar. This is also related to the weight loss people experience while taking it. The high energy levels given by ACV is my new normal. Addiction. Before taking ACV, I was drinking far too much alcohol and caffeine. A pot of coffee was my mainstay during the day and a bottle of wine was easy to finish after dinner. A few years ago I was getting heart palpitations from drinking too much caffeine so I quit cold turkey, but my usage was creeping back up again. Fast forward to after eight months on Braggs--I drink one glass of coffee per day (maybe two) and am lucky if I can finish a bottle of wine or a few heavy beers. My stomach just says ENOUGH. Oh, and no heart palpitations since! Sleep. I was a sleepwalker as a child. I never grew out of it. As an adult, I still sleepwalk and in addition suffer from insomnia and sleep paralysis (where you wake up, can't move and believe something is in the room with you--not fun). Before ACV I'd get sleep paralysis a few times per week and sleepwalk a few times per month. I needed 9-10 hours of sleep per night to feel rested. After ACV I fall asleep easier, RARELY get sleep paralysis and don't sleepwalk anymore. I wake up feeling refreshed after 7-8 hours. Weight loss. While not a magical fat-burning elixir, it will control your blood sugar and cravings, resulting in a slow weight loss over time. My ""spare tire"" is nearly gone and some of my pants are looking big on me. I'm continuing to lose weight slowly, and family and friends who only see me a few times per year always remark how thin I'm getting. ACV also gets rid of water bloat, which will have the visual effect of weight loss right away. Take it before going out to Macaroni Grill to prevent feeling like a lumbering dinosaur afterwards. Now that the weather is warmer I've started jogging and this magnifies the weight loss even more, and a shot beforehand always ensures a great workout with high energy levels. Skin. I never had a problem with acne before so I can't comment on its use for that. I did break out with some psoriasis on my nose recently, and I thought it was just dry skin. But it didn't go away after a month and was getting worse. I applied ACV directly with a Q-tip for a couple weeks and PRESTO it was gone. Amazing! Digestion. If you suffer from heart burn or acid reflux (I had both!) ACV works wonders. It also calms the stomach after a large meal and eliminates bloating and hangovers. It acts as a ""cleanser"" of sorts, so don't stray too far from the bathroom the first few times you take it. You'll be amazed at what comes out. On second thought, no you won't. Just flush. Immune system. I had a pretty strong one before starting the Braggs diet, however I still found myself getting sick a couple times per year, whether it was something nasty like the flu, a sinus infection or simply a cold brought on by stress. Guess what? I haven't been sick in eight months. Not even a sniffle. If I ever get sick again, I will be surprised. Here are a couple pointers. If you can't stand the taste, mix it with honey or juice. Or just man up and shoot it like a tequila shot (after awhile you'll get used to it). Now I simply drink it straight and instantly chase it with a big glass of water. I shoot it back so it doesn't touch my teeth and swish my mouth with the water. If you do it right it doesn't burn. Just think of it as really tart apple cider. If you're going to wuss out of taking ACV because of the taste, you're doing yourself a disservice and missing out on a lot of health benefits. Apple cider vinegar does AMAZING things to every bodily system. I don't know how it works, but it works. I was a believer after days and will remain one for years. Now I know why doctors and the medical establishment scoff at ACV--if everyone took it they'd be out of a job! Do your body a favor and start your own Braggs experiment! …",321 out of 322 users found this review helpful
 Another excellent entree!,5,"Last night my family tried the Patak Tikka Masala sauce. Boy, that was good! Tonight, we tried the Patak Tandoori Paste-- and, yes, that was good, too! The paste is very easy to use. I used boneless skinless chicken breast. I mixed 8 -10 tbsp of this paste with 6-7 tbsps of plain yogurt and marinated for several hours. Then, I baked the chicken for about 1/2 hour and it's done! It's rare when I serve a meal that everyone in my family likes, but I've now served 2 meals in a row that everyone in my family raved about! I served this with couscous and a salad. Very quick, easy, and very very good! …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Really good for an instant soup,4,"Like the other reviewers, I initially bought this as a joke but after about 6 months of it sitting around in the kitchen causing mirth, I realized that I could still keep the packet if I opened it carefully and actually try the product. I was amazed and appalled. The former because it's a delicious, highly spicy concoc(k)tion which is far more interesting and flavorful than any of the domestic packet soups I've tried (and I've tried most). The latter because I realized right then and there that I would have to continue to avail myself of a product that's very difficult to find and inspires derision and hilarity when friends spot it. On the downside, it *is* extremely salty, I use about 125% of the water it suggests and you have to be careful it doesn't simmer down too far. It is very, very tasty though. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Read this article first,2,"I thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby. That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...] Needless to say I'm switching to another brand. From the article: Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas. No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity. …",43 out of 59 users found this review helpful

 A major improvement in menopausal symptoms,5,"I tried this product after researching menopausal heart palpitations and internal tremors on www.power-surge . The relief was immediate! What surprised me was the improvement in many other aspects of my health. No more headaches that feel like a tight cap binding my scalp. Reduction of my migraines. No more nightmares (brought on by hormone fluctuations). No more ""internal earthquakes"" or buggy-crawling sensations on my skin. Less anxiety (formerly triggered by hormonal changes). No more weak nails. Monthly acid reflux greatly reduced, sometimes none at all. Greatly reduced frequency of colds, flus and sinusitus. I chose the Calm with Calcium since I am dairy allergic. My body assimilates it well, much better than calcium & magnesium pills, which had little to no effect on the above-mentioned problems (in ANY ratio). Overall, I feel much calmer & more energetic. Not a cure-all, but definitely has raised the quality of my life. I highly recommend this product! …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Excellent Source of Magnesium,5,"If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too. I've also tried a flavored version of this product (Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder). Unlike that version, this stuff is entirely odorless, and the only taste is a sense of tartness. I much prefer this non-flavored version over the flavored version. The only problem I have with this product is that it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage. That's pretty insignificant. So, I still rate it at an Excellent five stars out of five. Highly recommended. Especially if you're taking calcium. …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 Worth every cent--a special treat for yourself or a friend.,5,"Pure Kona coffee, especially when it comes directly from the farm, is everything the coffee lover ever hoped for, absolutely as good as its description suggests it will be. The flavor is rich because farm-processed coffee never has the chance to get stale--the cherries are skinned and the beans are dried and roasted immediately after picking for maximum freshness and mellow flavor. They don't sit around over-fermenting while waiting to be processed (which then requires dark roasting to kill the ""spoiled"" taste). Though pure 100% Kona is rare and difficult to find, this coffee is the real deal--a premier coffee which is among the costliest and most sought-after. If you are just browsing for coffee, take a close look at the label. For some strange reason, coffee can be legally called ""Kona"" if it contains just ten percent Kona beans (with 90% of the beans coming from unknown sources), and some new buyers are unaware of this. This brand of 100% Kona will justify its price and confirm everything you ever wanted in taste. n Mary Whipple …",59 out of 62 users found this review helpful

 Not a factory issued variety pack,3,"I was very excited to see a variety pack offered from larabar. It would allow me to finally sample all the flavors without having to buy boxes of them all since no one my area sells all of these. Much to my suprise, after paying almost $40 for the variety pack (single flavor boxes run between $19 and $25) I realized that the variety pack still has only 16 bars. The same number in the single flavor boxes that run half the price. When my package arrived, it was labelled as a box of blueberry muffin bars, sealed in plastic. I was very upset that I had been sent the wrong variety after paying a significantly higher price to sample them all. So I contacted customer service at Superstore to return them. Since it was a food product, they were unable to offer an exchange or take a return, but they graciously refunded my money. Problem solved by Superstore. So the good and the bad is this...I thought I'd go ahead and try blueberry muffin (because I never had) and hope I liked it since I am now the proud owner of 16 bars. Or so I thought. When I opened the box, I discovered 16 DIFFERENT varieties had been stuffed into the box in different directions and retaped to look like a factor issue box. So I felt like a jerk. Because I honestly thought I had been sent blueberry muffin and Superstore has issued me a refund, so I essentially ended up with a free box of larabars. I logged onto Superstore to let people know that this IS a variety pack, but it will arrive in a single flavor box. That's just how they're packing them. The seller wasn't exactly deceitful, because they never promised this was a factory issued variety pack. However, I feel the sale is misleading. In the long run, I got what I wanted, but was a bit shocked to see that someone had simply purchased 16 flavors and stuffed them back into the boxes. Not very professional. At the time that I'm writing this post, the item is listed as unavailable, so perhaps Superstore has already dropped this purveyor, or they are not going to keep offering it. Either way, if this goes up for sale again, just know what you'll be getting. …",71 out of 76 users found this review helpful
 For My Guests.,5,"I first saw Mexican Coca-Cola at my local warehouse store. What is this, I wondered? Then I read an article about it and the story about how American Coke had been gradually changed and no longer was made with cane sugar. It seems that the U.S. Coke is made with corn syrup. Mexican Coke was said to be like the old-fashioned American Coke I knew and loved as a kid, so it seems. Actually, I preferred Pepsi and you got twice as much for your dime. Well, I just had to try Mexican Coke and I bought a case. It's quite delicious, and is indeed better than the Coca-Cola generally purchased in the U.S. I suppose you could say that it's gourmet Coca-Cola. In any case, I seldom drink anything except diet soft drinks because of a calorie problem I have. However, I have friends, relatives and guests that won't drink diet drinks.

" Marmite, how I love thee",5,"Even if you grow up with Marmite like I did, you either like it or you don't. If you don't care for salty food this is not for you. Marmite has a yeasty, beer-like flavour and a slightly bitter aftertaste, but is a salty flavour explosion in your mouth. If you have a big mouthful it's seriously overwhelming, but spread on toast with cheese it becomes something delicious and thoroughly yummy. I have not been able to convert my American husband yet, although I do have him eating salty black liquorice, so we'll get there eventually. I took a jar of Marmite, some crackers and cheese to work with me and had anybody brave enough taste some. All of my colleagues (Texans, the lot) liked it except for one lady who made a face. She has no tact, so for all I know all the rest secretly hated it but was being polite. If you end up with a jar of Marmite and find yourself to not be a big fan of Marmite on bread, try adding some to soup broth. It's vegetarian friendly, and a nice way to introduce a new flavour to your veggie only fare.

 Good soup!,5,"I bought this on sale 40% off clearance price. It came out to about $0.62 per cup. Nice price! I like the taste. It's like mild-medium spiced. It vaguely reminded me of spicy bean soup. The couscous definitely has flavor (as opposed to most couscous I've tried). Someone with a light appetite could eat this as a meal. I believe it is vegetarian. I think it's a great value for good tasting food, and I would definitely eat this often. It's basically like a healthier ""cup-o-noodles"" because you just add hot water, wait, and eat it. If you care about the nutritional value, read on.

 My little yorkie is 14 years old and developed digestive problems a couple of years ago,5,"My vet gave him a prescription diet which helped him tremendously but he HATED it and wouldn't eat it until he just couldn't stand being hungry any more. With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return. Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription. Not only did he like it, he was fine! I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine! I was so happy!

 Warning: highly addictive!,5,"Senseo recently released several flavored varieties. Having always been partial to hazelnut coffee and being the happy owner of a Senseo coffee maker, I just had to give this new flavor a try. Well, let me tell you... I'm hooked! There is so much rich flavor in this coffee it's hard to believe the drink is calorie-free. It has the complex, subtle, thick texture and flavor of a fat- and carb-laden drink. If you've been worrying lately about the effects of your daily Caramel Macchiato on your waistline (not to mention your wallet) you have to give this coffee a try. It's wonderful and guilt-free! The pods are a little more expensive than regular varieties (the package is the same price but there are slightly fewer pods per bag) but boy is it worth that little extra! This flavor was all I needed to decide me to buy a second Senseo machine for my office. It's very quiet and doesn't bother my cube neighbors, and it's already paid for itself because I no longer spend a fortune at the coffee shop for mediocre coffee: I have my ""candy bar in a cup"" (to quote Paula) right at my desk.

 I think I might know what the change is in these bars.,3,"So there are a lot of reviews regarding the change in nutritional content between old Green Plus bars and new ones. Here's a quick breakdown of the changes: Old: 162 Cals (45 fat), 5g fat - 4 Monounsaturated & 1 polyunsaturated, 32mg Sodium, 18g Carbs - 4g Fiber & 12g Sugar, 12g Protein. New: 240 Cals (80 fat), 8g fat - 1 Saturated, 6 Monounsaturated, 75mg Sodium, 32g Carbs - 5g Fiber & 23g Sugar, 10g Protein. Ingredient list & new changes in parentheses: Ingredients: Organic medjool dates (Organic Dates - CHANGED), organic almond butter, organic quinoa sprout powder, non-gmo soy protein isolate, original GREENS+® powder (non-gmo soy lecithin, organic Hawaiian spirulina (Hawaiian Spirulina - CHANGED), organic apple fiber, barley grass powder (barley grass), wheat grass powder (wheat grass - CHANGED), Japanese chlorella, hydroponic soy sprouts, organic brown rice bran, sprouted barley malt, alfalfa grass powder (alfalfa grass - CHANGED), dairy-free probiotics (REMOVED), royal jelly, Montana bee pollen, acerola berry juice, natural vitamin E, licorice root powder, milk thistle extract (milk thistle seed extract - CHANGED), echinacea root extract, Siberian Eleuthero root extract, astragalus root extract, licorice root extract, organic red beet juice, dunaliella salina algae, organic Nova Scotia Dulse, organic ginkgo biloba leaf extract, organic Japanese green tea extract, grape seed and skin extract, organic Swedish bilberry extract), organic rice crisps, wildflower honey (organic honey - CHANGED), mixed tocopherols (natural vitamin E) (natural mixed tocopherols (vitamin E) - CHANGED). Biggest changes I saw were the type of dates used, and the switch from wildflower honey to ""organic honey"". I theorize that the reason the nutritional information changed was because they switched to a different type of date, with slightly more fat. I believe they added more of this new date and removed tiny amounts of other more expensive ingredients (protein powder). That would increase the sugar and calorie content as shown, lower protein levels, and raise the fat content slightly. So, if these bars taste more sweet, have more fat and have more sugar, it's due to the extra content of dates (and maybe almond butter) and decrease in soy protein powder. That's my theory. Either way the bars taste pretty good right now - and there are no better alternatives on the market. …",29 out of 30 users found this review helpful
 UNRELIABLE,2,"Well, Aerogrow is sending me another unit. They have already taken the trouble to send me a replacement bowl which fixed the first problem and later, they sent a replacement pump which shut down the entire system. I don't like contacting them and then getting replacements. My aerogrow setup does not look like the flourishing results at the local kitchenwares store. My consumer experience thus far has stank despite customer service's efforts to fix the problems. Customer service has remained courteous and attentive. They have mailed out parts promptly but does that buy them my silence? Well, I can see how the positive reviews are true on this site so make up your mind after reading all of them. Mine is just one experience. I lost money and I lost time and will start all over again once I receive the new unit. If I had ordered through Superstore, I would have just returned it for a money refund. So if you want to try hydroponic growing as I did, then go ahead and buy this but I urge you to buy from Superstore. Good luck. Here were my issues that were all responded to by aerogrow's customer service: (1) I was misled that by ordering directly from aerogrow instead of Superstore at the cost of Superstore's free shipping, I would become a special customer and receive discounts on future purchases on seeds and more machines. But when I wrote to aerogrow about not receiving any membership packet, I was told that the additional purchases should be made at the time of the initial purchase (when I have no experience with the worthiness of the aerogrow product) (2) aerogrow had to send me a new bowl because when I received the product the red indicator light for low water level was already on and NEVER shut off. Following the suggestions from the phone rep did not solve the problem at all. The new bowl fixed the problem. (3) Then I realized that deep in the growing period a number of herbs were not growing at all and was told that I had received a bad pump and would have to install a new one that Aerogrow would be sending me and that I would have to start all over again from the beginning with another packet of herbs that would be included in the package. (4) I unplugged the aerogrow and installed the pump according to the BLURRY pictures on the instruction sheet and now the entire machine will not turn on. Changing the pump is messy and not recommended. Don't throw away the attaching screw for the old pump because Aerogrow doesn't give you anything but the pump and the blurry instructions. The remaining survivors are going to die but that's okay because I have a brand new packet of seeds and in two months, I MIGHT have herbs, right? (5) I put the new plug in today and now the machine won't turn on at all. HELP! This product just isn't reliable and it is priced too high to be this risky. (6) Aerogrow reps always maintained a friendly tone and polite demeanor in dealing with me. However, I still felt wronged. When the replacement never showed up after weeks, I emailed requesting a full refund, offering to ship the machine back to them so they could investigate the problem. They said that I could chuck the old machine, the new one was at the post office because of a wrong address and that they would credit my credit card. I have to check to see if they did. I don't want another aerogrow anyway. …",128 out of 152 users found this review helpful
" Tried it in many uses, but didn't like it",2,"I bought this olive oil since it was organic, and went through 6 (750 mL) cans on a subscription, but in the end I decided to stop buying it. I bought this oil to be my basic mid-priced olive oil primarily for sauteing. I like all sorts of olive oil -- from soft and buttery to peppery and green. This oil has a heavy woody scent, not as fragrant as other good EVOO in this price range. Sampled uncooked, the oil has mild initial taste, not much olive flavor at all, but not unpleasant, but what I didn't like is its harsh after-taste. It was not good in salad dressings. With other flavorings, the harshness is muted but still remains. In cooked dishes any olive oil flavor mostly disappears. In the same price range, I've had better luck with obscure Spanish or Greek 1 L cans of EVOO from the supermarket. …",65 out of 77 users found this review helpful

 DO NOT PURCHASE THESE STRIPS IF YOU WISH TO KEEP YOUR DOG ALIVE!!!,1,"BUYER BEWARE! This caused severe intestinal bleeding and an inflamed stomach lining in two of my toy poodles who had to be taken emergency, to my nearest animal hospital! The vet bill cost me $1,200 for a $25 6 pack of death strips! I have the remaining 5 packs that are sealed and was going to return them to Superstore, but they don't accept edibles.. I always buy Mellow Mut and wanted to give these a try. I don't know what possessed me to switch, but I'm so sorry I did!!! They seemed a bit rough, like an old piece of leather, very coarse, not the usual kind of texture my dogs have been used to. I didn't think much of it at first, because they eat these types of treats all the time and they are supposed to be the ''nautral choice'' only healthful, not harmful! But, I never knew the damage they would cost my dogs. They began to become very listless after digestion, severe **** vomit and explosive, watery diarrhea with blood followed, almost to the point of shock!!! I just got home from a long night at the hospital with them and they are in a very delicate state and still not in the clear. I have to return with them if the vomiting continues for futher investagation! I don't know what to expect in the next couple of hours! They are on very strong medications and must follow a very bland diet for three weeks that is, if no more complications arise! I pray my babies make a full recovery! I urged Superstore to pull these off the website, before this tragedy occurs with another innocent life! They are poison for dogs, maybe this batch was just the contaminated one?

 Yummy way to save your teeth,5,"Let's face it. No one wants to get bad news from the dentist. Proper dental care can go a long way to keeping one's teeth for a lifetime. The generation that grew up in the Depression and World War II many times did not have good dental care. No fluoride, sealants, waterpiks, sonic toothbrushes and the like. It wasn't uncommon for a person in their 30s to be missing a few teeth. People generally could look forward to wearing dentures as their teeth became so rotten, the only thing to do was to pull them. Today, we don't have such problems. And one of the reasons is the use of xylitol to help kill the bacteria that cause tooth decay. The main reason for dental decay is a bacterium called S. Mutans. This bug feeds on sugars and starches, secreting acids which destroy tooth enamel, which leads to decay and cavities. There are various ways to defeat this bug, brushing, fluoride, flossing and sealants all have their place. A more modern addition to the decay-preventing fight is xylitol. It's a sugar alcohol that S. Mutans cannot digest. Sucking on mints or chewing gum with xylitol a few times a day is a easy and tasty way to curb this nasty bacteria. I've been chewing xylitol gum and eating xylitol mints for a number of years, and I've noticed that my dental problems have really improved. Highly recommended. My only complaint is that this gum is so delicious, I tend not to ration it to make it last longer. Try Spry. Your mouth will thank you for it. (Maybe not your dentist, though). …",14 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Danger,1,"I had my 1st baby in Dec 2010 and had alot of trouble produce milk. so at the advise of just about everyone including a lactaction consultant I tried a similar product also containing fenugreek. I researched it online and one of the side effect was ""intestinal distress"" well it didn't cause any problems for me, but my baby girl started having diarrhea. She also broke out in hives all over her face. So I did a medline search - something we do in the medical field. Needless to say I wish I'd researched this more before I took it. The medline searched stated the main side effect as intestinal distress but also listed the - allergic side effect I hadnt found before. 1st the hives but more distressing was - ""difficulty breathing , and loss of consciousness"" needless to say I freaked. Pumped and dumped for the next 4 days. It did increase my milk supply but at the potenical cost of my infants health - totally not worth it.

 Nutrition considerations if depend on large amounts of hemp,5,"Despite claims to the contrary, hemp protein is not a complete protein. It is very weak in lysine, and doesn't have enough leucine and tryptophan. Because of this, if you eat it in large quantities, especially in a vegetarian diet, it cannot count gram for gram. That is not to say it is not a very positive element of a well balanced diet in reasonable diet proportions or when complementary proteins balance the weaknesses. One tip: Protein from almonds and almond milk are also just as incomplete in lysine. Hemp seed protein has all essential amino acids - just not in the optimal proportions. You'd be hard pressed to find any protein that was nearly devoid of even one of them (ok, gelatin is a rare contender). ... it is good to separate the hype in the marketing of nutritional supplements and then to enjoy it for what it offers ;-) According to the amino acid data Nutiva, this manufacturer of this natural hemp 50% protein powder, provides on THEIR website - put in terms of proportions of each of the essential amino acids per actual gram of the hemp protein, this is NOT complete protein by definition. The standard ""complete protein"" definition you can find on Wikipedia defined, or on the Self (Nutrition) site is, in mg per gram overall protein: Tryptophan................7 Threonine................27 Isoleucine...............25 Leucine..................55 Lysine...................51 Methionine+Cystine.......25 Phenylalanine+Tyrosine...47 Valine...................32 Histidine................18 Hemp: Lysine is only 27/51: incomplete. If you look at the essential aa's stated on the Nutiva website and compared them to the definition of a complete protein above you will notably find less than 55% of the complete proportion of lysine. Tryptophan and BCAA leucine are also coming up short: three of the nine essential amino acids are thus lacking vs. a ""complete protein"". That gives hemp seed protein quality score of under 55 when a complete protein needs to be 100 or more. Normally protein quality is nothing to worry about since randomly several sources are combined and usually work out well. But some people seem to really push their protein intake very high for bulking up, etc., and others, usually not healthy are trying to supplement their needs to meet their numbers. In both of those cases protein quality will make or break their strategy. That is not to say they need to have complete proteins each time they eat: Only; they need to approximate optimal human essential amino acid proportions basically over a day or so. The bioavailability of hemp protein is decent - somewhere around 80% bioavailability - typical for veggies which presents a challenge. Compared to milk, egg or chicken, for example, these score in the high 90's for bioavailability in digestion (flavor and whether it agrees with you are different concepts). In perspective, and unfortunately, that makes hemp's protein quality worse than the approximate 55 ... All the above said hemp can be GREAT if balanced properly in the diet! You just need to quantify what you are getting and tailor it to your needs, when you use the supplements as a major portion of your diet. SUGGESTION: The bottom line is if you are in need of protein supplementation, be careful with counting on large amounts of hemp if you haven't complemented the relatively ""low protein quality"" with other ""low quality"" or otherwise complementary proteins (don't get misled by the use of the word quality ... all protein is good ... we are just looking to meet optimal human requirements and that is where the misnomer 'quality' is being applied). To get the correct mix for optimal diet needs... it would be critical to add at some point in the day, (this works) 100g of frozen spinach and a cob of corn or its equivalent in kernels to get the additional lysine and tryptophan per serving of hemp - it would be a reasonable vegetable source if you go the vegetarian route. Alternately, adding a reasonable amount of yogurt for its protein content works fine, and if you eat fish, cod is one of the best complements to hemp as it has a lysine score of about 180 vs. hemp's 55. ""Eat a well balanced diet"". Yogurt or whey protein in your diet will take care of that - combining it with hemp protein content 1:1; soy somewhat if you are vegan - but be careful of not overdoing it for your thyroid hormone with soy since that is controversial and certainly for people who have low thyroid hormone levels... find soy extracted with alcohol if this is the case since the hormones in soy (which many tout as 'good') are diminished during the alcohol extraction. Soy is great in moderation and offers better ""quality"" than hemp if you look at it alone, but properly part of a balanced diet, neither is better than the other. Believe it or not, eating too much protein can be a problem, too if you get supplemented out. This applies especially if the amino acid profile is not a good match for optimal nutrition conveniently found in meat, dairy and soy proteins (which are close to optimal individually eaten). Excess amino acids in a diet are disposed of by putting the liver to work. In extreme cases (somewhere over 1.2 grams protein per pound of body weight depending on the strength of your liver), you will get a yellower urine even when you drink lots. That is basically the nitrogen byproduct after the body burns and stores the protein it cannot use. So, if you eat an average protein quality of 55 and get your daily grams, you will actually only get let's estimate something of the order of 55% of that protein incorporated into you (ok, there is a bit more to it depending on the non-essentials, but this is the general idea) and the rest will be dumped into your liver, excreted nitrogen and the rest converted into energy or stored as glycogen or fat - there is no memory or ""protein reserve"" in the body. The excretion part will be in the form of urea. Too much urea in the urine puts you at risk for gout a disease you don't want to know about. All these consideration are for extreme cases. In healthy cases where hemp is part of a balanced diet it is a non-issue. So, best to eat a serving of spinach and cob of corn with a 30 gram serving of this hemp, beans and Swiss chard would be helpful, but really a well balanced diet including dairy is the healthy low risk situation keeping a general eye on fats but no dwelling on it to the point of worrying about gaining an ounce of weight every now and then ... that's why we need to exercise. Alternately you can spend a mint on amino acid supplement pills to raise the hemp to a ""higher"" quality protein than soy or whey for that matter ... People who are immobile have other issues and the bioavailability, supplementation and protein quality can become major issues for them. Like to preventing skin breakdown and bed sores to start with. Depends on your situation. …",205 out of 229 users found this review helpful

" Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me",5,"I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store. I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie. In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion. Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me. This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber. While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar. Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Beaba Babycook makes family meal time easier,5,"After reading some of the reviews, I almost got scared off this, and am glad I didn't. I did batch cooking for my first two kids, who are now 3 and 4. When it came time to move my 6 month old into solids, I wanted to home make his food also. But since I have less time and freezer space, batch cooking just wasn't feasible. I wanted to make his foods from the ingredients I was using for the family meals. Trying to puree small amounts in a regular size blender or processor is impossible. I saw this and though it would make meal time easier - and it does! Now the baby eats what we are eating, just steamed and pureed. I can make 3-4 servings at a time and just put the extras in singe serve containers in the fridge. I cooked a whole chicken, pulled off the meat and out it into small snack sized bags and put them in the freezer. Now while I am cooking for the older kids, I put one serving of chicken, with some veggies and/or fruit in the cooker and it cooks away while I am making dinner for the rest if the family. E.A.S.Y. -The mold issue other reviewers shouldn't be a problem, if you make sure the reservoir is empty and leave the top off so that it can air dry. Same for the blender/steamer parts. Just dry them between uses. I use water from my Brita to reduce build up between descaling. If your reservoir in a regular steamer isn't emptied all the way, it will do the same thing. -The counter top footprint is small, about ¾ of the size of my Kitchen Aid stand mixer. It's small and does small amounts, it doesn't say that it does large batches. So I'm confused as to how people are disappointed that it doesn't do large batches. It states it has a 2 ½ cup bowl. -The Beaba website sells the replacement parts all separately which I liked, just in case something needs replacing. I cook a lot and have has to replace blades on my large processor, so I'm glad that the parts are so easy to get. -The steamer does shut off automatically and the light goes off, but just like a regular steamer, if you leave food over boiling water, it will continue to soften. The booklet gives you the times for the steamer, so timing it is actually pretty easy. (Level 1 on the bowl is 7 minutes, level 2 is 10 minutes, level 3 is 15 minutes). -The Beaba website has more free recipes. (My kiddos fav is 2/3 pumpkin, 1/3 pear and a dash of pumpkin pie spice) -The blender part worked great for my 6 month old, totally pureed the pumpkin, carrot, sweet potato, pear, nectarine, banana and butternut squash that I pureed in there. I thinned with water or pear juice. -You hold the switch to the right to puree the food. For me, it's not a big deal to hold a switch for 30-60 seconds. So I don't see this as a design flaw. -The top and bottom don't line up perfectly - they can't or else too much pressure would build up in the steamer and it would pressure cook the food, not steam it. In short, This is my 3rd baby that I've cooked for at home, and I love this. Some of the design flaws others talked about aren't really flaws at all. I have to cook a meal for the kids at 5 and one for my hubby and I at 7 when he gets home.

When you're ready to eat it, turn it over and all the oil will be on the bottom. It's much easier to stir it this way than when the oil is on top. -MAKE SURE you store it in the refrigerator after it is opened.

 Best in Class Dry Dog Food,5,"Pet food has an immense range of quality that we like to roughly categorize into three levels. (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage; (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product; and (3) ""price is no object"" foods that make no compromises. Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it. It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog or cat food anywhere. Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with nothing but the highest quality ingredients. It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food out there. Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins. Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product (the whole list is good, but I have to stop somewhere so this review doesn't get too long): Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal. Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat. Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food , which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for ""hill's science diet dry dog food."" Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal. Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain. It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious. If you want a good compromise product, go for something like Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag , a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen. If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen. Final note: this is extremely rich food. Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process. We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen. That helped a lot. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 Don't Buy This!,1,"I guess the people at Superstore who decided this Nielsen Massey Orange Flower Water is a good substitute for Monteux can't taste, smell or feel. First, it tastes more like oranges than orange blossoms. And there's a hint of a gasoline-like flavor in there, too. Second, it doesn't smell like orange blossoms. It smells kind of like aged oranges - with a hint of that gasoline again. And it isn't a water. It's actually oily on the fingertips and you need to wash your hands after touching it. Monteux Orange Blossom Water was truly a water. Besides a flavoring, you could use it cosmetically. It had the slight perfume taste and smell of orange blossoms. And no fumes.

 excellent mass-market espresso,5,"Lavazza makes excellent espresso which for a widely available ""mass-market"" espresso a huge step up from the American drek like ""Starbucks"" or anything found found in local supermarkets. A bit more robust & flavorful than the fine but delicate Illy without the burnt harshness of Starbucks or ""Gloria Jeans"" or chain beaneries. Espresso should be flavorful but not burnt. It is also worth noting that most specialty shops or restaurant depots in this area will not have this particular Lavazza bean from my experience. Lavazza makes several espresso bean varieties (and some preground) and this particular one is very good and one I've used for years with other Lavazza espresso. Nice crema, smooth taste and you are probably more limited by your espresso machine and barista skills than you are this espresso roast :-) Making 3-5 cups daily of espresso one thing i really like about Lavazza beans are consistent in taste, texture and oily-ness, so you don't have to constantly tweak your grinder. I've tried many different brands & roasts but always seem to come back to Lavazza. The Lavazza beans also stays ""fresh"" quite long after opening the bag. They taste the same the first day you open the bag as they do a few weeks later. This is very handy if you do not go through a few pounds every few days so you neither have to throw out beans nor go espresso shopping every few days. Who knows how long the Lavazza bags sit in storage, but I have never encountered a stale bag which speaks well for the consistency of this product. I have used local roasters espresso beans and have found they typically do not hold it their flavor long. It seems the immediate ""fresh"" taste is great but in a few DAYS the local roasters beans fall off quickly in terms of being much drier (need to play with grinder every use) as well as become less flavorful and more bitter over time. Lavazza beans do not suffer from that problem which is another benefit. Lavazza is probably not the beans for tweak-and-geekers who like home-roast (ie. char-broiled beans) and prepare espresso more than they actually like to drink and enjoy it's taste. For real-life espresso drinkers who appreciate fine Italian espresso, Lavazza is a good place to start. …",40 out of 41 users found this review helpful

 Some Education About Vegan Cats,1,"Unfortunately most people are ill informed about vegan cats, including most veterinarians. Wild cats are in fact obligate carnivores. However, in domesticating the house cat and bringing it into our homes we have effectively removed the cat from its natural prey of mice, insects, birds, lizards, and other small creatures. During the past 100 years or so, as the human food industry was searching for a way to salvage and use all the waste materials from its processing lines, it came upon a wonderful solution. Lets boil it all up and dry it out and add it to the food we make for cats and dogs. As a result, the vast majority of commercial pet foods contain what are euphemistically referred to as the four D's, dead, dying, disabled, and diseased animals, along with other quite undesirable materials. Quite frankly, if you are feeding this junk to your pets, you are effectively poisoning them. We are seeing diseases in pets today that we have never seen before because of the wide variety of contaminated ingredients that are finding their way into the food we feed our companion animals. You know ""garbage in, garbage out!"" Now the issue here is not meat; it is about providing all the essential and non-essential amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and vitamins and minerals that are bio-available to the particularly unique physiology of felids (cats). The quality, quantity, and availability of these nutrients can come from any source, and for those of us who are vegan, the best source is vegetable based. Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of cats around the world live quite well on one of the several available vegan cat foods that are recognized as nutritionally complete. I personally have had 3 1/2 years of experience in feeding the Evolution kibble product that this review is addressing. It is a high quality product that is AAFCO certified as nutritionally complete for all life stages in cats. Not only is this product safe to feed your cat, but if you follow the recommended feeding procedures, you will find many benefits to both your cat's health and your wallet. If you desire more detailed information, I invite you to do a google search on vegan cats. I would put my web page information about this issue on this review, but it is against the policy for writing reviews on Superstore. Just for everyone's edification, I have researched this issue for well over 500 hours, read hundreds of technical papers, visited hundreds of web sites, and have made a commitment to specialize in feline nutrition as part of my Veterinary Technician studies. I probably know more about feline nutrition than 95% of all the vets in the world. My feline son is a vegan and will remain so because I am absolutely certain that his quality of life will be enhanced by his diet and that this choice will not be a detriment to his health. ------------------------------------- Since writing this review in 2006 I have had a change in position about this particular product after 4 years of personal experience. The manufacturer of the Evolution foods was changing the formulation of the food on a regular basis and during that time I found that the Feline Kibble was not able to maintain the pH level in the urine of cats that was promised on the label and in their literature. At least that wasn't the case with my former feline son and my current feline son. As a result I can no longer recommend the use of Evolution Feline Kibble for male cats. Since urinary issues are different between male and female cats the Evolution Kibble MAY be satisfactory for feeding to female cats. Nutritionally the Evolution foods seem to be fine for nutrients but not necessarily adequate for maintaining the proper pH levels to avoid urinary issues for male cats. Consequently I am now recommending male cats use the Vegecat pH diet provided by Harbingers of a New Age. My son has been eating this food supplement in a specially prepared gluten formulation I created called a vegan feline roast. It is 62% protein, 33% fat, and 5% carbs and has a moisture content of about 60%. Almost a perfect combination of ingredients to mimic natural prey. My son finds this product to be very palatable and his urinary pH has been consistently at 6.4 for the three years that we have been producing and consuming this food. The drawback is that it takes about a half hour every 3 days to make the food and the cost is equivalent to a premium cat food. But on the other hand my son is trim, full of energy at 6 1/2 years, enjoys great health, no longer has urinary tract issues, and no other animal had to die in order to provide my son with life-giving nutrition. UPDATE: 4/17/11 For those of you who are still considering feeding the Evolution kibble, please heed this warning. Kibble is only 10% moisture content. If you follow the directions given by the manufacturer to soak the kibble prior to feeding, you will end up with a mushy material that your cats may or may not like. The danger in feeding the dry kibble is that your cat will eventually become so dehydrated that no amount of drinking will be sufficient to avoid hydration related illnesses. Cats do not naturally drink water, they almost exclusively obtain all of their hydration from the food that they consume. If they are eating something that only has 10% moisture, upon consumption the moisture that is contained within the digestive tract of the cat will be sucked into the food in order to give it enough fluidity to pass through the intestines. This will often lead to gastro-intestinal diseases. Your cat will be constantly drinking water to make up for that deficiency, but no amount of drinking is enough to avoid the dehydration problem. So please remember that the best source of moisture for your cat's health, comes from a wet food diet that is around 70% moisture. In October 2008 I wrote an article about vegan cats published in VegFamily magazine. This information and more will help those who are interested in a vegan diet for cats understand more of the issues. UPDATE: 8/27/12 My vegan feline son is now 8 years old and still maintains an extremely healthy life with absolutely no issues of any kind. He has been using our Vegan Feline Roast product for the past 5 and 1/2 years and his lab tests indicate that his nutritional needs are being adequately met by his vegan diet. For those who are sceptical about a vegan diet for house cats, there is ample evidence that several vegan products are available to satisfy the nutritional needs of cats. I am still not convinced that Evolution is a good product to feed based on my past history. There are thousands of customers that seem to successfully feed the Evolution product; however, I believe that our Vegan Feline Roast Mix is a superior product that will yield far better results over the lifetime of feeding any house cat. Our product is based on the Vegecat phi supplement offered by HOANA, which I have found to be an excellent product for hitting all of the missing nutritional elements that would otherwise come from meat. The Vegecat product line has been successfully feeding thousands of cats over a 27 year period and we highly recommend the use of Vegecat for those people who wish to formulate their own vegan cat food. The only difference between our food product and the HOANA vegecat product is that our product is a ready-to-make mix that has been specifically formulated for a high protein/high fat food that is easy to make and highly palatable to the vast majority of cats. I would caution people feeding the Evolution kibble to reconsider doing so. The problem with kibble in general, not just the Evolution product, is the 10% moisture content of the food. Cats that eat kibble exclusively will invariably become dehydrated and will not be able to consume enough water by drinking to avoid the condition. Evolution kibble that is soaked with water prior to feeding, as recommended by the manufacturer, is an attempt to avoid this issue. However, by soaking the product you will reduce the palatability quality to most cats and will make it harder for them to continue to want to eat the product. This is a strategy to fix a problem that is inherent to the product itself. As time goes on, I become more convinced that using our Vegan Feline Roast product may in fact be a cure for diseases in cats like FLUTD and diabetes. At some point in time I would like to perform a long term double blind scientifically significant study to support my empirical observations. When my son started out 7 years ago eating Evolution kibble, he quickly developed a FLUTD condition, after 18 months of use, that cost $1500 at the vet to fix. The last 5 1/2 years of eating nothing but our Vegan Feline Roast he has remained FLUTD free and maintains excellent health. Just the savings alone from avoiding annual teeth cleaning has more than paid for itself in the use of our product. So my bottom line is to recommend not using Evolution Kibble in favor of either the HOANA vegecat supplement or our Vegan Feline Roast Mix. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" More ""fragrant"" than flavorful",3,"We bought this in hopes of turning our homemade lattes into white chocolate mochas, based on the rave reviews. I was disappointed by this product. It's not terrible, and does taste moderately decent, but really, I don't see what all the fuss is about. I've had plenty of white chocolate mochas in my life, and this product just didn't deliver. We usually use organic brown sugar to sweeten our coffees, and in all honesty that tastes WAY better. And is a lot cheaper! The powder is a strange mix of ingredients - none of them real white chocolate. I don't like the fact that it contains Partially Hydrogenated Oils, and, I don't even like using it because it feels like someone just shot a dustcan of vanilla up your nose every time you use it no matter how careful you are. Or like you've snorted vanilla talcum powder. The only thing I can compare it with, is the odd way that microwave popcorn flavoring used to get ya right in the nose, before they removed the diacetyl. ... It feels invasive and chemically induced LOL. Also, when you taste the coffee you make with this product, you're more smelling than tasting. Try holding your nose. Yeah I know scent is a huge part of taste, but this product seems strangely reliant on its phony vanilla scent, and there's really no flavor without it. It also tastes and smells completely unnatural - fake chemical white chocolatey taste/smell instead of real white chocolatey taste/smell. I expected much more from a brand like Ghiradelli, and for the price. It's not great for the waistline either, by adding a whopping 21 grams of carbohydrate to your cup of joe, and 2.5 grams of SATURATED fat per serving. My organic sugar adds between 4-8 grams of carbs, depending on whether I double the serving! Overall, it's fun to try, but not when you have to buy this much of it at one time, and is now a 7/8 full tub of disappointment sitting on our countertop. It's best moment: We experimented and tried it on buttered popcorn. That was kind of good, made a sort of kettle corn taste, aside from the vanilla powder nasal invasion. I'm listing the ingredients here, because I really feel that calling this ""ground white chocolate powder"" is so misleading it's unfair to the consumer, and I don't see the ingredients shown in the listing. Ingredients: Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Coconut Oil, Corn Syrup Solids, Sodium Caseinate, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Dipotassium Phosphate, Propylene Glycol Esthers of Fatty Acids (not kidding), Mono- and Di-Glycerides, Sodium Silico Aluminate (Mmmm), Salt, Soy Lecithin, Calcium Carageenan, and Artificial Color. Just a tip, consider trying organic brown sugar in your lattes and cappuchinos instead. Not the ""sugar in the raw"" brand, but a real organic brown. We find it adds a nice (natural) caramel-ly taste, kind of a cross between a Starbucks white chocolate mocha and caramel macchiato - very tasty. …",32 out of 34 users found this review helpful
" Delicious, Quality Popcorn",4,"I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Superstore. This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion. It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic. When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels. The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease. The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be). However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet. I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping. It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank! A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice. I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use! UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+! :o) I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels. I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.

 tasty Maybe beneficial,5,"My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two. At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Now BPA-free!,5,"Just wanted to follow up on the last post. Muir Glen recently announced that they no longer use BPA in their can lining, starting with the fall 2010 harvest! Cans without BPA are being shipped now, so cans you find in stores now may or may not contain it. I am so happy to see a brand that I can actually find in my grocery store commit to not using BPA. Plus, I really like their canned tomatoes and think the quality is better than Hunt's. Their crushed tomatoes with basil actually contain whole basil leaves, not just basil ""flavor."" …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Decent taste - 5 servings per box,4,"I get tired of labels selectively enhancing numbers to mislead, so these get a star off for that. Big bolded letters it says: ""10 bars"" below, in smaller letters you'll see a small pack has 2 bars. At least they have the decency to call a serving (at the back on small letters: 2 bars). The bars are very small, so it's no surprise that this is the case. On a positive note, the oats are organic, as are a lot of the ingredients. The bars crumble a bit much, so you might lose a piece or two to the floor. Overall, given the quality of the ingredients, and the decent taste, these are a good choice. However, a lot of the time the cost per bar* (10 bars in a box, 2 per pack) is close to a dollar, an honestly, anything over 50 cents is way too much for the size of these, and you would be better off with any of the other products out there that fill you up even more (1 dollar protein bars come to mind - they weigh a lot more than 2 of these). …",35 out of 37 users found this review helpful

 An excellent alternative to candy or other snack bars.,5,"These bars are fantastic tasting. They do have 7g sugar per bar (for a 36g bar that's nearly 20% sugar). For people with a sweet tooth like me, these are a great alternative to other chocolate, candy, and less healthy snack bars. Sure, there are plenty of things out there that are better for you, but I've yet to find any that taste like this.

 Best Ever,5,"It all started when a co-worker and I found a trade show branded super ball in a forgotten box of office supplies. You know - you throw it, it bounces - it's all fun and whatnot. We got a coffee break's worth of entertainment out of it before we moved on and forgot about it. Well, I never forgot about it. I jumped on Superstore where I found these bad boys (seriously, what _can't_ you buy here?!), and they shipped in just a few days. I brought the bag in to the office a couple weeks ago, just for fun. Since then, I'm quite surprised that we haven't gotten fired with all the crazy pranks and games we've come up with. From rigging them to fall when the door is opened, to hiding them in the mini-fridge for an after lunch store-the-leftovers WTF, we've certainly gotten every cent worth of entertainment out of these things. Sure, we made up games to pass the time during rainy lunch breaks (I bet you can't bounce it from the whiteboard to the wall, off the window and into the trash can), but the situation quickly devolved into all-out war. Some afternoons start out mildly enough with a simple game of double-bounce into the coffee mug, but wind up with tables overturned and 250 bouncy **** flying at near-mach speeds to land squarely between the eyes of a hopeless co-worker. I don't care that you volunteered to implement the latest changes to the product at the last sub-committee meeting; when the super **** come out, there are no friends anymore. At any rate, I don't know what you're expecting when you buy a bag of bouncy **** on the Internet for eight cents apiece, but trust me, whatever your plans, it's worth it. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" Creamy, rich flavor, excellent!",5,"I've been making my own yogurt for quite a while now, but was pleasantly surprised when I tried this starter. So far, it's the best I've tried, and I've tried quite a few. My yogurt sets much more quickly, and has a nice creamy texture instead of the clumping I find with some other starters. I've re-cultured five generations so far, and it's holding up wonderfully. Wonderful light fresh taste. Give it a try! …",27 out of 28 users found this review helpful
 Love this product,5,"Our 10 year old lab mix started having problemswith his hip joints. He has always been an active dog and watching him lay around and not want to interact was hard to see. Initially our vet gave us Rimadyl to get him through the acute phase, but it is a bit pricey and I know that it is hard on their stomach and kidneys. I searched the internet and read reviews for several days, each time my reasearch led me back to this product. Off I went to the local pet supply store to get this treat. When I opened the bag I thought for sure that my dog would turn his nose up at them, they smell awful....well my husband now calls these ""doggie crack"", our dog LOVES these treats. As soon as he sees the bag he RUNS to get his snack. Yep RUNS. Not only am I giving him something he loves but something that has helped him with mobility. I followed directions I found at a vets website to double the dose for several weeks and then give a maintenance dose of glucosamine after that....what a difference!!! Shop around as I only purchase these at the local store if I make a mistake and run out! There is quite a difference in price from stores to online. I am completely sold on this product and have now started purchasing some of their other treats and products as well!! Can't go wrong with Zukes! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Having some issues with this door,1,"I'm happy to hear that others are having good luck with this product. Unfortunately, our experience has not been quite as positive. First, I was a bit disappointed at the construction. For this price point I would have expected something other than flimsy plastic. Second, within a month of buying the door the retractable plastic piece started randomly going up and down. I called their customer service department to inquire. The rep described it as a known issue. The solution was to disable the auto-retract safety feature. I asked when a permanent fix was forthcoming and she told me that disabling the safety feature WAS the fix. Baffled, I asked if she thought that was a good solution. She told me I could return the product for a refund if I wanted to (after having cut a hole in the side of my house) in that pseudo-polite, passive-aggressive manner that makes me want to rub broken glass in my eyes. I hope that she was simply someone who needs to be fired rather than a typical representation of the company. Third, as others have noted,the collar and ""fob"" are extraordinarily flimsy. My standard poodle destroyed hers within a few weeks. Compared to other dogs, she is very gentle so I was surprised when it just fell apart. I was able to click it back together a few times and get it working, but this last time I saw some sort of yellow-ish corrosive looking goo inside it. My wife called their customer service and they are sending a replacement. Meanwhile,the poor dog is very confused. :) Fourth, the fob is NOT directional. We have fought with sensitivity settings until we are cross-eyed and whenever the dog is close to the door, it opens. Had we paid $50 or $75 for this product I wouldn't have even bothered with this review. But, at ~$400.00 (including wall extension, extra batteries, shipping, etc) I am fairly disappointed. I hope others find this helpful. …",41 out of 41 users found this review helpful

 Looks like 2-star cocoa being sold as 4 1/2-star cocoa... don't buy it!,1,"Ordered a package of this cocoa around April 25th 2011. It was fabulous. Worthy of the 4 1/2 stars rating. Deep rich color. Well sealed. So good we needed to reorder about a month later. So went back to same Superstore site, same picture and did reorder. This time however, upon arrival it was not same company, packaging or label (hokey looking)... Instead of ""Frontier"" it said ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Upon further investigation I went to my Superstore history and noticed first batch came from Sold by: Bangalla Organic Wholesale LLC and second batch came from Sold by: Organic Herbal Essence. Keep in mind that Organic Herbal Essence is the cocoa that sells on Superstore that is only rated at 2-stars:[...] I checked and can't return it. Called Organic Hebal Essence during business hours, left message, no one returned my call. My opinion is just slapping a tiny white Avery label on the bag with tiny print (really tiny) that says ""Frontier Cocoa"" doesn't eliminate the huge color label on the bag that says ""Organic Herbal Essence... Dutch Cocoa"". it certainly doesn't turn a 2-star cocoa into a 4 1/2 star cocoa. My main frustration is it is obviously a different company and different packaging, but no explaination or offer to refund. Seems like a ""bait and switch"". My advice; take a pass on this one until they get it sorted out. …",138 out of 143 users found this review helpful

Erythritol contains 2.6 calories per gram. There are 12 grams of erythritol in each can. Most erythritol is made from fermenting GMO corn. How healthy is that?

 Great product,5,"This is a high-quality product, and I agree with the first reviewer: it would cost as much, if not more, to make this yourself from the same oils from retail bottles and jars. I've been making my own mayonnaise for years and while homemade is my favourite; with the price of top-quality, extra virgin olive oil right now, it just doesn't make any sense. And I'd hate to compromise with a lesser oil. This mayo is tasty as is and also takes very well to additions of lemon juice, minced garlic, dill, tarragon, and capers; as well as pureed roasted peppers, garlic, sea salt and cayenne pepper. I even use it for spicy tuna hand rolls: mix finely chopped, sashimi-grade fresh tuna with some of this mayo, a bit of Nama Shoyu, Umeboshi plum vinegar, hot pepper toasted sesame oil and minced hot red chiles and scallions to taste. Now I'm all hungry. This is a great staple to have on hand, and will adapt to whatever you throw at it. Best of all, you can feel peaceful about eating the health-promoting fats in this mayo and avoiding the soy, canola, chemically treated salt and preservatives in the other brands out there. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Never leave home without it!,5,I am an avid fan of Emergen-C. I do my best to get in 2 a day. I started taking them when I was on a new diet. I was going to a clinic and the nurses recommended them to ensure that I got all of my daily vitamins. Your body absorbs vitamins much more this way rather than taking the huge horse pills. The clinic also recommend them to help curb headaches. I was giving up my beloved 'Diet Coke' and this was the only thing that made it possible. Plus the B vitamins really boost your metabolism. These are also great when you feel a cold coming on. They really help to boost your immune system. I never leave home without Emergen-C! I always have a stash in my purse! I've liked all of the flavors I have tried so far. I love mixing them with Crystal light or something similar. With the Raspberry I mix this with the Lemonade Crystal Light and made it Raspberry Lemonade. It's delicious. I've also put it in with Diet Sprite and it was very good. …,14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************,2,"First off, the initial arrival: It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat! Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary. Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective; 1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces 2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several. 3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging. In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags. Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's. Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way. But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Superstore charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping). If you wanted to buy using Superstore Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings. An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats …",1 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Catches More Than Fleas,5,"I first started using the Ultimate Flea Trap when I lived in California because we had a problem with sand fleas coming in our back patio screen door. We also didn't want to use any pesticides, since we had four small house pets. When we moved to Michigan, we continued using the traps because our child was born, and we felt even more strongly about avoiding pesticides. Although we did not have a flea problem, the traps have caught several types of spiders, the occasional house fly, a few random creepy crawlies, and even a hornet! Basically, they seem to trap anything attracted to the light/heat. We keep them tucked away, out of sight (ex: in a back corner of our furnace room, under furniture), and in places where the pets can't get too curious -- getting a refill stuck to your skin (or dog fur) is the absolute worse. All in all, I think we've been using these traps for nearly ten years now. The bulbs can be replaced with regular night light bulbs or the new LED bulbs. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 for true coffee connoisseurs,5,"This brew is a VERY robust and chocolatey coffee. If bold brews are your favorite, this is the right blend for you. It offsets sweets and desserts well because of its strong aroma and flavor. It also has cacao undertones of its own that will remind you of a dark chocolate bar. It is NOT a very good iced coffee unless you plan to use it as an iced mocha. In a french press: be sure that you add a little extra beans, itll give this blend that extra punch that makes it chocolatey. be VERY careful not to over brew, 3-4 minutes is enough. It will quickly go bitter if you aren't careful (I smell it on occasion to make sure it doesnt get bitter). Compared to other Raven's Blends: This is definitely one of their darkest roasts.
