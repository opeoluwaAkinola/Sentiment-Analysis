 Excellent resource for increasing your milk supply,5,"My milk supply began to decrease significantly after I started back to work (my son was about six month's old at this time). I took -- and still take, 3 tablets of fenugreek and blessed thistle each per day at least twice a day. If I am not able to pump, I add another round of the herbs and let my son nurse more, to keep my milk supply going strong. This is a wonderful blessing to know that my milk supply can easily be reestablished, if stress, schedule or other factors inhibit our desire to feed the old fashion way! Five stars for fenugreek (and blessed thistle, too!) As a side note, the lactation nurses have told me, that these herbs do lower your blood sugar, so they should be taken with food. I say that from experience. All in all, it more than met my expectations. …",40 out of 41 users found this review helpful
 The best oil for popping corn!,5,"This popcorn oil is the best for popping corn anywhere. I have used it at home in my PopStir (similar to WhirleyPop) on the stovetop and at school functions in a commercial popcorn popper. If you use this oil, you probably won't even have to add any butter to the popcorn after it's popped - so no cholesterol and less fat. A special feature of this product: It will NOT form black ""varnish"" inside or outside of your kettle - be it a commercial machine or a home version - it is a clean oil. This oil is solid at room temperature, and you will need some sort of scoop (as an ice cream or cookie scoop) to measure it out of the container. This oil gives popcorn the fragrance, taste and COLOR of commercially popped theater popcorn. You won't regret your purchase of this item. …",33 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 About half the claimed weight!,1,"While the variety was interesting, the description was highly deceptive. The weight was listed as 5 pounds, but adding the weights from the candy included yielded only slightly more than half of that, at 2.8 pounds. There were, as claimed, more than 30 pieces (35), but only six were full-price/size chocolate bars. Much of the rest was cheap filler, not the full-sized pieces touted in the description. For example, there were several types of gum included, as well as small pieces of taffy, and many items weighed less than half an ounce (in one case, a tenth of an ounce). The actual value of the candy appeared to be $10 to $12, at most, and the presentation--thrown in a printed carton with a single sheet of crumpled paper--was certainly not worth the rest of the price. Many items looked shopworn due to this poor packing, and all brittle items (such as Necco wafers) arrived in fragments. Anyone receiving this as a gift would assume that the giver spent about $15 on it, not $40. I feel cheated. …",26 out of 28 users found this review helpful
 for fretting felines and canines,5,"This 100% natural product for cats and dogs going through stressful times includes the same active ingredients as those for the relief of tension in some natural human formulas, like valerian and chamomile, and also apparently has a good taste, as a dropper full of the liquid in food is devoured with relish; it also includes passion flower and fructose, which is probably why it has a sweet aroma, and adds to the palatability. Other ingredients are hops, scull cap, and inert ingredients include deionized water and sodium benzoate. I've found it very useful on two occasions, once when trying to catch a young feral kitty, and secondly, to relieve the anxiety of my devoted eight year old Liddy when introducing the young cat into the household. Also good for pets that are nervous travelers, and those few animals that get upset when being groomed. Richard's Organics Pet Calm claims that it ""Treats short-term stress"", and in my situations, it has worked beautifully. Depending on the size of the dog or cat (1 dropper = 1 ml. / Up to 40 lbs., 1-4 ml. / Over 40 lbs., 3-6 ml.), there are a lot of doses in this 2 oz. bottle, and I think it's an excellent value. Liddy, Maggie and I are very satisfied customers of this product, which has made our lives easier and more peaceful. …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful
" Fast, easy and excellent espresso",5,"In about 3 minutes, this machine grinds the beans (no separate appliance needed for that!), tamps down the grind (no separate tool for that!)and produces foamy hot espresso. Plus, the steam is strong enough to foam up 2% milk! Everything cleans up in a flash...second cup, no long wait. If you like strong coffee set the grind about four clicks from the maximum setting and the setting for amount of coffee for each use at the max. Lovely. …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 WHAT'S A PIZZA WITHOUT ANCHOVIES ?,5,"As far as I'm concerned a pizza just isn't worth eating unless it's generously decorated with anchovies. However, I'm the only one at our house who feels this way. On weekend nights we frequently order in from our favorite pizza place, and since I must have anchovies I keep these on hand to garnish my share of the pie. (Never would dream of imposing my educated taste on others ;-) We've tried other brands - the ones packed in oil tend to fall apart; others have been tasteless. These have a rich flavor and are meaty enough to hold their shapes. They're the best we've found. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Start your morning with a roar,5,"Move over coffee, I'll take some Morning Thunder. When my doctor told me I had to seriously limit my coffee, (from 3-4 cups a day to 1 or 2 cups per week) I despaired. How could I have the energy I craved to jumpstart my day without coffee? I tried various teas and coffee substitutes with limited success. When I found mate, I knew I was half-way there because I liked the energy, but I longed for stronger taste. Hence, when I found Morning Thunder, with half mate and half black tea, I rejoiced. A steaming cup of this, graced with soy milk, is truly a gift from God. Enjoy! …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Great Product In Wrong Container,5,"Undoubtedly, the purchase and use of stool softeners would plummet if everyone, including physicians, considered magnesium. Fact: An insufficient amount of magnesium in the body is a primary cause of constipation and hemorrhoids, yet most physicians unwittingly recommend stool softeners. Fact: By taking your measure of Natural CALM daily your constipation will quickly subside. Friends, before you devour any more medications why not try a natural remedy? Natural CALM is an easy-to-assimilate powder that when mixed with water becomes effervescent. More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM. Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars. Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage. Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: ""Place powder in a glass or mug,"" it says. ""Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water."" Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide. Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy. Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch. Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors? No fructose added. For further information call customer service at (866) 416-9216. Take charge of your health. Live life to the fullest. …",17 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 Great addition to the kitchen...,5,"I have to admit that this is a great addition to the kitchen. My daughter-in-law introduced me to sticky rice. My wife and I were on vacation at the time and when we got home the first thing I did was look for the tools to make it. I found this product and am extremely pleased with it. Shipping time was great. I think it was only about 3 or 4 days for it to come all the way across the country. Nothing was damaged and nothing was missing. The aluminum cooker, bamboo basket and cheesecloth were all there along with the bag of rice. Instructions were included as well. I think we made our first batch the very next day. The cheesecloth keeps everything in place and keeps the basket from getting messy. Cleanup is easy too. If you want to try sticky rice or just need a replacement this will be a great addition. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Trio bars are delicious!  My favorite energy/snack bars,5,"Mrs. May's Trio bars are my favorite snack/energy bars. I love them. They come in four flavors and you get five of each flavor in this variety box. Blueberry is my favorite, followed by strawberry (I like berry flavors). Cranberry comes in third, but I still really like it, just not as much as blueberry and strawberry. Though cranberries are pretty tart, the cranberry bar is not noticeably tarter than the others. My least favorite is the tropical but only because it has a less distinct taste than the others. The name comes from the ingredients. The bars have a trio of trios: 3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits. The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors. The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios. The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower. The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don't really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the ""glue"" that holds all the other ingredients together. The third fruit in each flavor is (obviously) dried fruit in the named flavor, though the tropical is a blend of three different tropical fruits, none of which dominates. The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt. These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy. The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher. They also have no preservatives. If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts. Because of the nuts, they have 12 grams of fat per bar, but I've been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is ""good"" fat. The label says there is 1.5 grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated. To round out the rest of the nutrition facts: calories, 170; total carbs, 14g; dietary fiber, 2g; sugars, 6g; protein, 5g; cholesterol, 0g; trans fat, 0g; and sodium, 45mg. I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have. They are low sodium but high in taste and they are really satisfying. I used to get granola bars but these are so much better. …",33 out of 40 users found this review helpful
 Probably my favorite combo pack...,4,"First off, you won't find ""tasting notes"" in this as I don't have the developed palate of a wine connoiser. My take on coffee/wine is - I just know what I like. I happen to love Tully's coffee. This pack is a staple in my house for personal use and for guests. You get four flavors (French, Italian, House, Kona) of K-cups. All are on the bolder side of the spectrum, but I wouldn't say they were extra-bold. I like coffee with a punch in the morning as I often only have time for one cup before I leave. The Italian or French are good for that. They are the boldest of the four flavors included. Nice flavor, strong, clean coffee taste without a an odd/burned aftertaste. Kona has a typical (to me) Kona flavor. Nothing super special, but a good cup of coffee! I do tend to reserve these for my sister as she loves them. :) House is probably the mildest of the bunch. A good cup for evening use (or second cup of the day) when you don't need that big coffee BANG. I was worried that when Green Mountain took over Tully's K-cup business that I would have have to find another ""go to"" K-cup. I've been quite pleasantly surprised that the coffee hasn't seemed to change. …",25 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 WAY overpriced - Deceptive Description,1,"I love all natural or organic products that are good for you. This Mrs. Mays Trio Blueberry product seemed to be such a product. The taste is good. I like the combination of berries, seeds, and nuts. But when I received the product, the image shown on the webpage description is not the same as the product I received. The actual product is VERY small -- only 1.2 ounces. About twice the size of a 5-stick pack of gum. Certainly NOT worth about a dollar each! In fact, it is not worth even 50 cents each, in my opinion. The image on the website shows a 1.7 ounce bar. What I received was 1.2 ounce bars. That's about 30 PERCENT smaller than the advertised product. Needless to say, I was not happy at all. I was deceived. I do not believe a 1.2 ounce bar of nuts is worth close to $1 in cost. Although I like the taste and nutrition, I would not consider purchasing this item again unless the cost falls to around $5 for a 12-pack or $10 for a 24 pack. That's about the most I can justify paying for what you get. Right now, the price at Superstore is $23.57 for a 24 pack -- or about $1 per small 1.2 ounce bar. Outrageous. …",18 out of 20 users found this review helpful

" Great product, but beware.",3,"I definitely agree with all the good things that the other reviewer say about this product. I've used MRPs (mostly Met-Rx) for decades and also attest to their benefits. However, I gave it only three stars because I strongly object to the ad's omission of the fact that Labrada Nutrition's Lean Body contains sucralose. Sucralose replaced aspartane---which from its invention at Searle was known to damage brain cells---as the no-calorie sweetner of over whelming choice by food packagers. Regrettably, sucralose is known to kill off our probiotics, the bacteria that enable food's digestion! We all have the right to take our chances. Nevertheless, the vendors of products that they encourage us to eat have the duty to inform of what those chances are. …",34 out of 35 users found this review helpful

 Creamers Burst During Transit - Sticky,2,"Read through the other reviews and you will find the same situation I had with the creamers. It does not arrive in the blue dispenser box that is shown, the 192 creamers arrive loose inside a cardboard box with no padding. Perhaps less creamers would burst during transit if the display box shown was wrapped inside a cardboard box. The box arrived completely undamaged on the outside. None appeared to have frozen during transit, it appears that the creamer singles pop during high altitude transit or perhaps when the box is thrown by the shipper or pressure is placed on the box. It is a sticky mess when it arrives. The creamer taste and convenience is great, but it is unfortunate that so many people have commented on this problem and Interational Delight has not fixed its packaging and shipping issue. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 An all-time favorite.,5,"I grew up in a family of tea drinkers; and although I now tend to have a lot of coffee while I'm at work, I still drink almost exclusively tea when I'm at home. I generally prefer loose leaf teas - that way I know I'll get ""the real thing,"" whereas tea bags tend to contain merely the leftovers of a harvest; little crumbs too poor in aromatic and other content to otherwise pass quality control standards. The exception are Bigelow teas: and first and foremost among those their flagship, Ruth Bigelow's original ""Constant Comment"" with its recipe of black tea, orange grind and holiday spices (primarily cinnamon). Created by Mrs. Bigelow on the basis of an old colonial recipe over half a century ago, the blend soon became so popular among her friends that their ""constant comments"" of approval prompted Ruth and husband David Bigelow to found their own tea company. Since then, ""Constant Comment"" has long become a true classic ... and if you love tea, it is indeed the perfect refreshment; whether or not it's Christmas time. (E.g., it also makes for great iced tea in summer; particularly if you add a bit of lemon.) If you're making more than a single cup of tea, and unless you like your tea *very* weak, you may want to rethink the company's measuring directions - based on the the ""one bag per cup"" ratio, you'll likely need two or more bags for an entire pot (depending on size), even when steeping an extra minute or two. That said, though ... wanna come over for a cuppa? …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 New Ovaltine - Please give me the original formula!,1,"What a disappointment it was to try the new Nestletized ""Malt Classic Ovaltine."" Gone are the granules - instead, it's now a fine powder.

 Please be aware that this is an eggnog powder/mix and not a ready-to-drink eggnog,3,"I saw the tin and quickly bought it, thinking it was a ready-to-drink eggnog. IT IS NOT. Also, a cursory review of the product description did not lead me to believe it was a powder/mix. I think the company may have meant to use the description ""blend"" (and other references to ""Cocktail Mixers"" on the same page as the product) to let the customer know it was a powder/mix. However, the description ""blend"" does not necessarily mean a powder/mix to everyone. Also, other references to ""Cocktail Mixers"" may have been on the page with the product (for example, at the bottom of the ""Product Details"" section it shows the product is listed under ""Cocktail Mixers""), however a ""Cocktail Mixer"" reference does not necessarily mean the product is a powder/mix (and some cocktail mixers I have previously bought could be consumed as a ready-to-drink mixer with the option to be used for a cocktail). Regardless, before I purchased the product, I did not--and other customers may not--see such a ""Cocktail Mixer"" reference. I would have wanted to know that this product is an eggnog powder/mix (and NOT a ready-to-drink eggnog) before I purchased it. Maybe if the company were to add a ""Product Description"" section and clearly state this is a powder or mix (and not a ready-to-drink eggnog), it would keep other customers from misunderstanding. …",5 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 These scare me.  Look at what I've found online:,1,"I was all set to buy these thinking they'd be great for my dog. Then I found: ""At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top-selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died."" The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. ""Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,"" the directions say. Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic. ""These things tend to be wolfed down,"" said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver.

 What it is....,3,"As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying ""fresh"" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;) The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag.

I think that just taking in the extra fluids helps. If you are having a big dip in your milk supply I would suggest taking Fenugreek capsules. Makes you smell like maple syrup, but really works. Fenugreek in combination with this tea should help supply issues. I'd continue drinking the tea long after supply is back to normal, sort of insurance. Oatmeal has been said to help too. If your supply is causing nursing problems or concerning you, please contact your lactation consultant or midwife. With help a low supply really can be fixed. Good luck and happy nursing! …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Jar size (4 oz) should be listed on product,2,"There's nothing wrong with Earth's Best baby foods if you're looking specifically for a wide variety of organic foods and are willing to pay more for that option. However, if you're looking for the best deal monetarily, Earth's Best is rarely the best option. When I saw this large package deal on Superstore and looked at the weight listed (11.1 lbs), I did some math and thought I'd be getting 6 oz jars, putting these on the pricey end, but reasonable enough. However, the package I received -- two flats of 12 4 oz. jars of baby food -- had each flat labeled 3 lbs. I'm not sure how two 3 lb. flats become 11.1 lbs, but the result is that I ended up with far less baby food than the weight implied. If you're a regular Earth's Best user and are willing to shell out the extra money for organic baby food to be delivered to your door, this is probably a fine product for you. If you're a mom like me who's looking for ways to cut costs, this isn't one of them. …",7 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 Addicted to this tea.,5,"I bought this at the local Asian market, sat down on a rainy weekday to watch Garden of the Finzi Continis and was instantly mesmerized by its freshness, seaweedy taste, and the whole harmony of that moment. I couldn't get enough of it- I drank 6-8 cups a day for a month. It's just a great complement to anything that you've eaten. I bought the Sencha Special Grade from Upton Tea, thinking it must be better than this since it's twice as expensive, but the Yamamotoyama is a shade better for my taste. I can never go back to tea bags, especially tasteless brands like Bigelows or Tazo. I don't mind some black tea bags, but not the fannings they use in green tea bags.

Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain.

(So far, I've lost 25 pounds.) Why Stevia Plus ®? It is herbal and the only recommended brand by author Ann Louise Gittleman.

 I'm not sure what to think . . . and neither does my dog,2,"I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this ""Lickety Stik"" device. It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works. My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it. This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those. The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet. It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat. Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out. You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring. I probably won't be buying this again. …",10 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Tastes great ... and gets 2-year-old approval,5,"These multrigrain chips taste like restaurant-quality corn tortilla chips, but they come in individual-sized bags. Most importantly, my two-year-old daughter (who is so picky she hardly eats anything) absolutely LOVES these chips. These chips are technically ""multigrain"" because they contain yellow corn, brown rice flour, flax seeds, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and soy flour. However, stone ground yellow corn is clearly the main ingredient in these chips and you'll have a hard time picking up the flavor of the other ingredients with your taste buds. The other thing I really like about these chips is that they're flavored with sea salt, which is lower in sodium and (in my opinion) tastes better than regular table salt. With only 140 calories per bag and 7 grams of fat it's hard not to say yes to this tasty treat. Overall, I highly recommend these chips! …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful

One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids.

 No Maltodextrin!!!,5,"This product is the best meal replacement drink I have seen to date. I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't. The main difference between this meal replacement and other meal replacement products I've seen is in the carbohydrates they provide. Most other meal replacements I've seen either use sugars or maltodextrin as their main carbohydrate. The problem with this is that they have a high glycemic index. This means that when you eat them, your blood sugar rapidly rises and your body responds by making a lot of insulin. Then in a very short time, your blood sugar is low and you have no energy and are hungry again. This product is low sugar and no maltodextrin which is great. Hopefully it has a low glycemic index. The oil blend is this product looks to be good. They don't report the exact percentages of omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids but they do contain omega fatty acids. As for the protein, it's a blended protein that's 40 grams per serving. In my opinion, the taste of these products is great, but that's only an opinion. Concerning the nutritional value of this product, everything I've said here is easy to validate with a little research. The only downfall of this product is the cost. It's a lot cheaper to just blend protein powder, oatmeal and Udo's oil in a blender, but that obviously isn't nearly as convienent. All in all, this is a great product, but be sure to shop around because the price can vary greatly. …",18 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 Great to keep at work,4,"I keep these soup cups in my desk at work. They're really easy to make with the hot water from the water cooler. Be careful because the cup becomes too hot to hold sometimes. This is my favorite flavor from this brand line, though it smells funny to coworkers who aren't used to miso! I think it tastes great and makes a good snack or goes great with a sandwich or salad to be a lunch. The noodles are a great addition--regular miso soup is just too watery to be filling. The seasoning comes in a packet so you can use less and get just as flavorful a meal but have less salt in your diet. Note the nutrition info link at Superstore is based on half the package. I can't imagine anyone saving the rest for later, and 180 calories for the whole thing isn't exactly too much food! The cups I have purchased locally list it as one 180-cal serving so perhaps packaging has changed. Meanwhile I've had some cups seep a bit while eating them so it's not a container that's going to hold your soup longer than your mealtime. Put a napkin under the cup just in case. I give it five stars for flavor and convenience but only four total because of the details/execution (leaks, hot cup, half portion nutrition labeling). It also seems a little pricey at two+ bucks each in my local grocery, but it's much better than traditional Ramen. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful

" Great classic ""candy"" - great price - worth the buy!",5,"I've been a fan of these little things since I first discovered them on the local ice cream truck when I was a little kid. Since then, cinnamon toothpicks have gone in and out of fashion, and it wasn't until a couple years ago that this specific brand came back on the market... and oh, was I happy to see it back! While many of the 40-50 year old set fondly remember soaking toothpicks in cinnamon oil (the ""old fashioned way""), those in the 30-something set fondly remember buying pack after pack of these ready-to-enjoy treats. They taste fantastic - cinnamon with just a hint of sweetness - and are great to suck or chew on when you're on the computer, stuck in rush-hour traffic, or simply between meals and without a snack. Plus, well, they're toothpicks, so you can use them after meals and enjoy the nice, cinnamony flavor. Each packet contains somewhere around 10-12 picks, and they don't go bad when the pack is opened, unlike so many other candies. Plus, they have no calorie content and no food content, so while you get the flavor, you aren't gaining the pounds. All in all, they're a great thing to have around, regardless of the time of year... but given when I'm writing this specific review, I'd also like to add that they make great stocking-stuffers, or a great gift for the cinnamon-lover in your life. …",28 out of 30 users found this review helpful

" Delicious, Quality Popcorn",4,"I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Superstore. This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion. It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic. When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels. The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease. The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be). However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet. I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping. It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank! A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice. I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use! UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+! :o) I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels. I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare. I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.

 Seriously?,1,"This may look like a less expensive alternative to Roundup Extended Control, but here's the real deal: Roundup Extended Control: One bottle of concentrate (1 qt) makes 5 gallons and covers 1,500 square feet. It's advertised to prevent new growth for up to 4 months. In my experience, this is more like 4-6 months, even on gravel covered ground during the AZ monsoon season. Cost at the time of this writing = about $35 (but I've found it for less at a popular big box Home Outlet). Ortho Ground Clear: One bottle of the ""concentrate"" (1 qt) makes 1 gallon and covers only 75 square feet.

" Smells good, but tastes like coffee-flavored water",3,"These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces. It didn't help. I compared them to Senseo medium roast pods. The Senseo pods make a cup of coffee that is stronger but doesn't taste as good. I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee. I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides. As long as I'm having bad coffee, it might as well be organic and fair trade and all. So they are somewhat useful to me, hence three stars. Coffee maker: Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer Update: I stayed in a hotel with a small, cone-type coffee maker (not a Pod system).

 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",19 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 My cat actually loves it......,5,"...and he hates everything. I fed my cat Iam's for years, because his vet reccomended it and therefore I figured it must be the best for him, but after the cat food scare, I wanted to get out of all the traditional brands. The vet reccomended another brand, which I cannot think of the name right now... that you can buy at PetSmart. It was pretty pricey - about $28 for a 64 oz bag. My cat hated it, he refused to eat it, and it looked wooden.But I took him to a playdate at a friends and he has this habit of eating out everyone's bowl and came across Newman's Own in his friend's food bowl. He loved it! My friend sent me home with enough to transition him and I ordered a bag instantly from Superstore. And if you are looking to go organic with your kitty, comparatively, the price for Newman's Own is right. Much cheaper than those in the same class. …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Great tea at a great price,5,"This is an unexpectedly enjoyable tea. The mate gives it a deeper and woodier taste than black tea alone, with just a hint of smokiness. While that might not sound particularly appetizing, it's actually quite good. However, I ONLY like it with a squirt of lemon juice (and sweetener). Without lemon juice, I don't enjoy it, but I have to have lemon juice in my plain tea, as well. The flavor is distinctive enough that when I moved to a small town where the local store doesn't carry Morning Thunder, I didn't switch back to plain tea. I had to start getting multiple boxes on my periodic trips to the big city. I was delighted to find that Superstore now offers it at a price lower than most supermarkets. Having it delivered (for free with Prime membership or Super Saver) is the ultimate in convenience. I don't find this tea particularly invigorating (not that I notice, anyway, which is perhaps a good thing), but the mate does seem to live up to its reputation as an appetite suppressant. Whether it revs you up or not, it's a great way to get started in the morning. And with the astonishingly high level of antioxidants (due both to the tea and the mate), you can actually feel good about drinking it. Don't be alarmed by the six-pack size. It's a good enough tea that you'll go through it quickly. Each box is individually wrapped in plastic (as you'd get it at the store), so you can expect a long shelf life. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Great Pumpernickel Bread!,5,"As a European and an absolute rye and pumpernickel bread fan, I have always snapped up any of the Mestemacher brand variety in the local store. But it becomes increasingly hard to find. Superstore seems to be the one source that can offer such specialty items. My family and friends love it when I entertain with German dishes on special occasions and these make a great addition. Also, it makes more sense to buy these in larger quantities such as the one offered, as they can be stored for 9 to 10 months.

 Low. Low. I repeat: Low.,1,"I'm not stupid. I have nearly a degree from a major university. I read this description over and over, and still it didn't make any sense. Ten bars! Pack of two! Two boxes! Forty-eight! Hike! Like me, you'll probably be surprised by the dearth of product. You get two boxes. Each contains five packets. Each packet has 2 bars, sure -- but the weight of each packet is 1.5 oz, which is less than two-thirds the weight of ONE regular Clif bar. These bars are maybe 1 1/2"" wide, 4"" long, and 1/4"" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think. Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away. …",14 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Affordable Dog Puzzle!!!,4,"I bought this puzzle to help entertain my smart and curious and food driven dogs. My ""boys"" love it! We play it every single day. Often to work on obedience (sit, get it, down, get it!) and just for fun administration of treats and even dinner. My golden retriever loves it, but is a chewer, so he must be supervised with it. He pulled the cups out and thought that in itself was the reward... LOL but once I simply pointed to the treat hidden in the pawprint dish, he figured it out and was a happy camper. I also bought the spinner, which is actually my favorite of the two styles. I can get my golden's entire kibble allotment for one meal (we feed twice a day) inside it, so it slows down his feeding (so he doesn't gulp it down and get bloat). I know that my dogs love it by the perked ears and bouncing when they see me pick one of the toys up. They also sit and wait to be ""released"" to start their game. Great fun! The plastic is nice too since you can disinfect it easily or wash it in the sink without worrying about warping, splitting, or cracking wood like on the expensive models of similar toys.

 Cheap Great tasting BBQ Sauce,2,"I grew up with Cattlemen's then I moved to the other side of the USA.

" Great for like, everything.",5,"My bf and I both have subscriptions for this coconut oil. It's a great way to get it for an AMAZING price. I used to order the larger size and I was disappointed when it was unavailable for a while and I had to order the two pack in this smaller size (although really 29 ounces is not that small) but in the end I like it much better. With two smaller ones we can each have one if we end up running out around the same time otherwise, half of the coconut oil stays fresh and unopened. Oh, and if you want to put some on right after a shower, the smaller jar is more likely to actually fit in your shower. We tried other coconut oils and they were...well...gross. Really rancid tasting. We use this in deep dish pizza crust and the one time we used another brand we basically ruined two giant 14 inch pizza pies. We also use it for flour tortillas, pie crust, refried beans, smoothies, coffee cake, um, all kinds of things. I am planning to try using it instead of butter in a croissant recipe, although I expect it will be quite tricky since it melts at a slightly lower temperature than butter, and gets harder when it hardens. Put it in the fridge and it is hard as a rock. Anyway, we now use this stuff about as much as we use olive oil, and we've found it actually showing up in recipes in some newer cookbooks now, too, rather than us just trying to substitute and seeing how it works out. It does have a strong coconut smell and flavor, which enhances some recipes in a FABULOUS way, but may be detrimental in others. …",29 out of 30 users found this review helpful
 Bad  Tooth Tartar: all but gone,5,"I have a Rescue Weiner dog with teeth that had very bad tartar from front to back. Simply said, they were total brown. The vet suggested scraping which costs about $90.00. She sold me the large size (bag of 15 each) for about $18.00. Foxie the Weiner dog loves them. I also gave her Cow knees fron the butcher shop. (You can bake the knees to get rid of the grease and rancid smell.)The combination of the two has cleaned the dogs teeth remarkably in about thirty + days. She no longer needs to have her teeth scraped. I searched many internet sources for these products. With the $25.00 minimum Superstore supersaver shiping I saved about 45% off of the vet's cost and about 20% to 30% from many online vendor's.I saved $ by buying the large size, then cut them in half with a sharp knife or poultry shears.To keep you dog from vomiting the chew, use the large or extra large size.

 SUPER NATURAL SUGER SUBSTITUTE + TERRIFIC BRAND,5,"EXCELLENT SUGAR SUBSTITUTE HAS HEALTH BENEFITS + NO WARNINGS, This ""NOW Stevia powder"" is good stuff and this among the most economical and user-friendly ways to buy Stevia. WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT: Sweeter than sugar, that's what Stevia is, but that's not all. Stevia has been shown to lower blood sugar levels in research involving healthy adults by increasing the secretion of insulin making Stevia useful for diabetics. It also improves digestion and gastrointestinal function, and is useful for upset stomachs and to reduce gas and stomach acidity. Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart's muscle tone and promote the body's water loss. These properties are thought to contribute to lower blood pressure. Stevia also has antiviral, antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. It's used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss. ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE: There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research. FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States. AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT! Stevia can be substituted for sugar. It is a bit different tasting if one is use to sugar. I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as; 1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey. 2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar. 3]- Iced Tea. 4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup. MEDICINALLY SPEAKING: A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% ""steviocides"" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A. Duke, suggests in his famous, ""The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook"". ABOUT FORMS AND BRANDS: I prefer Stevia in powder over the packets, as I can better measure, and use what I need for each individual use. Purchase Stevia in whatever form you are most comfortable using. This ""NOW"" brand Stevia powder is an excellent product and a terrific value. ""Planetary Formulas Stevia Powder 3.5 oz."" is also excellent and it comes in a liquid as well. ""Swanson"" and ""Nature's Way"" are both excellent too, and have Stevia in powder, liquid and packets for convenient use. Any of the above choices are excellent, and I have used them all at one time or another, over the past 3-4 years on a daily basis.

 This is the new Ketchup,5,"I was going to High School in California about 15 years ago when a Vietnamese friend of mine INSIST that I try this. I'm pretty open minded to new kinds of foods so I gave it a try. ""Tongue Ought Shurocka?"" I said. ""DUDE!"" ""Not even close!"" he said as he laughed like hell. I still have no idea how to pronounce the name but it has been my favorite Hot Sauce ever since. Over the years, I have been seeing it pop up everywhere from PF Chang's & Applebee's to Firehouse Subs. If you like hot sauce or any kind of spicy foods at all, then you MUST try this. I INSIST. Imagine going through your entire life without Ketchup or BBQ sauce? Just take a second and actually think about how plain so many foods would taste like without them. ""The Rooster Sauce"" is like that. As you can see from the other reviews, it has about the same applications as BBQ sauce or Ketchup would have for a person who likes it hot. No other hot sauce that I have ever tried has the same texture, heat and most importantly FLAVOR as this one does. It brings out the flavor in nearly anything that you put it on, from the obvious Tacos, burritos, Chow Mein, Chili, Meat & Poultry, to Clam Chowder, fish sticks or even.. OMG Peanut Butter Sandwiches? (haven't done that one yet but it's probably ... interesting). Let me try to describe this to somebody who hasen't tried ""The Rooster Sauce"" before. First of all, unlike standard hot sauce, it has the texture of Ketchup or BBQ sauce which makes it cling to any kind of finger foods, chips, etc. perfectly. The taste is what is the kicker though. A garlicky, sweet, HOT flavor that is vastly different from anything else. Since it comes in a convenient squeeze bottle, it can be applied to anything, anywhere. This stuff is a god send when living in a world of quick, frozen, packaged, fast food which is dull, bland and virtually tasteless. This is also great for anybody on a special diet who wants to add some flavor to a very limited menu. As far as the Heat is concerned, let me warn you that this stuff is pretty darn HOT. It's made from Red Jalapeno paste so it's not ridiculously hot but it definitely has some serious heat. If you don't like hot, spicy food then this stuff probably isn't for you. On the other hand, a little goes a long way. Just a few drops add good spice and flavor. A WHOLE BUNCH ... may take a little getting used to. I've gotten to the point where I literally submerge things like chicken wings into this stuff. It will really make you sweat out those toxins. ""The Rooster Sauce"" would also make a good gift for the person who has it all. A few years ago, I was living all the way across the U.S. and my Mom sent me a bottle. It sounds silly but it was one of the most cherished items in my house. If giving it to somebody who has never tried it before, it may very well be like introducing someone to BBQ or Ketchup for the first time. In other words it's a thing that they will always remember. Now as far as complaints? Well as stated in another review, the cap can get a little bit gunky, so you may have to run it under the sink a few times to get it nice and clean again. Not a real big deal. The other isn't a complaint at all but because they don't use any artificial colors, the sauce can darken after a few months. It will go from the original bright red to a deep red color. I haven't really noticed a difference in taste though. Since this is hot sauce, you can store it unrefrigerated without worrying about it getting spoiled. I actually prefer to have the color change slightly then to have it filled with artificial junk to keep it looking nice. If you really have to keep the nice bright red color, then I suggest keeping it refrigerated. One last thing to keep in mind. This product is MADE IN THE U.S.A. In an economy as bad as this one, we need all of the help we can get. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Great Product But Not for Every Dog,3,"It totally makes sense that dogs are carnivorous so we should be feeding them a meat type diet. However, one must look at what their dog was bred for. Many of the toy breeds were bred to be companions and fed foods from their owners plates and pantries, so the meat theory doesn't really apply to such breeds. Such was the case with my Scottish Terrier/Chihuahua mix. I was all for the meat theory and tried to feed her this food but her little stomach just couldn't handle so much protein. It just seemed too rich for her. Also, her breath began to smell terrible! I've switched to another all natural/fit for human consumption type of dry puppy food and her stomach and system are back to normal. That being said, my daughter has an Airdale Terrier and feeds her the regular Innova dog food, is very pleased, and would never use anything else. This manufacturer certainly seems dedicated to producing all natural pet food with no by-products. So- good brand, high quality, but each dog is different and so are their dietary needs. I suggest always purchasing the smallest available size bag and testing it first (with any brand of dog food). …",12 out of 16 users found this review helpful
" Outstanding, Bold, Lively Sumatran. best of the K-cups",5,"First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine. Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being ""tangy"" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich. IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4. I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc. Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star. Stale and bitter. I will definitely stay with Puck's. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
