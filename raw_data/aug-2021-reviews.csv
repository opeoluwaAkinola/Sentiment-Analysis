 I LOVE this stuff,5,"I'd been buying it for years WHEN I COULD FIND IT, at the local grocery. Generally buying 5 or 6 cans cause I couldn't be sure it would be there next time I went. As such, I was thrilled to see Superstore selling it in bulk and cheaper than at my local store. These are almonds... so you get the health benefits of that. They are very tasty, with a mild wasabi tang... I've shared them with friends and they love them. Granted, these don't provide the entertainment value of the wasabi peas from the Japanese place that blow out your sinuses. But Its still a very tasty, semi healthy (lots of salt), snack that fills my need for something crunchy. MUCH healthier than potato chips. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 A major improvement in menopausal symptoms,5,"I tried this product after researching menopausal heart palpitations and internal tremors on www.power-surge . The relief was immediate! What surprised me was the improvement in many other aspects of my health. No more headaches that feel like a tight cap binding my scalp. Reduction of my migraines. No more nightmares (brought on by hormone fluctuations). No more ""internal earthquakes"" or buggy-crawling sensations on my skin. Less anxiety (formerly triggered by hormonal changes). No more weak nails. Monthly acid reflux greatly reduced, sometimes none at all. Greatly reduced frequency of colds, flus and sinusitus. I chose the Calm with Calcium since I am dairy allergic. My body assimilates it well, much better than calcium & magnesium pills, which had little to no effect on the above-mentioned problems (in ANY ratio). Overall, I feel much calmer & more energetic. Not a cure-all, but definitely has raised the quality of my life. I highly recommend this product! …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Healthful it is not,1,"Why would anyone want to add sugar to coconut water??? I mean, what's the point of spoiling it and making to it like all the sugary drinks out there. Can the American palate not tolerate anything that is all natural that does not have added sweeteners? I bet you that no one from the Caribbean or other places that coconuts are indigenous to would appreciate the alteration of this delicious water. We who are used to it do understand that the natural sweetness levels in each coconut varies, so some may be sweeter than others, and we are quite ok with that because it is natural. Please read ingredients people- not all coconut waters are created equal. …",7 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Cholestrol Dropped over 50 points,5,"I have been taking this product for the past 12 months. Not only is it simple to take and easy on the taste buds, but as you will read also much more effective than I ever thought it would be. In addition, I have been taking direct source of milk thistle and tudca powder, Milk Thistle Powder 25 Grams + TUDCA Powder (Tauroursodeoxycholic) 5 Grams . I am forty-two years old and exercise regularly and eat moderately healthy. I recently took a physical for a new position I acquired with a huge company and my total cholesterol was 149. I was completely taken off guard by hearing this number because the last time I had my cholesterol checked was three years ealrier and my total cholesterol at that time was over 200. I was 39 then, and in much better shape physically than I currently am. It is true what they say that the metabolism takes a sharp decline at 40, not joke there! I assumed my cholesterol must have been at least somewhat lower but I had no idea that such a drastic change would occur. I believe these Benecol Smart Chews along with the recommended dose of milk thistle and Tudca have played a big part in this incredible drop from a once 200+ cholesterol rating. I haven't grew any younger and my lifestyle is pretty much the same as it was three years ago (if not a little more relaxed) so needless to say, these are products I can highly recommend without prejudice. …",34 out of 34 users found this review helpful
" Designed to Sweeten, not to affect flavor",5,"I only see a single 3 star review for this product currently, and that simply doesn't do it justice. It exists as a way to sweeten Teas (and other beverages) without having a strong effect on the flavor itself. I am primarily a Fruit-based Tea Drinker, and its fantastic for sweetening a batch of Tea, Iced or hot, and has no trouble being turned into a simple syrup for later application. It is indeed on the pricey side, but its well worth it for what it brings to the drink. A fine product, through and through. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 The devil is in the details...,2,"Love these cookies. They taste wonderful. No trans fat, vegan, Kosher, healthy ingredients. So what's my gripe? If you look at the nutrition label on the back of the cookie package carefully, notice that a serving is 1/2 a cookie. And, 1/2 a cookie is 210 calories (different from the info on the Superstore site, but I'm looking at the package right now -- same product, current package). So, if you eat the whole cookie (I dare you to stop at 1/2. I know I can't! I tried.), you've eaten a 420-calorie cookie. Wow. That's a lot. Sorry to burst the bubble. I take one of these to work every once in awhile to eat for lunch (and 420 calories is a large lunch for me), but that's the only way I can eat them. I bought these not realizing they'd counted the cookie as two servings (which is pretty sneaky, IMO), and relied on the Superstore site info, which needs to be updated to reflect current package count. Great cookies, but if calories factor in for you, beware. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 70% Robusto,1,"The worst thing is that they do not list the fact this is a 70% Robusto / 30% Arabica blend. I do not like Robusto coffee at all. It has the taste of smelly socks. This is personal preference. Since this coffee did NOT list that it is a Robusto blend and had such great reviews from many people (who obviously like Robusto coffee) I purchased it.

 The Good and the Bad,3,"I've worked with different types of fondants and if you are reading reviews because you are new to the Fondant Cake process, here are some things to keep in mind: 1. Satin Ice is Yummier than most 2. Satin Ice is harder to work with than many 3. Satin Ice shouldn't be you're first ;) I started my Fondanting adventures using Wilton's, a brand that makes most professional cake decorators cringe. It isn't yummy, but it is forgiving. If you are new to cake-ing I would recommend using Wilton's the first few times to get the hang of things before moving to the more finicky fondants. If you start by using this fondant, you may be Freudianly misspronouncing it in a loud voice: ""I hate you SATAN Ice!!"" Really, fondant tears may stain your cheeks. Fondants I've used in order of easiest to work with: 1. Wilton's 2. Elite by Fondx 3. Satin Ice 4. Homemade Marshmallow Fondant's I've worked with in order of yummieness: 1. Homemade Marshmallow 2. Elite by Fondx 3. Satin Ice 4. (distantly) Wilton's I would recommend the tutorial on Satin Ice website, really great: [...] If you are only buying Satin Ice to sculpt edible animals, than this would be a great one. For first time cake coverings, try Wilton's, get things down then come back to Satin Ice. Thanks for reading and good luck on your cake adventures!

" Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Do not buy.",1,"I bought this on a whim at the store, intending to use it in risotto. I didn't think it smelled very chicken-y so I tasted it. It tasted nothing like chicken...it tasted like nothing I wanted to eat. Fortunately I had some ""Better Than Bouillon"" on hand and used that with water. I checked the Cooks Illustrated review of chicken broths - it was the lowest rated broth of 9 tested. One of the remarks: ""like an entire vegetable drawer gone bad"". I would agree with that.

 Choking Hazard,1,"Please be careful with this product. My pug almost died today choking on one of the dog chews. I assume that the larger and smaller ones are fine, but my pug who weighs about 16 lbs (within the 11-25 lb suggestion) could not swallow the chew and got it stuck in her throat (after she chewed it until the point when it got wet and pliable). Thank god that my wife and I were in the living room to witness the accident. My dog fell over in convulsions while choking and my wife physically yanked the chew out of the dog's mouth. I think that this sized chew is very dangerous and you should think twice before purchasing it. If you do have a similar dog and want to buy this product, please supervise him/her! …",14 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 YUMMY but Expensive!,4,"OK, I have to admit these are REALLY yummy, and they don't have anything really yucky in them. As a vegetarian family finding fruit snacks without gelatin (bovine source) is a tough job. And finding them without any HFCS, artificial flavors, and artificial colors is even harder. So, as far as taste and quality go these are great. However, they're REALLY EXPENSIVE! My 4 year old could easily eat a box a day if I'd let him, and so could I truth be told. At over $4 a box, that's pretty pricey for a quick snack that doesn't offer up any real nutrition. I know quality ingredients cost more, but jeez. Maybe if they offered a bulk pack or something, reducing the price AND the packaging, it would bring down the cost a bit. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Delicious Spinach and Potatoes,5,"Because I have celiac disease I must eat a gluten free diet, I'm also vegan by choice. This item meets both of those requirements and is also absolutely delicious. It is not spicy hot at all, perfect for typical western tastes, yet the sauce is very tasty. I've been using Tasty Bite products for years, as they have long offered gluten free and vegan items, but this is the best of all of their products I have tried. I eat it over rice and it causes me to have Happy Tummy, always good for people with celiac disease. The spinach and potatoes dominate, but I love both. It probably is not as high in protein as many other similar dishes, but not every meal needs to be packed with protein. I'd subscribe to this product if the option were available. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Just like what you'd get with McCormicks tiny bottle,5,"I am hooked on toasted sesame seeds. I toast them in my countertop oven and keep them in a small parmesan cheese shaker and use them on just about everything. I was paying over two dollars an ounce by buying the McCormicks one ounce bottles so you can see buying in bulk this way is a very good thing. Before I bought I was confused about whether I should get hulled or unhulled. After researching I decided I wanted unhulled and so I choose this brand because everything I get from Bob's Red Mill is great. When they arrived I was relieved to see they were just want I wanted, exactly the same as the McCormicks. I allow myself two ounces of toasted sesame seeds per week. A little goes a long way because the flavor is so intense. I wanted to make some hummus and although I know it can be tasty without tahini I decided (since I have so much now) to toast and puree some sesame seeds and used about two tablespoons of the resulting thick peanut butter-like paste in the hummus along with some olive oil. Best hummus I've ever made. Update - I see the product description now includes a statement saying that the outer coating of these seeds has been removed. So I guess these are hulled seeds then? I don't know for sure but they are just like what is in the one ounce canisters of McCormicks. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Truly Disappointing. Product Changed. Not for the better!,1,"We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible! Deserves 0 Stars... Update - a note from Caribou Corporate: Thank you for taking the time to contact us. We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band. The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans. We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you. Sincerely, Linda Caribou Coffee Customer Relations The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change. Oh, well.

 Awesome horsepills,5,"First off, I think the reviews on this page are confusing. It seems to me there is a mix of people who bought the container of oil and those that bought the pills. I bought the pills and am enjoying them very much. I read news reports on how coconut oil may help with Alzheimers, diabetes and diet so I thought I'd try them since I have issues with all of these in my family line. I feel more mentally focused and alert since I've started taking them a week or so ago. I definitely plan to continue to take the pills. They are large as many people have noted (see my photo uploaded with the quarter), but they are not any bigger than any other large vitamin. The pills, like other vitamins, do have a slight smell if you stick your nose in the bottle. But they have no taste, no after taste and no gross burps later. The bottle calls for 3 pills 3x a day. 9 seems pretty excessive for vitamins. I'm taking 6 right now, 3 with my coffee in the morning and 3 with dinner since I usually only have 1 or 2 meals a day. I would note that taking these has loosened some things up, you know -- down there. It's not an emergency bathroom thing but you probably will be flowing pretty freely when you do go. I'm assuming my body will eventually adjust and become more regular but it's not really bother if it doesn't. …",25 out of 25 users found this review helpful
" Finally, an affordable, delicious green tea powder",5,"I love drinking green tea. It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key. So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US. In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews. Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping. I was pleasantly surprised. The product works as advertised. It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too. The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter. It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Ewww gross,1,"My first review on Superstore, and It's a real downer. Ever since I walked over the the vending machine here in the office a few minutes ago and dropped my last 75-cents on Kellogg's Cherry Flavored Fruity Snacks, I felt compelled to log on to the first website I can find that sells these and give them a horrible review, and warn everyone and anyone about this poor excuse for a food product. They taste somewhat like plastic, and the ""cherry flavor"" is worse than the worst tasting cough medicine you can think of. These don't taste ANYTHING like fruit. These are supposed to be cherry flavored, but the word cherry appears no where in the ingredients (apple puree concentrate is the only fruit item listed), and the word ""fruit"" doesn't appear anywhere at all. They also pull that bait-and-switch telling you 70 calories per serving, but there's 2.5 servings in these dinky little 2.5oz bags. These are disgusting. It's been 60 minutes and I still can't get this taste out of my mouth. Next time I want something fruit flavored, I'll just eat a piece of fruit. Don't give these to your kids unless they did some horrible thing and you're planning on using these disgusting ""Fruit"" snacks as some form of punishment. …",6 out of 24 users found this review helpful
" No meat by-products, good and safe, Turkey & Chicken Dog Food",5,"Everyone knows about tainted pet food from China. Newman's Own is a branding that I can trust, and this one is a real winner. Newman's is what I would make if I were making it for my own family, as in you can trust that it is great tasting, good for you and safe to eat. I'm very pleased that the Newman's line was extended from people food to pet food. When it comes to moist dog food every single choice on the market has meat by-products except Newman's Own. My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety. In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too. While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog. One other finding: When you open almost any moist dog food you smell ""dog food"". When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat. It actually smells good. Imagine that. …",29 out of 29 users found this review helpful
 Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS,1,"We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb. …",8 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Tastes disgusting!,1,"I normally don't write reviews, but I wanted to spare others from tasting this chocolate. I was looking for an alternative to the Dr.'s chocolate (sweetened with xylitol), and so I ordered this product. Once I opened it, I ate two small squares of the bar. From the first taste, it was ok. It was the aftertaste that had me on the couch trying not to vomit, that prompted this review. It's taken about two hours, a few apples, and some melba toast to re-settle my stomach.

We rushed her to the emergency care for dogs and they checked her out completely. They could find nothing wrong. Her vomiting stopped. We will never give her these made in China products again.

 Great Bullion And Value,5,"I bought two bags of this along with some beef broth from the same company. Despite the negative reviews from a couple of folks here that it has MSG, and that it also contains chicken broth (really??....Duh!), I highly recommend this powder for its excellent value and rich taste. Since it comes in a powdered form it is much easier to personalize to your taste. It also contains a little less sodium than cubed bouillon. (For anyone that cares about that sort of thing). I don't make chicken soup every day, and hardly ever during the summer months. So when I do I want it to taste really yummy. And that means using the best tasting stock I can find. Unless you are someone that is either sensitive to MSG, or just chooses to avoid it, I highly recommend this chicken powder.

 Please check the controversial ingredients and decide for yourself,3,"While several reviewers have alluded to the healthfulness of this product, I think that we owe it to our beloved pets to pay closer attention and educate ourselves about the actual ingredients. The overall appearance gives an allure of wholesomeness to this product, but an item listed in the ingredients is actually controversial with regards to our pets' health. (And if you're considering this food good enough for your own consumption, please note that the ingredient is also potentially toxic to human organs). Here's the list of ingredients, from the manufacturer's website: Fish broth Tuna fillets Yellow fin whole loin tuna/red snapper/shrimp/sole Soy bean oil Trialcium phosphate Guar gum Calcium sulfate Carrageenan Vitamins and Minerals Vitamin E supplement Vitamin A supplement Vitamin D3 supplement Zinc Sulfate Thiamine Mononitrate Manganese sulfate Menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity) Riboflavin supplement Folic acid Pyridoxine hydrochloride Copper amino acid complex Iron amino acid complex First of all, it's great that the manufacturer has whole seafood as the major ingredients (as opposed to the by-products, meal, grains, etc). But there is one item which I would not have expected to find in something of this quality: Menadione sodium bisuifite complex. Menadione is a synthetic precursor for the K vitamins and has been reported, at high doses, to have toxic effects. Moreover, I had actually never seen menadione listed as an ingredient in other cat foods (though there seem to be others out there). A little bit of Internet sleuthing yielded some disturbing information, which I feel obliged to list here. *Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption. *There are safer alternatives to menadione for proper K vitamin-related functions (e.g. blood clotting). The use of menadione over the alternatives (leafy greens, kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. *A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997. *Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells. There seems to be a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of menadione in pet food: [...] Does this information mean that this food is bad for our cats, when normal doses are given? I don't know for sure, but I wish that I'd been more aware about this ingredient before feeding it to my cats. Admittedly, more research needs to be done regarding this subject. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I'm erring on the side of caution on this one. …",91 out of 98 users found this review helpful

" All it takes is one death, and these will be pulled from market",1,"We're pretty avid Whole Foods shoppers now, and have felt pretty good about purchasing organic baby food for our now 9.5 month old son. Earth's Best brand has been popular with him, so we bought these teething biscuits recently. Today, he could have died eating one. Although I'm an anesthesiologist, and half of my job is to ""protect people's airways"", one needn't be a medical professional to realize why these biscuits are dangerous. Most babies get their front teeth (upper and lower incisors) first, long before molars arrive. So, they're limited to biting with their front teeth, and only mashing with their gums (where their molars will someday erupt). These biscuits are great for the first 5 minutes, baby happily chomping away on the hard surface. Then, they soften. Pretty soon, baby bites clean through the biscuit with their front teeth (size of chunk depending on how far they had inserted it into their mouth at the time), and the chunk that remains in their mouth is WAY too hard to mash with gums. Baby has nothing to do but try to spit it out (difficult at this age), or swallow it whole (if lucky enough for it to be a small piece), or have it completely occlude their airway. We were able to quickly fish one large chunk out with our fingers, but our poor soon started gagging, tearing, and wretched once before something resolved (still don't know if he swallowed a large piece or if it ended up on ground), but not before we scooped him up and tried to knock it loose with some back blows. In any case, although the kids may love these, all it would take would be one infant death from choking to prompt a recall or something.

 Ummmm...white chocolate is NOT real chocolate....,5,"It cracks me up hearing people crying on here that the product ""doesn't taste like hot chocolate"". Well duh, that's because it's hot WHITE chocolate which isn't actual chocolate, it is the cocoa butter that is produced when cocoa is made, then it is sweetened and made into whatever. The result is a creamier, sweeter and smoother taste which is NOTHING like actual chocolate, so unless you are a fan of white chocolate and are expecting this to taste like real chocolate you ARE going to be disappointed. I am a a fan and love it and my K-cups, I have the platinum B-70 coffee maker so I can make a 6 ounce cup if I want it to be extra tasty or 8 ounce if I want it more mild. I would suggest giving it a quick stir as all the flavor can somtimes settle.

 Not the miracle I anticipated,3,"Sambazon Acai Powerscoop Powder 90g from Sambazon As a person with an auto-immune disease, where chronic fatigue is a major obstacle, I have navigated through many nutritional support options to supplement a healthy diet and when I first began to read about the Acai Berry, I was interested in trying it. I have used other anti-oxidant products from very dependable sources, and there is just no dramatic difference I detect with this product. Freeze dried Acai appears to be the most dependable formulation for delivery of the benefits of the berry, but I honestly noticed no change after a month trial. (I actually had to stop taking this product for a few days as for some reason, perhaps attributed to the pH of the supplement, I found the product worsened my gastritis). I give the product three stars, because I do believe that for some people, they may see remarkable results, but I certainly did not. I still believe that this product is worth a try, for all the reasons that the Acai Berry has the potential to yield wonderful changes in overall health. It just did not do it for me. Good luck to those who choose to try this. I would recommend this brand because of the preference of the freeze dried state to hold onto all the nutritional ""miracles"". Don't get succored into cheaper brands. The nature of a complicated illness may or may not be a factor that determines clinical outcomes. Healthy supplement options are at times only as good as the Company that makes them. I do believe that the Acai Berry is a very important food souce. Besides the wonders of its potential health benefits, it is a product that ensures the preservation of the Superstore Jungles. On the flip-side, the less we eat hearts of palms which comes from the same tree and literally ensures the destruction of the tree to harvest the hearts, the better. …",26 out of 41 users found this review helpful
 The premier bulk sweetener,5,"Erythritol is the bulk sweetener that the sugar free food manufacturers should be using. It has many advantages over the ones most used by the manufacturers such as maltitol, sorbitol, mannitol, lactitol and xylitol. First, Erythritol has only 5 calories per ounce while the others have between 40 and 90 calories per ounce. Also, Erythritol has a glycemic index near zero while the others can be as high as in the 50's such as maltitol syrup. A low glycemic index is highly desirable as it does not cause an insulin spike which is a problem for those of us who are prone to overeat. Also, and most importantly, Erythritol has a far better laxation threshold than the others. For the uninitiated, this means that one can eat twice (or three times) as much erythritol as the others before having to go to the bathroom. Some of the candy makers used to use Erythritol in their sugar free candy bars but they stopped and substituted maltitol. Hershey foods in particular should bow their heads in shame as they had the best product made with Erythritol and ruined it with maltitol. The new maltitol laced product has more calories and is more likely to cause the ""Runs."" I sometimes think the candy companies are in league with the toilet paper companies. I use erythritol to make my own sugar free candy along with a good brand of unsweetened baking chocolate (e.g. Callebaut, Valrhona) along with some fiber such as inulin or polydextrose. If you do not wish to make your own candy with this product you can find some excellent ones on the internet that use Erythritol such as choco-perfection bars or chocolite bars. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Excellent odor control and soft on the paws!,5,"I bought one bag each of the micro crystals and the Pearl crystals by Ultra Pet. Having used Fresh Step Crystals since my two cats joined the family over a year ago, I didn't want to shock them with the switch so I tried the Pearls first as they are larger crystals. I layered the Pearls with a thin carpet of Fresh Step crystals and they seemed to take to it well enough. The odor control was equivalent (superb) to Fresh Step which is a big thumbs up from me and the two ""boys"". After finishing that bag, I went to the Micro Crystals. Before I could even start to put a layer of the Fresh Step on top, one of the cats leaped into the box and basically started dancing around in the litter. I don't know if it's because of the sand-like quality compared to the hard, rough crystals but he was literally having a ball just spinning around in the box. I guess it took his brother shoving him out to go do his business for the first one to figure out it's not to play in! All in all, both products I tried were superb quality and highly absorbent with long lasting odor control. I'll be purchasing the Micro Crystals because it's easier on MY feet considering they do tend to throw this all over the floor before they ""go"". It's unfortunate that there's a 3 week shipping delay and there's no subscribe & save option. If not for those issues, I would make the full switch over to Ultra Pet litters. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Great taste - poor packaging wastes k-cups,3,"I love the taste of this coffee. But apparently they have poor quality control. These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly. You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to. Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem. It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens. I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them. Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing. …",116 out of 128 users found this review helpful

 My tips for making this system work,5,"We have 3 long haired cats and have tried every litter box under the sun that promised ""no tracking"". This system is the first that truly delivered. WE still get a few pellets outside the boxes but they are easy to pick up with our hand vacuum. We've been using the system for 4 months now and here are some tricks we found to make it work. We find that Pet Fresh (made by Arm & Hammer and usually used for carpets is a BIG help in keeping the odors under control. It's really cheap too.) 1. Right after they go number 2, we sprinkle Pet Fresh on it. This is because one of our cats doesn't cover his poops after he goes. The scoop works best after they have a chance to dry out a little. 2. The loose stool issue. It can be a real mess trying to get them out with a scoop. I found that using paper towels or toilet paper to pick them up is the easiest and cleanest way to get them out. 3. The pan that holds the pads starts to retain the smell of urine after a month or 2. Solution: Sprinkle Pet Fresh on the pan, then put the pad in the pan. 4. Issue: the sides of the pan start to smell and poop gets stuck to it. Solution: We keep Wipes, paper towels and spray cleaner near the box and wipe the box and scoop whenever it gets dirty. 5. Expense: We have found that if we look out for coupons and sales we can get the pads for about a dollar each and the pellets last a month in each box. We used to change the litter ever week and went through so much that we have found this system to actually be cheaper. The worst place to buy the pellets and pads is Petco - they are triple the price. Best place for us has been Target and Stop & Shop - we stock up when they are on sale. 6. Transitioning: It took us almost a month of increasing adding the pellets to the old litter. Every time we scooped the old litter we added more pellets. The whole time we had the new system right next to the old one. By the time the old system was almost all pellets they were using both so we got more breezes and got rid of the old. We did have a couple times where they went outside the box, but that was it. It wasn't easy to change, but to not have litter and urine tracked all over the house is such a god send that it was well worth the trouble. My greatest fear is that they might stop making the refills! I was glad to read that someone said you could use the system without with the pads if you dump the urine every day. That would be not be ideal but it's nice to know it works. I was also thinking you could use doggie pee pads if necessary. As for the pellets, I'm going to try ""Yesterdays' News"" pellets and see if they would work. or may even tiny river rocks that are washable? washable pellets you don't have to replace would be awesome for the environment. Trouble is they won't get to make as money off them - but I""m going to be on the look out for something that works! …",51 out of 51 users found this review helpful
 An Excellent Food,5,"Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on. I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13.

 deadly,1,"1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous and Deadly, May 25, 2006 I have two beagles who love to chew, and greenies are highly compressed which woule make it a good optionfor my dogs. However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any. It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse. If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a ""busy ball"". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy **** let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety. If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie. Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly. While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies. I am actually surprised Superstore even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to Superstore users to petition them to stop selling it. …",1 out of 32 users found this review helpful
 Fantastic quality grain free product at good price,5,"I've done hours and hours of homework on high quality, grain-free dog foods. From product analysis, kcal analysis, ingredients, customer reviews, professional reviews, company recalls - all of it... I have become a mini-expert in the field. I was pushed into becoming an expert because my yellow Lab kept having seizures and I couldn't figure out the source. I finally learned it was her food, which was the most expensive store bought brand my local Sams Warehouse carries. I thought I was giving her the best, it looked fresh and rich, but it turns out it was just absolutely terrible food. My black Lab also had terrible skin allergies, to the point where I would get a small rash on my skin if he laid next to me on the couch for more than 5 minutes at a time. I had no clue it was because of the food. But it was! Since having that epiphany and learning so much about dog food, I've always made sure to feed them the highest quality grain free food I can buy. This Taste of the Wild (TOTW) fits the bill very nicely, and they love it. Since switching to a grain free diet, the yellow lab has not had any more seizures in over a year, and the black lab has the silkiest coat you've ever seen and his skin allergies are completely gone. They are on 2/3rds dry and 1/3rd wet combination. Contrary to what I had previously been raised to believe, a wet diet is not bad for dogs but in fact is superior! I use the combination to save money while providing them the best I can. Before deciding on TOTW, I had also tried Blue Buffalo, Wellness Core, and Orijen. Briefly: they are all good foods, but my labs were happiest on TOTW and my wallet is also happiest on TOTW. I also believe TOTW has a better formulation for them and their life style (some of the products, like Orijen, are simply too rich for the average household dog, despite being made of the best ingredients available). Enter TOTW. The dry food is dark and rich, with no sign of crumbling. The kibble is a good average size. The wet food has nice chunks of meat and the right amount of gravy. I use the wet food as a topper to mix the 2/3rd dry and 1/3rd wet together for their meals. I use one whole can of wet per meal with my pack, which is convinient so I don't have to store it in the refrigerator - btw, never store canned dog food in the fridge in the original aluminum container! I still wish I could find a less expensive product with the same quality, but in the mean time, TOTW is the best choice for my pack. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Give it time,5,"I adopted a dog that was raised by a bunch of frat age boys. You can imagine the diet she had; Burgers, fries, ice-cream, and the cheapest dog foods on the market. No, she wasn't crazy about Newman's dog food when I switched her to it. But if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense. It takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there. It has been almost a year. My dog, Molly, is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free. She gets dry Newman's fed free style, and 4 ounces of Newman's canned every day. Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week. On another note, this diet has made doggy duty much easier. She never vomits anymore. Her scat is always firm, making her easy to clean up after. She is regular as clock-work.

I snack on them at work and re-hydrate them in tea before adding the mix to a tall bottle of ice and fresh lemon juice. I have a subscription to Navitas on Superstore. I got my first bag. I found the fruit very hard and dry but decent in size and still a great snack until I kept having to spit out mouthfuls due to the distinct nasty taste of mold.

I ordered Dragon Herbs Heaven Mountain Goji's and will follow up on how they are. Dragon herbs is a reputable company that has a process for dealing with the issues facing Goji's travel from China. If anyone knows a locally grown organic source of Goji's that is reasonably priced, please list it. Goji's grow easily in the US and it's obviously more sustainable. Regretfully, I am cancelling my Navitas subscription. Beware when purchasing. I read other reviews about mold and you can't return this item. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Not recommended after they changed their formula,5,"I started feeding my dogs Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food almost 5 years ago. Prior to that I used NutroMax. Wow, what an amazing food. My german shepherd and 2 golden retrievers have the most incredible coats. Their poops are firm (and easy to pick up) and nearly odorless. No allergies either, unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems. I've convinced one person to change to Canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it. I buy it locally as I go thru 40 pounds every 3 weeks (feeding 3 large dogs). I highly recommend this food, could not be happier. Update: Canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late 2008 and at the same time, in order to save money, changed their formulas. Added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and GI problems. The organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about Canidae than any manufacturer in recent history, due to their formula change. A fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about 50% of the Canidae bags back from owners w/ pets having problems w/ the new formula. All 3 of my dogs had bad reactions, and I even did a gradual change over because I was told ahead of time (by my friend) that they changed the formula. Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, scratching. My one golden scratched himself raw to the point I had to take him to the vet. After using Canidae for many years, and recommending it to many others, I decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it. I switched to using California Natural Lamb and Rice and Orijen Adult, two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available. Both company control the ingredients, manufacture the food, have numerous quality checkpoints, and do their own distribution. My dogs are different ages and have different needs so I do a blend of the CalNat and Orijen and WOW, what a difference. Their coats are shiny, their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free. And they love it! Both are great foods, a bit more expensive than other foods but to me, worth every penny. Cal Nat and Orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion. If you are considering Canidae, I'd recommend you look at Cal Nat or Orijen instead.

So if you look at other reviews of Manuka honey exported to the United States, you have to wonder whether or not this is the traditional Manuka honey sold in New Zealand. Maybe North American sugary sweet-loving sensibilities preclude us from buying the harsher tasting dark Manuka honeys.

" Great value, good pantry staple",4,"I really like this product. I find they soften in as little as 10 minutes or so. I simply sort through them and pull out the kind of mushrooms that I'm after (either porcini or chanterelles, for instance). The best part of using dried mushrooms is using the flavored water that the mushrooms steep in, such as pasta sauces, risotto, etc. I never throw it away. As to other people's comments about dirt or rocks, this is my second jar and I have never encountered that. Like dried beans, you should visually inspect the dried mushrooms before you add them to recipes; sometimes the steps do not revive well and stay tough. In general, reconstituted dried mushrooms do have a chewier texture. I encountered this when drying my own mushrooms. Some of this is just the process, not this particular product. I went to Italy last year and bought several packages of dried porcini and some of them were a bit chewy, too. You do get better and fresher dried mushrooms if you buy them in small quantities, but they are much, much more expensive. I use for Italian mushrooms for special occasions, and use these for my everyday cooking. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical,1,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands. This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi. Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering. The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much. While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal. Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products. Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money). Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer. One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer. Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail *Concentrate Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99 Liters of product per container 12 Flavor/l $0.42 *Carbonator Volume of CO2 130 Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99 CO2 cost per liter $0.23 *Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter Equipment cost $89.00 Equipment life (years) 5 Discount rate (cost of money) 8% Liters per month 10.00 Monthly amortized cost $1.80 Cost of equipment per liter $0.18 *Water Cost with Brita Filtration Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004 Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95 Brita cost per liter $0.0373 Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377 (assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration) ***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2 SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73 Without filtered water: SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65 *****What does CO2 Really Cost???? THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW *Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit) weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2 cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35 CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams *Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation losses: 10% available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85% net accessible CO2 of total: 77% usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams *Output carbonated liters of water: 2,479 cost per liter in USD$: $0.014 *SodaStream Output SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product) Cost per refill: $30.00 cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231 *SodaStream Markup Economics ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534% math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing This is an incredible 1500% markup Pros Saves plastic Allows flexible mixture of flavors Cons Cost of output is not compelling Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit ***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times. At the time of this review, I did NOT have an investment in SodaStream either short or long. In the past, I have both owned the stock and shorted it (bet against it).

 Total rip off,1,"I'm surprised no one has noted how much water is in the package and how little fat (only 1.4%). This Weruva flavor, for example, has 85% water (only 15% dry ingredients). Here is what the FDA says on its web site: ""It is especially important to look at the moisture guarantee for canned foods, even when comparing a canned food with another canned. Under AAFCO regulations, the maximum percentage moisture content for a pet food is 78%, except for products labeled as a ""stew,"" ""in sauce,"" ""in gravy,"" or similar terms. The extra water gives the product the qualities needed to have the appropriate texture and fluidity. Some of these exempted products have been found to contain as much as 87.5% moisture. This doesn't sound like much difference until the dry matter contents are compared. For example, a product with a guarantee of 87.5% moisture contains 12.5% dry matter, only half as much as a product with a 75% moisture guarantee (25% dry matter)."" On top of the nutrition problems, Weruva is ripping you off on a cost basis (this is my comment, not the FDA's). Looking at the dry ingredients, Weruba is charging you about $2 per ounce ($1.60 per 0.825 oz dry ingredients in a 5.5 oz can). The top premium cat foods charge about $1 per ounce of dry ingredients. Avoderm is 80 cents per 1 oz dry weight. Science Diet is less than 70 cents per oz dry weight. So Weruva is nearly 3 times the cost for ingredients other than water comparing Science Diet. So if you have a lot of money to waste and don't mind your cats having dry hair and other skin problems from lack of essential fats in the diet, then go for Weruva. Otherwise, wait until they drop their price and increase the fat content. …",17 out of 28 users found this review helpful

 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",38 out of 40 users found this review helpful

Suddenly you are alone on a cloudy, grey day, on a construction site for a new hospital. The hospital is nearing its completion but is obviously unfinished; blue tarps hang in place of drywall in some areas and fiberglass powder is scattered all over the bare concrete floor.

" IF you like this, just try tasty east Soy Jerky",1,"First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And, we found out it has granulated garlic, possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to ""spices"". Here it is part of the ""vegetarian spices"" ingredient. The company does not seem very forthcoming. Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available. Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them. This tasty eats soy jerky is the best tasting and what more, no onion or garlic powder in any of their product line. They are rated 5 of 5.

 More Uses for Baking Soda,5,"Arm & Hammer Baking Soda can be used to clean countertops, sinks, and appliances. It can be used to deodorize the refrigerator, closets, car interiors, garbage cans, and food coolers. It can be used to help clean the laundry. It can extinguish small grease and electrical fires in the kitchen. The use of baking soda for antacids is effective, but it should be used only rarely. Any persistent indigestion requires medical attention. What is ""indigestion"" could be a cardiac emergency. Also baking soda has a high sodium content. It can be used to whiten teeth. Some people use it for deodorant. A small amount in warm water makes an excellent gargle for a sore throat. It can be used to deodorize carpet and upholstery, but it is important to check for colorfastness in a small spot first. We use it for cooking. My mother used it in her peanut brittle. I remember how it used to foam when she added the baking soda, and her recipe is in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook My friend Cathy uses baking soda in her delicious crawfish cornbread, and her recipe is in The Collard Patch When we cook collard greens, we often add a tiny little pinch to the collards - only 1/8 teaspoon to tenderize the collard greens.

 Amazing Cake mix,5,"I was completely surprised when one of my customers brought this cake mix to me to use for their wedding cake, I made it and it was wonderful.

I tried mixing in different ways, according to package directions and also separating the eggs and beating the whites and folding them in as the final step in preparation. It was an effort to see how much height I could get. Beating the whites separately did give a little more height, but all in all I determined it was not worth the extra trouble. It is wonderful as it. I used one mix in a 10 inch square pan, baked three layers and stacked them. It made a very tall, nice, rich brownie-like cake.

 With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility,1,"It should come as no surprise to anybody reading this review that bacon has a well deserved, and nearly cult like following. Whether it be a highfalutin' cut of pancetta or some good ol' American pork belly bacon, that entire family of cured meats garners a lot of love. It is with a heavy heart that I can not in good faith continue believing bacon makes everything better, for jerky has on this day sullied that Utopian meat dream. Generally as I approach a new food item I'm openly forgiving of its appearance based on the old adage of not judging a book by its cover. Looking at this vacuum pressed mass of grease and what only vaguely represents bacon in a nearly cartoon like sense of thinking about it, the very foundation of my foodie philosophies faltered. This stuff looks repulsive, there's really no kind or candy-coated way about it. The meaty bits have the look of rancid meat and the generous slabs of fat look almost marshmallow-like. To say it was an unapproachable off-shoot of bacon as you know it would be putting it kindly. The smell is about what you'd expect, oily aromas and heavy spicing. This remains as possibly the least offensive attribute to this product short of the cheerful pig on the sticker attempting to assure you that nothing but porky bliss lie herein. Oh you jolly pig, your insidious smile will forever haunt me. Taste. Taste can me a lot of things to a lot of people. Some people swear there is a right and a wrong as to what makes food good but I have no qualms with somebody that prefers a McDouble to a juicy steakhouse burger. Different strokes for different folks I say. Alas the taste of this product, I have unequivocally deduced, is wrong by all standards. Knowing full well some people love to eat bugs, gristle, brains, and all manner of foods one wouldn't suspect could be edible, let alone enjoyed, I find it impossibly difficult to imagine there could be a soul alive whom would find satisfaction in the experience that is Bacon Freak's Bacon Jerky. The meat has the texture of marrow mixed with space ice cream and the fat goes down like one could imagine snacking on packing peanuts would be like. Granted the texture alone could probably be saved in capable hands but the overwhelming blend of spices which I can only closely describe as being that of a gritty cut of smoked fish puts this experience to rest. At this juncture you'd hope for the end but bacon jerky likes to hang out a while and make itself at home in your mouth for substantial amount of time. Almost worse than the initial undertaking is the trials and tribulations of aftertaste you will have to endure. With a taste that floats between regurgitating brisket and a bad case of salad dressing acid reflux, you will beg for nothing short of the sweet release of death. Attempting to wash the sin out of you mouth with a selection of beverages only added new layers of head-spinning nausea to what had already become the most regrettable thing I had eaten in living memory. Don't do it. My fellow man/woman I can not wish this on another soul. This gift will be laughed about but not loved. As a personal challenge, or fulfillment of bacon loyalty, this will only leave you as a remorseful husk of a person who's perfect image of bacon will be besmirched. Having read this should you choose to pass this on to an enemy then you are truly diabolical, a foe not to be meddled with in the future to be certain. You have been warned. …",11 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Original Idea---Kombucha from a Tea!,5,"***** This Organic Green Tea Kombucha from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so. I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Green Tea Kombucha is based on an ancient remedy and offers a convenient form of Kombucha designed for daily use. Legend has it that some 2,000 years ago, Kombucha originated in Russia, and from there it traveled to Japan. Since then it has been used to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach. This special healing formula is made with Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis), which is organically grown and, unlike other green teas, has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. Green Tea has excellent antioxidant properties. To it we have added a concentrated purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm), which is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea, and is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs. The recipe is complemented with Organic Spearmint, which can help to relax the body and aid digestion; Organic Licorice Root, to support the adrenals and enhance the effects of other healing herbs; and Dong Quai Root, a well-known tonic. Once the benefits of these ingredients are released by hot water, you are ready to enjoy a delicious, delightful and soothing cup of tea - and one that is naturally rich in antioxidants and other health-supporting qualities."" Yogi Tea's use of ""Kombucha-Pure"", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha. Note that Yogi Tea also makes a decaf version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea is decaffeinated---naturally, of course! Highly recommended. ***** …",54 out of 60 users found this review helpful

 Toxic Hexane in Formula???,1,"To be honest, I have never written a review, not matter how good or bad a product I received was. I never had the time and never bothered. Today, I write my very first review of a product that I have been feeding my precious son since birth. He is now 2 years 4 months. I could never breastfeed him exclusively due to bone density loss and I did massive amounts of research and tried out tons of different brands before deciding on this organic formula from Earth's Best and since then, even though he is now a toddler, I still use the Earth's Best infant formula and supplement with other child vitamins. I was trying to re-order again in bulk from Superstore when I noticed for the first time the controversy over DHA/ARA extraction by the use of toxic hexane of which Hain Celestial which manufactures Earth's Best is guilty of. To understand my utter complete fury, you must know that I live in Singapore and I quite literally pay international shipping for every can of this formula (and wade through customs declarations, tests and tax levies) to bring this milk to my son. In Singapore, this can of milk is also available but in highly limited quantities and even more princely prices (yes, even after the tax, customs and shipping, it still costs less than US$68 which is the going price per can here). Calls to Hain Celestial customer service drove me further up the wall when first, a lady said the hexane was only in trace amounts and less than what the FDA approved. Then, reaching another lady an hour later, the story was different. She said that the hexane solvent method was the only method approved by the FDA to extract the DHA/ARA from non-toxic algae and soil fungus. A third occasion and Hain's customer service informed me that there should be no hexane detected in the product but on further probing admitted that she was not aware if the formula had undergone independent third party tests. To me, this is crazy. The formula was marketed as a pure organic product and we pay premium prices (especially me!) for a premium product. To find that that they have taken such short cuts is completely unacceptable and the worst thing is that, it turns out that most of the other organic formula companies do this exact irresponsible thing and keep quiet about it. The only company that does not is Baby's Only - it uses a water based process to extract their DHA/ARA from eggs(compare this to Hain's claim that the hexane method is the only one approved by FDA and one wonders why Baby's Only hasn't been hauled up by the FDA yet). My son is going on that pronto once I can get a shipment to Singapore. Unfortunately, Baby's Only is not available in Singapore (not even at princely prices) and my son is going to have to continue ingesting his Earth's Best formula in the interim. …",436 out of 486 users found this review helpful
 What a gift!,5,"Perceptions about this innovative box of flowering teas and accompanying teapot range from ""Buyer Beware"" to ""Gift of the Year."" Here's my take: The Good: 9 tea selections that are unique in bloom, taste and fragrance. Each bloom yields 3 pots of tea. Lidded Glass teapot to view the spectacular blooming. 2 attractive, reusable and sustainable bamboo boxes (1 containing the individually wrapped flowers and a larger containing the whole kit and caboodle. Superstore's price, which at wholesale is a steal for this type of handmade, artisan product. And the sensory experience itself is priceless (though many a tea salon now have put a price on it). The Bad: All selections do not quite yield 3 pots, and speaking of the pot, yes you may want to invest in a back-up. For the price, I haven't seen a better gift. The nay sayers are looking for a product that would have to retail at twice the full retail value of this set. And you don't like the flavors? Isn't that a matter of personal taste? It certainly isn't a reflection of the tea quality, which is very good. To add to your experience, enjoy with friends and afterwards flip through The Tea Box by Gilles Brochard. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Very good baking mix,5,"I am very pleased with my order of Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Baking Mix. I love the 16 oz packages. They are small enough to use up one at a time while the other packages remain unopened (also easier to store). The flavor is also great, and I can make quite a few recipes with it. My favorite recipe being the low carb pancakes, the recipe is right on the package.

" You change Your Honey, You Don't Get My Money",1,"I have been consuming and sharing with others Wedderspoon Active 16+ for almost two years. Then Wedderspoon made changes that I find unacceptable. The first had to do with their label, which most people don't bother to read since the label color didn't change. Gone was organic certification by Ecosert SA. Gone was ""Support the OMA mark which guarantees honey that is free from chemicals and pesticides."" Missing are the following: Never feeding the bees sugar, area of forage is 5 km. from intensive farming, Ecosert approval. Added was the word ""harmful"" before chemicals and pesticides. Obviously, chemicals and pesticides are added and we are supposed to hope they are not harmful. Then I noticed that batch 110576 was definitely ""watery"" compared to earlier batches. It had nothing to do with the weather because last summer was just as hot and the manuka was just fine. Batch 110583 was almost as runny as 110576. Then came another shipment from Superstore that was packed very securely, but there was leaked honey all over the box. Superstore reimbursed me, but it wasn't their fault. The outer seal was intact but there was no inner seal. This runny honey had no difficulty passing between the jar and the cover. Additionally, although it no longer affects me, it appears that Wedderspoon followed through and no longer sells direct to Superstore , which raises the price a little more. I rated this product one star so I could submit my review. One star is very generous. …",34 out of 48 users found this review helpful
 This milk makes our baby really sick!! :(,1,"Sorry to give this 1 star. but this milk really makes our baby really sick!! :(, literally!! if your baby can take it, I guess it's a good one but for us, we had the worst experience with it. Here is our story. My baby had been solely breastfed. After 9 months my wife was running short of her milk. She didn't have enough breastmilk for the baby and he didn't take as much solid food as we would want him to. We gave him Similac Advance, it was recommended by the hospital. First Similac Advance Liquid, he threw up 9 times within 2 hours after half an hour of feeding. That happened twice. A few days later, we tried Similac Advance power, he threw up again! This time 5 times plus serious diarrhea for 5 days. He has lost 5% of his weight within 2 days. That's really bad. We were desperate. We took him to the hospital twice that week. The doctor though it was stomach flu. However, I didn't quit agree with him. What a coincident that 2 different formula milk feeding incidents would throw my baby off balance. I'm a computer engineer and dealing with solving and debugging problems all the time. I was firm with the doctor that this was not a coincident. I thought it might have something to do with the protein in the formula that my baby couldn't digest. We decided to try Lactose free formula (Nutramigen from Enflora). It smell and taste really awful (my wife tried it and she gagged. As we thought, my baby rejected to drink it. Then I tried Good Start soy. Same story, smell bad but not as bad as Nutromigen. My baby also rejected to drink it. Now we were really desperate, not enough milk for him and he doesn't like to eat solid food!! He would throw up + diarrhea if he gave him normal formula milk. Phone call to 4 advise nurses, no luck! I finally search on the internet and found a lot of similar story to what we experienced (including this on Superstore reviews). I decided to give it a final try, crossing our fingers really tight. Good Start Gentle Plus is our last hope or my baby would not have any more milk to drink. He's losing weight!! And then miracle happened!!! This milk works wonderfully for him. The only complain I would have is that it doesn't smell as good as the normal cow milk-based formula, however, doesn't smell or taste awful like the other two. My baby didn't quite used to the tasted in the beginning and didn't really want to drink it at first. So we tried mixed it with breastmilk for a few days. Now he is a happy baby, gaining weight, doesn't throw up and used to the taste of it. My wife and I are now happy again :) …",2 out of 23 users found this review helpful

" Having just eaten this for dinner, I have advice and raves",5,"First of all, don't be put off by the price. If you've kept track of grocery store receipts lately or the sharp increase in basic foods over the last year, you may see how this product could save you time, gas and MONEY. At the time of this writing, it cost about $16.88 for four packages of this mix. EACH package easily serves 8-16 people with soup left over. While the instructions note to add 4 cups of water or a water and broth combo, we quickly discovered we had to double or even triple the liquid added. No problem there, because we had more soup! If you don't have fresh veggies or spices around, this will suffice as is and it is thick and satisfying. If you garden, you'll improve the taste by adding fresh chopped parsley, garlic and whatever veggies you want. A can of tomatoes (or fresh, chopped ones) does no harm. This is a mix you can play with, add ingredients and spices. IMPORTANT: this is not a salted mix. It is full of split peas, barley, lentils, whole wheat pasta, dehydrated spinach, tomato, onion, etc. If you don't use salt, consider adding a salt substitute. I also added basil. It was delightful, quick and is now a pantry staple. Nutrition: 330 calories (1/2 cup) only 20 calories from fat. Significant source of iron at 22% of the Daily Value. Protein: 20 grams.

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",33 out of 48 users found this review helpful

 How Could You Be So Bold,5,"After FINALLY purchasing best coffee maker I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Superstore, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold. Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold. What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's. There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Superstore. Wake up people, and add this to your cart.

Satin Ice shouldn't be you're first ;) I started my Fondanting adventures using Wilton's, a brand that makes most professional cake decorators cringe. It isn't yummy, but it is forgiving.

 Diabetic testimonial,5,"Being a type II diabetic is challenging when it comes to desserts. Concerned that I was consuming too many products using artificial sweeteners and while researching some other products (allergic to stevia and agave), I came across the SweetTree Blonde evaporated palm sugar which claims a glycemic index of 35. My body has had positive gylcemic reactions to sesame and coconut products and I made the purchase on faith that the glycemic load using this sugar versus artificial sweeteners would be similar. I made a batch of cookies using Splenda and another batch using the SweetTree blonde sugar and then tested my blood glucose. I did this repeatedly over the course of about 7 days and was pleasantly surprised that my blood sugars in both cases were consistently within a few points of each other. So, for my body I found this sugar to be just as good a substitute as splenda. For my money, I would rather put something in me that is closer to nature.

 Vegan Natural Kosher Choice,5,"Vegan. Natural. Kosher. Beautiful, classic yellow dal. Dal means lentils which have been split in half, similar to split peas and split pea soup. Yellow dal is a staple of Indian meals (thalis.) Not spicy, but very rich and flavorful. In addition to serving with or over rice, great with bread or toast. Jodhpur is a city in Rajastan, India located southeast of New Delhi. Raja means king. Rajastan is also well known for the high percentage of orthodox Hindu vegetarians living there. Made with lentils, sunflower oil, salt, tomatoes, garlic, cumin, tumeric, and chilis. Easy-open foil pouch. Approx 220 calories, 12g protein, 5g fat per pouch. Labeled vegan on the back of the box. By using only vegetable oils, this wonderful treat also lets Ama Gai [mother cow] save her milk for her own babies.
