" I never met a fruitcake I didn't like, until now...",1,"CLAXTON FRUIT CAKE (3lb.) Superstore REVIEW Credit cards are weird. I mean, you wann 'em, and if you play your cards right over time, you gott 'em. But ahh, the catch. If you don't use 'em, you might just lose 'em. What's all of this have to do with fruitcake? Well, sans any fruitcake jokes, please stand by... Recently, I've lost a couple of hard-earned credit cards, due to ""lack of use."" Really? I mean, really?!! Is this what America has come down to? I do all I can to establish or re-establish my basic U.S. dollar, human worthiness for unsolicited credit card offers, only to get a few, only to lose out when I don't use them for awhile? Without warning. ZAP! They're gone. Seems ""they"" want you to have the cards, but if you go overboard with them, they hound you to no end, but then, if you don't use them, or even forget you had one, they cut you off and cancel your card. Fruitcake, I say! Fruitcake! So it was, after I learned these things and more, that I told myself, with one card, hey, I better USE this or LOSE it. Having nothing really I wanted or needed at the time (all you NEED is love...), I ordered this product from Superstore. Through one of those cards I feared losing soon, unless I used it. But after ordering, receiving, and trying this particular product (some supposed ""gourmet"" fruitcake), I can only report that this was/isss overall, much less than I expected. In other words, this is pretty bad fruitcake, in my opinion, and for the price, really bad. If you are at all in my situation, I strongly suggest that you use any under-used credit card funds or other ""disposable income"" on something else. Cause this is pretty bad fruitcake. Now, before you cut me to the quick, and question either/or my knowledge and experience of/with said fruitcake product, let me just say that I've been getting fruitcakes as gifts (usually around Christmas), for a long, long, long, long time. Ever since I care to remember actually. I think I remember that once upon a time, I casually mentioned to family, friends, or others, that I liked fruitcake. I actually, generally LIKED fruitcake. Well, soon the word spread, and I've been given them by family, friends, or other over the ages. Not that I'm complaining, because I DO LIKE FRUITCAKE! There, I said it all. But...this particular fruitcake brand? Fairly average at best, but compared to the cost, pretty awful. Oh, believe me dear readers and followers, I WANTED to like this. I really did. An impulse buy at the time, all I wanted really was some half-decent fruitcake and an inexpensive means to keeping a credit card alive and kicking. Well, big, impulsive mistake, because, according to my taste, and my own decades-long relationship with fruitcakes in general, this is not very good. And it is only my history of loving almost EVERY fruitcake I've ever had, which guides to you, my fellow fruitcake lover, away from buying anything more than a sample of this product. And please don't make the mistake I made when I ordered taste-unseen, three single fruitcakes, when the purchase of even one would've told me the story here. I realize with this review that I may go against the grain (though not fiber-wise) in dissing this, but I'm just coming from a long history of fruitcake enjoyment and this doesn't even come close in quality, taste, and otherwise, to fruitcakes enjoyed past, present, and future. Heck, this isn't even ""cake"" at all. It's like this big, thick, DOUGH, with TOO many TOO sweet ""fruits,"" and the nuts were pretty dry and unmemorable. Heck, I don't even LIKE sweets generally. I'd much rather have a bowl of cheese crackers or chips than a bowl full of M&M's or Reese's peanut butter cups or chunkey monkey or any other such sickenly sweet thing. But heck, just about the ONLY sweet I've ever really loved, was/is fruitcake. So, why was/is this so disappointing, and so overpriced? I think this is the fruitcake equivalent of fruitcake DOUGH. Like cookie-dough ice-cream, which I've always thought too weird and not really concentrating on the essentials. This is like eating fruitcake DOUGH, before any baking. And that, ain't good. Fruitcake should be CAKE, not uncooked DOUGH. And that's what this is really. In the end, wholly unacceptable, and to go technical on you'all, pretty darn yucky, you betcha! Only my opinion...try a sample before ordering anything more than that. Judging by the generally favorable opinions about this specific fruitcake I've found here on Superstore, I may never know if this is just me, or what. This has generally high reviews, but I only managed to finish ONE of the THREE individual pounds I ordered and was sent (and btw, Superstore delivered nice and fast and easy as usual), and was just gonna GIVE the rest away, but I think I would've felt guilty about subjecting anyone else to this, so I just threw the other two pound ""cakes"" away. Maybe the rats or worms will like it, I don't know. Basically, to make a long, boring, but hopefully humorous story short, I suggest buyer beware on this, and buy/try the smallest portion/size you can. If you like this thick, tasteless in many ways, un-fruitcake, by all means, purchase away. But I can't give this any kind of enthusiastic thumbs up, as far as fruitcakes go. And wouldn't ya know it, the instructions for use are virtually non-existent, with no manual, no software, and little documentation as to why and how I'm supposed to actually enjoy this doughy mess. And no real warranty! Fruitcake lover/buyer beware... To all fellow outcast, strange dog, hopelessly romantic, secret fruitcake lovers, my small minority brothers and sisters who KNOW good fruitcake from bad, let me just say that this is nowhere near worth the asking price. To those of you who've tried this and actually liked it, I can only suggest you expand your fruitcake worldview and experience to other brands because this just ain't that good. A cheap dollar store variety is better than this, IMHO. One thing for sure though, next hardly used credit card purchase goes to another gift card for someone else, for something other than such a bad product as bad as this... …",3 out of 16 users found this review helpful
" Skin, Bones & All",3,"You want all natural? With this product you get it. The quality and flavor is excellent-- after you pick out all of the bones and skin etc. At first glance it looks like catfood or bait, but looking past all of this there is excellent salmon caught in pristine Alaskan waters. I don't know that it is worth paying extra for something simply because it doesn't have salt unless you are on a salt-restricted diet. There are larger cans available at the same price in which you have to pick out the bones and skin. All-in-all.

" Great nuts, almost no duds",5,"I love pistachio nuts. So I tried these since the price was good and I am always looking for good products at low prices. I wasn't disappointed. Out of the two jars of nuts, there were less than 5 duds (dried out or bad tasting nuts. There were less than 25 nuts that were not split open so no need for a nut cracker. The rest were very good to excellent in taste, ease of opening shells and amount of salt on them. The only problem was, I couldn't stop eating them so they only lasted less than a week. 3 1/2 pounds of pistachios in less than a week. I sure will be buying them again, but will wait a couple of months and eat pistachio ice cream in the meanwhile. Jewel Foods now has their own pistachio ice cream that is better than Ben and Jerry's and only costs $2.99 a half gallon instead of $4.50 a pint for B&J's. Just as many WHOLE pistachios in the ice cream (unlike the ground up ones Hagen Das uses) and the ice cream itself is creamier and better tasting than B&J's. …",24 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 This is the REAL Coca Cola,5,"I bought a couple bottles of this from a local gas station (Michigan) the other day. The owner told me it was bought from Mexico. I tried it side by side with locally distributed Coca Cola, and noticed it tastes like the Coca Cola I remembered as a child. The local Coca Cola does not compare. I attribute the difference mainly to the use of cane sugar in the Mexican product. The aroma of this product is better as is the taste. The greensish tinted bottle gives it a nostalgic feel, but it is the taste and aroma that sold me. Additionally, the local product was overly carbonated, perhaps to have a longer shelf life. If you are looking for the way coca cola used to taste, this is it! …",23 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Pricey Sack 'O Nuts...No If's And's or Butts... But Buy Them You Must!,5,"I have reviewed these macadamias several years ago and I am updating my review based on recent frequent purchases. I have purchased macadamias from literally every growing region on the globe, including South Africa (Planter's), Costa Rica , Australia (Trader Joe's) and Hawaii. Nothing, and I do mean nothing, has the fresh, intense, buttery and unique aroma of Mauna Loa macadamia nuts. Other macs all taste mealy, bland, tasteless or rancid, including most generic store brands. The rich, volcanic soil of Hawaii continues to produce the finest macadamias on the globe in my opinion. If you are a distinguishing connoisseur and aficionado of the nut, you must have them or face serious withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, despite the purchase of Mauna Loa by Hershey Chocolate Corp. in 2004, the availability of Mauna Loa products, particularly on the East Coast of the U.S. remains challenging. This is because of increasing global market demand, shelf space limitations and slotting fees charged to supermarkets and other retailers to stock the items and recent unfavorable climate conditions on the Big Island. Mauna Loa has had significant price increases since 2010, particularly with the 4.5oz canned nut products. However, these nuts are still worth every penny if you purchase them fresh. I have since switched from purchasing these in the 4.5 oz. ""6-pack"", to 11 oz. pouches with Superstore's ""Subscribe and Save"" Subscription, because they are a bit cheaper and there is no additional charge for shipping. Mauna Loa has finally embraced putting easy to read Best Buy (""BB"") dates on its products and this makes it easy to insure that you are getting fresh product. I hope I have made this an easy nut to crack! Happy Munching. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 GMO corn produced,1,"This stuff comes from China and Cargill, king of GMO foods. Emerald Forest xylitol is also from China even though it's advertised as American birch. Now, it may have been birch at one time but Xylitol Canada bought them in 2010. An employee at EF spilled the beans and I listened on the phone as she got chewed out by her boss. Even without that little confirmation, the chances are certainly slim that EF would produce real quality American Xylitol when they are in bed with Cargill.

 VERY USEFUL BAKING PRODUCT FOR DIABETICS,4,"This product came in most handy due to my big appetite for a slim person and I am a diabetic of about 1 1/2 years now Type 2. It became very useful for me to be able to make my pumpkin bread, cocoa bread, as well as experiment in making other baking goodies with this products. The vast majority and I mean vast majority of baking ingredients such as meal, flour, breads, i.e. are so so loaded with carbs and diabetics are limited to the amount of carbs one can eat during a meal and throughout the day. This product ""gives back"" ways of baking and making things now that we cannot eat anymore, should NOT eat anymore and if one does a very limited and very small portion!

 Why would anyone buy these?,2,"I bought these to try out based on good Superstore reviews which made them sound like some kind of wonder bars that were healthy and would make you happy for eternity (or something). I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain: These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like ""gluten free"" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat). In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients. Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing. …",2 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Not pleased with these K-cups,2,I was so excited to receive these K-cups and had one today. I wasn't very impressed.

 Nong Shim won a ChefsBest Award with this flavorful ramen,5,"If your only ramen experience was a dry, tasteless brick dumped into a pot of bowling water that you purchased six for a dollar, then you are in luck. Once you try a Nong Shim noodle bowl you will never go back to Nissin Top Ramen. Nong Shim delivers a flavorful instant noodle meal, balancing seasoning and spice for a perfect lunch on a cold, winter day. The noodle bowl has a rich, red broth that is visibly loaded with spices. I've recommended Nong Shim to many people but a few, because of the kimchi flavor, have been hesitant to give it a try. I can attest that Nong Shim's noodles are not as pungent as `fresh' kimchi. I submitted two product photos. Please give them a look. One shows the ChefsBest Award and endorsements Nong Shim received. Nong Shim is the leading brand of ramyoen (ramen instant noodles) in South Korea. I recommend adding refrigerator scraps to your noodles; perhaps, whole kernel corn (for sweetness) or some tofu, finely chopped green onions (scallions), chopped, cooked beef, chicken or seafood. An egg is another delicious addition, either hard boiled and chopped or over easy. One final note: a serving is high in sodium, so skip drinking the soup if that is a concern as the noodles themselves contain little sodium. You can reduce your sodium intake by more than 60 percent if you don't drink the soup. Rating: Five stars. …",21 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Organic endocrine disruptor!?,1,"Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household.

Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment. Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.

" Grain-free, & the protein isn't too much too handle",5,"**Update: March 2012** I still feed this grain free kibble to my shelties, they still love it and I'm still very happy with it. I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids. For some reason, my younger sheltie's tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn't have gas at all. Woohoo! So now I'm able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to. I think I've been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy. By the way, buying directly from Superstore for this item says ""Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks"", but 1-2 days after I order I'll get an update email from Superstore saying something like ""Good news - We're able to ship this sooner than we thought! Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered."" And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering. **Original review** I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Superstore has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety? My younger sheltie has epilepsy. Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet. Canidae is only part of that diet; I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4"" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals. The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies. I know, it's complicated, right? But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this. I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty. I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had **** gland problems where she'd have an **** sac blowout at least once a month. So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed. (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.) Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has **** gland issues. Their teeth are cleaner too. I didn't want this to turn into a ""raw food is the only way to go"" preaching session, I swear! But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her **** glands work like they're supposed to. Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does. However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it. If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food. For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food. The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles. I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid. So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS. I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it. The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right? I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do. As I write this, Superstore's price is the same as my local natural pet store. As much as I'd like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it's a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Superstore.

 Product not as described,3,"Package arrived in time. I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery. The salt was more like rock salt - the crystals being slightly larger than what you find in kosher salt. I have to dilute it with water before I can consume it. If you sprinkle it on a salad or similar semi dry food, you will feel the crystals, which is an unpleasant experience because it feels like you have sand in your food. This salt is not like regular salt that dissolves easily with little moisture/liquid. The package it is in is also labeled ""finely ground"". I use it for cooking - where I have no problems with it.

" The Truth, According to CSI:Snapple",4,"I'm tired of products that promise more than they can deliver. Advertising should tell me what to expect in the real world, not in some happytime fantasy land where money grows on chia pets and all my pants fit and supermodels frolic on the shores of the lazy Guinness river. I bought this product specifically to test the claims made in their marketing. The ad wags at Snapple tell us their tea is 'made from the best stuff on Earth'. Fair enough. But saying so is one thing. Subjecting a sample of their beverage to rigorous scientific scrutiny using an industrial mass spectrometer, it turns out, is something else entirely. I called in a favor from a friend who works at a molecular testing laboratory, and we got to the bottom of Snapple is indeed made of. Apparently, the component analysis identified compounds consistent with natural substances -- like those in tea leaves and peaches, for instance. However, the analysis did not find ANY discernible traces -- at parts-per-billion sensitivity levels, mind you -- of Cuban Cohiba cigars, Miles Davis' Birth of the Cool, or the dancing outfit Salma Hayek wore in From Dusk Till Dawn. So it's clear -- nay, it's scientific *fact* -- that Snapple is NOT made from 'the best stuff on Earth'. But for tea -- sure, it's pretty tasty. …",13 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Not as good as it could be (misleading ingredient label also),1,"A number of us earnestly tried this product but after trying another brand, found this to be wanting very much. With that said, there is a company making soy jerky that has better flavor, texture and quality. They even make jerky that is unsweetened. Most importantly, this company tasty eats does not have any garlic or onion powder in any of their products. This was the biggest, we felt, downfall of this product. Except this company, every jerky company; except tasty eats which uses no garlic or onion powder in any of their product line, all would list garlic or onion if an ingredient. The primal strips company has ""vegetarian spices"" so one is not clear what this is. Even the company, after phoning them, are rather reticent about saying if their is granulated garlic or onion. But there is. In these primals strips, all are having some form of garlic, possibly onion. We found tasty eats soy jerky to be Perfect.

 My favorite green tea!,4,"The pouch is vacuum sealed and holds about 100gms of delicate, deep-emerald, leaves. I use about a tsp for a 12-16oz cup. It is very important to avoid using boiling water if you want to get the full benefits and flavor of this tea. Water at a rolling boil will overcook the tea and you will notice that the tea quickly turns brown in the cup. If you adhere to directions and use water at 80 deg. C., you will be left with a wonderful cup of GREEN tea that stays green. I absolutely love the fresh, grassy flavor of this tea and it is a wonderful pick-me-up. The first sip of this tea leaves a distinctly sweet note on the tongue even though there is no actual sugar in the tea! I have spent hundreds on different teas, but I keep returning to this one as my staple. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 BUYER BEWARE!!,1,"I'm terribly disappointed in this product and here's the reason why. The front of the containers I received (and the photo of the item being sold by Senyx) read CRYSTALLIZED LIME and LEMON. I've purchased True Lemon from my local grocery store and the carrier sweetener was cane sugar...that's what I was expecting with these two products. Unfortunately, I now have two products that are primarily MALTODEXTRIN (a starch generally made from corn and probably genetically modified corn at that); and the ingredient labels on both items also state the products contain SOY. MALTODEXTRIN is a food additive...a filler...an artificially created sweetener! I HATE artifical sweeteners. I doubt these shakers contain very little crystallized lime or lemon compared to the amount of maltodextrin. What I do believe is that this product is primarily maltodextrin flavored with lemon or lime oil with just enought bits of crystallized lime or lemon to be FDA legal. I accept that I should have researched further before purchasing this product. That is why I won't be returning the items; but I'll NEVER buy them again. My trust was misguided. My purpose for writing this review is the hope of educating anyone else from making the same mistake. I wasted $17.89 and in this day and time...wasting money is NOT advantageous. …",6 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Very very tasty snack,5,"Attracted by the packaging, I purchased a bag [of the Classic Sea Salt flavor] in a local 'gourmet market'. At 110 calories, I suspected that I had been, as frequently happens, fooled by the 'serving size' (you know how it goes, 2.5 pieces = a 'serving' - so there are actually 7 'servings'/bag) BUT, NO, what a pleasant surprise - 110 calories was for the WHOLE delicious bag! They're non-greasy, light as a feather and unexpectedly filling - I almost couldn't finish the bag. I noticed they were produced here in NY, which I also liked and, after going online to find out more about them, decided to splurge for a case [of 1 oz. bags] to try all the varieties. One ounce doesn't sound like very much but they are so light that it is actually a very full bag and definitely more than enough for a single serving. (The 3 oz. bag contains substantially more then you would want for just one person) Favorites so far are: Honey Mustard & Onion Vintage Cheese Classic Sea Salt I don't have kids but I expect these would work extremely well as a lunch box addition. My only suggestion to the company would be that it might be a good idea if they made them available for purchase in smaller quantities. I'm afraid many people will be put off by having to purchase in 12- & 24-bag sized cases. But, if you do decide to purchase, I also have no doubt that you'll have no trouble sharing them with friends and will probably be back for more sooner than you expected. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful

I couldn't even push a butter knife into it. I could only scrape some off the top, to taste it. So I did what I was told in the directions: ""Place jar in hot tap water for 5-10 minutes & thoroughly stir."" 30 MINUTES LATER there was little liquid sitting on one side. That's 30 minutes with boiling tap water running into a small bowl where the Coconut Manna was immersed. I'm not sure what use we'll find for this, but I don't see the sense of liquefying it every time I want to spread a little on toast. MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.

" Best tasting ""cardboard"" I ever had . . .but not any more!",1,"** This review was done for the old formula - see update below for review of the ""improved"" formula ** Last year, I stumbled across a website that evaluates your current breakfast cereal for nutrition, satiety, etc. and this cereal was at the top of the recommended list as an alternative to my former option. I've always found that original Special K left me more hungry and the suggested serving size was laughable. The artificial chocolate pieces in Choco. Delight were vile, so with those strikes, I was a bit reluctant to try Protein Plus. It didn't help that some reviewers didn't like the taste - ordering 4 boxes that I'd be stuck with was uncomfortable, but I went for it. That was nearly a year ago and this has been my ""go to"" cereal ever since. I think it tastes pretty good, so I advise that you decide for yourself on taste. It has a light and sweet cinnamon flavor, I love the added protein and it's very low in sugar (2 g's per .75 cup serving). The flakes are sturdy (great crunch) and dense - not airy at all - holds up well in skim milk or yogurt, but I typically eat it straight up - out of my handy measuring cup. I don't need to sweeten it at all and a serving size, or just over, leaves me satisfied (really hard to do) and a box seems to last me awhile - another huge plus. I even carry a bag as a snack - especially when I travel - so that I'm not tempted to make less healthy choices. While I can't give all the credit to Protein Plus, as part of an overall reduced calorie daily intake attempt, I've lost 20 lbs in the past year - and although near my goal - have no intention of taking this off my grocery list. **Update 8.5.12** - the formula and stats have indeed changed, and significantly IMO. I am not thrilled and I wish they left well enough alone. Examples: Calories from 100 to 120, Sugar (now the 3rd ingredient) from 2-3 to 7 grams (double - really?!), fiber and protein same, but the old box claims 5 grams of fiber when the fine print says 3. The new box just has 3. Other stats have changed too, I just don't have the old box available to refer to. I am eating the new boxes since I have 4 from Subscribe and Save, but I got no warning of the change and there is a huge difference in texture, sweetness, etc. Overall, it tastes okay, but it lost its edge. I have cancelled this S&S and I am going to look locally to see if I can still find the old formula and stock up. Big fat BOO to Kellogg's - other than the easier opening inner sack,this was a stupid move. If I could choose no stars - I would.

I have a bottle from another company and it's been in my fridge for like weeks. ZICO's ingredient: 100% coconut water. :) Nice job ZICO. And I like the packaging.

 They all love this food,5,"We use this kitten food for our feral kittens that come to us for some loving. They all enjoy this food, we haven't had one yet that doesn't dig right in. The smell isn't too strong either, even the sea food one. For the more wild kittens we find this food is a great ice-breaker to get them to start eating when they are still scared. Many of our kittens (and the mothers) come to us in poor condition; low weight and more worms than cat it seems. They fatten right up on this food, and you can see the difference on a daily basis. When they get their worm medicine, they will often get sick and throw up their food. This stuff also doesn't smell too bad then either. Just so you don't think this is a post written by a company rep. :p For some of the smaller kittens we get, we also mix in meat-based baby food. Mix it all together with some water (they never seem to drink enough), microwave for 8-9 seconds so it isn't too hot and serve it. My wife and I love watching the change in the cats as they grow into their bodies. We also use this food for older cats that have weight issues, such as those caused by renal failure (loss of appetite, upset stomach, dehydration). It's a moist food, easy to add water to it, and they seem to respond well. When they start to turn away from this food, we know the end is near since it's hard to get them to eat anything if they don't eat this. For pricing, we often find it cheaper at local stores. And, oddly enough, the single cans are frequently on sale well below the price of the 24-box price-per-can.

 Titan Loves his ZiwiPeak Venison!,5,"This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain. More on that later.... Some background: My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier. He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband). He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food. Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison. Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Superstore. I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...). So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats. Titan went mad for them. It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares. You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky. But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw. Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door. He barely lifted his head from the bowl. For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France. When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure. Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine. Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept. When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet. I added a little canned venison to entice him. No go. Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating. Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there. Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag. Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag. I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time. The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO! But back to my point: I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!). So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain. And, it is high quality. Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam? Titan's never had that with this stuff. I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up. So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line. I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!). I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well. …",18 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 Know What You're Drinking and Use with CAUTION,2,"Celsius drinks claim to be ""negative-caloric"", which is to say that you actually burn calories by drinking it. Hmmm. . . Sound too good to be true? Well, of course it is. It's low-calorie because it's made with Sucralose (Splenda to the average consumer) and it promotes weight loss because its a combination stimulant (taurine) and diuretic - so basically, it works on your body like any over-the-counter diet pill. That said, the Raspberry Acai flavor does taste pretty good, but it will be up to the individual to decide whether or not any potential benefit justifies the downside. Unlike many other reviewers, I actually liked the taste - I thought that it was a smooth blend of green tea and berry flavor. However, there is just enough of that artificial tang at the end to tip you off that it's sweetened with Splenda. But the absence of any fizz or overly harsh flavors made it easy to drink - which is good because it comes in full-size cans and leaves you feeling pretty full (i.e. just shy of bloated) afterward. So is it any energy drink or a diet aid? It's a little of both. Most of the crucial ingredients are lumped together into a single line item (i.e. their secret, proprietary mix), but taurine is listed and the caffeine content is obvious. I found that while Celsius could beat back an afternoon energy swoon, it didn't really make me any more alert or focused - just instantly awake, albeit in semi-zombie form. This effect came on quickly and did last for a couple of hours at least. Now for the bad news - the ""crash"" effect that a lot of these drinks try to pin on their competitors was overwhelming with Celsius. As a little bit of background, I'm a grown adult in good health and am very caffeine-tolerant. However, during my testing of this product, I made the mistake of drinking two cans about three hours apart and ended up unable avoid my first all-nighter since college. I was completely awake and pretty functional throughout, although I wouldn't have operated any heavy machinery at the time. But by the morning, I was suffering headaches, muscle twitches and even a flutter in my chest. I'm completely sure that this was all temporary side effects of the outrageous amount of stimulants and not permanently harmful, but it was still enough to make me wary from that point on. So, the bottom line is this - if you're looking to occasionally avoid getting sleepy mid-afternoon at the office, or if you need to stay up late once in a while, Celsius may be an option for you to try. As a prolonged weight-loss regimen, I wouldn't take on the potential health risks in order to grab at some too-good-to-be-true advertising come-on. There's still only one way to lost weight and keep it off, and it ain't fun and it ain't quick, but it works: eat better, eat less and exercise more! …",13 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Review on TASTE,5,"I'm writing this review, because it's exactly the kind of review I was looking for before I bought this product, but could not find anywhere. When I first started using Natural Calm I bought it in the Raspberry-Lemon flavor, thinking it sounded the best and used it with water (usually just put it inside a water bottle and shook it up to mix it and drank it that way). Both me and my husband used it and HE really liked the taste, but for me this stuff tasted BAD. I don't know why, but I did not like the taste at all. I guess some people do (obviously my husband did or at least didn't mind it) but I definitely did not. It made drinking it everyday a CHORE. So, this next time I decided to try the one that isn't flavored and I like it SO MUCH better, like a million times better. I just mix it in with my blueberry-pomegranate juice and it's great! It is virtually tasteless and just adds a little 'fizz' to the juice that I actually LIKE. I also put it in teas as well. I wanted to write this review just to let people know that not everyone loves the raspberry-leomon flavor (and I didn't think I'd like the orange to begin with, but haven't tried it yet and probably never will). There are a lot of reviews claiming it tastes great... but for me not so much. I recommend the flavor-less one. Also, be careful when starting out to use the recommendation on the bottle and start with 1/2 a teaspoon a day and then work up from there. :-) I never had any negative side effects, but I guess some people get diarrhia if they take too much in the beginning. This stuff really is amazing and will help you feel GREAT! :-) If you're thinking about trying it don't hesitate. It has many, many benefits. You might just be using it to help with mood or to help with ADHD/concentration, or just for a natural way to keep from becoming constipated... There are MANY benefits. But no matter what you're using it for, it's bound to help out your body and mood in other ways as well! :-) Can't say enough good things about this product! Just try to get the flavor-less one first, it's so much better!! I hated having to drink it when we had the raspberry-lemon one. But now I definitely don't, and like the little fizz it gives my blueberry-pomegranate juice & teas! :-) Drinking it right now and loving it!

Yes they really are that good. I'm not in thrall of the whole ""organic"" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil. The person who came up with this ""red hot"" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented. It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.

You will definitely not be disappointed. This company has excellent customer service to deal with and the items always arrive ahead of schedule. I will definitely be ordering from you for my future purchases. I am a very satisfied customer. …,14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Tastiest mayo ever,5,"Because it has MSG. People are vastly over-concerned about MSG: it's a very small percentage of people who may have a legitimate reaction to the stuff, apparently. Consider that the Japanese put it in tons of their food, and it's all over our food too (anything made with bouillon, for example). This is the best mayo. It makes everything it touches delicious. Sometimes I have to force myself not to buy it because we end up putting it on everything, and I worry at the thought of consuming that much mayo (ie, for fat and cholesterol reasons, but msg concerns). Try this, you'll be hooked. …",20 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 Vegan Organic Kosher Choice,5,"Vegan. Organic. Kosher pareve. Very mild. Was interested to try this chili because I especially like barley in soups. The light chili use, mild tomato, barley, and great northern beans make this chili a more white-style chili, as opposed to some chilis that are reddish from lots of chili powder or darker browns from kidney beans. Easy on the tummy. The partially pearled barley is somewhat chewy. Made without texturized vegetable protein (soy) and with maitake mushrooms. I like chili with penne or other shaped pastas, over organic rice, or alone with pitas or any kind of toast. Very mild mushroom flavor note. Hint of spiciness. Great choice for those who prefer a soy-free choice with mushrooms. Great combination of organic ingredients. Also can be used as a base for your own chili by adding more diced fresh veggies, tomato, chilis to taste, and spices. Add water with the added ingredients and simmer to your desired consistency. Made with organic great northern beans, organic barley, organic tomato puree, organic brown rice flour, maitake mushrooms, organic onions, organic chili peppers, sea salt, organic red bell peppers, and organic spices. Labeled vegetarian on the bisphenol-free can, but is also vegan. 400 calories, 18g protein, 2g fat per can. Happiness arises from supporting what one finds to be good.

 The ONLY energy drink that works.,5,"I discovered Redline by accident and am glad to this day that i did discover it. I have tried every energy drink on the planet and non work, I'am able to drink 5 Redbulls and still feel nothing. Redline on the other hand WORKS!

If you ever need a quick energy rush Redline is for you, sip it over time to get an intermediate energy hype or slam the bottle and in about 20 minutes you will be bouncing off the walls and will not be able to stop. The only problem is if you do slam it after about 2 hours you'll crash pretty hard, but to counter that drink a lot of water and eat spoon fulls of peanut butter (not joking).

 Finally...I am in love!,5,"I have never written a review before, but I am so enamored by this product I wanted to share my experience. I have two cats, and litter tracking has been a problem for years. For health and dust issues I stopped using clay litters a long time ago, but have tried everything else. Any of the crystal litters were hard on my cats paws and not scoopable. I love the pine litter, but tracking was a major problem. We have a covered litter box with an internal ramp. When they came out of it, they step onto a litter mat that was grated and captured litter in a tray below. They then walk across a fleece mat to capture more. And finally, they move through a kitty door (a nice sized hole in the closet door - the litter box is housed in the office closet) where there was another blanket. We did as much as we could, short of personally washing their paws each time they exited the litter. It didn't matter. Within hours after daily cleaning and vacuuming the floor would be a mess again. We had litter everywhere, even beyond the room the box was located in. It became a joke - a frustrating one. We love our animals, but the litter was a huge problem. About a month ago I came across the Green Tea Litter, and tried it. AMAZING. Happiness, bliss and wonderment hit immediately. It is comfortable for the cats paws, easy to scoop, better at covering the smell, and DOES NOT MAKE A MESS! The daily cleaning ritual of the floors has ceased. It took years for me to find this solution, I hope to save you some of that time by writing this review. …",40 out of 42 users found this review helpful

" Tasty, gluten-free oatmeal",5,"This oatmeal is the only kind that I have found to be gluten-free. It is tasty and cooks quicker and has better texture than rolled oat varieties of oatmeal. The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter in 2004 with lab analysis showing that McCann's had significantly less gluten on median than two other brands; unfortunately, the analysis also showed that one of the four samples of McCann's had high gluten, so it's possible that there may occasionally be bad batches, or it's possible that they mixed up their sample of McCann's with the other brands since the other three samples were so different. The World Health Organization's definition of gluten free is less than 200 parts per million (ppm), and the more conservative definition is less than 20 ppm. The four samples of McCann's had gluten contents of: &lt;3 ppm, 12 ppm, 23 ppm, 760 ppm. The second brand was around 100-200 ppm. The third brand was around 300-800 ppm. McCann's is clearly better.

 Awesome quality cacao nibs - powerful and satisfying.,5,"I'm a certified chocoholic with a weight problem. I had heard that cacao nibs had all the health benefits of dark chocolate (way more, actually) without the sugar and junk food aspects. They are loaded with antioxidants and have those powerful endorphin releasing stimulants. They are also quite high in fiber (but also in saturated fats). I got my big pile of Navitas Naturals nibs and dug right in. Well - these are a bit of an acquired taste; but once acquired, they really satisfy. Cacao nibs are broken pieces of raw whole cacao beans that have been dried (and that's it). They are brown, with a dark cocoa smell, and a seductive texture that's partly like a coffee bean (crunchy and hard), and partly like a piece of chocolate (buttery with a crisp and then melting fat). The flavor initially gives you a cocoa hit and then a winey fermented flavor that is hard to describe. The aftertaste is bitter like baking chocolate. Like a coffee bean, there's some fibrous grit with the aftertaste after the creamy fats have dissolved on your tongue. My first impressions was ""phew - that's disgusting"". The winey flavor was off-putting and the bitterness in the aftertaste was hard to take. That didn't prevent me from immediately having more, however - as the crisp rich creamy quality made me want more. After a few pinches (maybe 3/4s of a tablespoon) I was flying! I mean, these things are POTENT. They really are loaded with all those endorphin releasing stimulants - and man they wake you up and then make you feel loved. Over the next few days I kept a big baggie of these in my pack and ate them whenever I wanted a cup of coffee. The stimulant effect is totally as strong as coffee - and more. To go with the speed, there's a feeling of well being and intellectual stimulation that's seductive in the extreme. I began to almost enjoy the odd powerful flavor. My only concerns at this point are whether these are addictive! About 1/2 way through my bag I have yet to hit a stem or a stone or an inedible piece (unlike what I've heard with some other brands). The flavor and texture is pretty consistent as I work my way through too - pretty good for a totally raw organic product. I found that I could grind them up into powder in the blender and use the powder to ""cocoa"" up various foods (especially ones bearing some sweetness). For example, after my workout I'd put a tablespoon of nibs and a tablespoon of chia seeds in the blender and grind nice and fine and then toss in a fist full of frozen blueberries, a glug of Walden Farms zero calorie chocolate sauce, 8 oz water and two scoops of whey protein powder (chocolate flavor, of course) and then blend. It all whips up into a rich chocolatey blueberry shake that packs the nutritional wallop of a steak dinner with omega 3 oils, TONS of antioxidants, and a wicked emotional and blood sugar pick-me-up. You can buy the powder pre-ground, but I imagine the goodies keep better in this coarsely cracked version. All in all - I think of cacao nibs as much as a drug like coffee as I do a food. People who eat ultra-dark chocolate for the health aspects should absolutely check nibs out because my body tells me they have WAY MORE of the chemical goodies of chocolate with far less sugar and fat. They also are brimming with a rich raw cocoa flavor that's weird and wonderful and hard to describe. If you are bent in this way - this stuff is wonderful. …",24 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 4 stars for a single cat household. Not so much for multi-cat,4,"I used this litter for almost two years for my 3 yr old male cat. It worked great. Never any smells and easy to clean. Plus the larger pellets don't track. However, one problem with this and other ""set it and forget it"" litters that absorb liquids as opposed to clumps that you remove, is that there is a large grey area in terms of figuring out when to change the litter. The bag mentions that all the pellets will completely break down once they have absorbed litter, but it's hard to determine when that point is. This leaves your cat pawing through a box full of damp(with urine) sawdust if you are not studious about checking the breaking point for the litter. Still, it worked great for one cat with consistent waste(read, nice and dry poop) This ALL changed once I got a new 3 month old kitten with stool issues(more liquid than solid, I'll just say). The problem is, any ""moisture rich"" cat turds don't really absorb quickly enough into the litter and the pine pellets are too large to effectively cover any waste like that. Sooo..you're left with these pine pellet covered **** mines that my cats would step on and then...well, cat poop is not fun to have spread around the house. On top of all that, the liquid absorbent qualities of the pellets meant having to change out the entire cat box pretty much on a weekly basis and since the litter isn't flushable, this became an issue. Being able to clean out all waste(solid AND liquid) on a day to day basis is the main reason I switched over to Swheat Scoop which I really like(and have reviewed as well). It keeps the cat box truly clean and it's flushable. I will say, that even with two cats, the feline pine kept odors down to a minimum(basically, you'd have to stick your head in the box to smell odors). So, I recommend it, keeping in mind the issues I had above. I think it's more of a one cat litter. …",69 out of 70 users found this review helpful
 Superb Coffee...and a clarification on the Decaf issue....,5,"To allay any questions about whether this is decaf or not. It is indeed CAFFEINATED.

" UPDATE 07/12:  OMG, this is AWESOME!!!! Finally a really good alternative to high fat peanut butter",5,"Guys: Although this may not have the exact taste of a typical commercial brand peanut butter out of the jar, it is VERY CLOSE. THIS IS THE ONE THAT SATISFIES A CRAVING FOR CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER without all the fatty oil.. It has no chemical or weird aftertaste (it's the most peanut-nutty tasting alternative out there which I've tried), and you really can adjust the consistency based on the amount of liquid you add. Although I previously favored the ""Better-n-Peanut Butter"" brand sold here N Peanut Butter, Better N Peanut Butter, Orig Lf, 16.00 OZ (Pack of 12) and at Trader Joe's (which needs no mixing or preparation and has a real peanut butter texture), I must admit that the taste of ""better n peanut butter"" is not nearly as good as PB2 ( ""Better n Peanut Butter"" is less peanut-y and does have an odd sort of after taste) and it needs to be refrigerated after opening or it gets moldy (trust me.....yuck). Anyway, back to this product:PB2. It has a very good peanut buttery taste and if you're cooking with it or mixing it in drinks or smoothies (like a banana smoothie), the texture is a non-issue. And having it in these 1 lb packages makes it much more affordable than buying the small jars sold here or directly from PB2's website (where they add $10 shipping). And if you get at least three bags at Superstore, it qualifies for free shipping (it works out to about $8.70/lb). I also ordered the chocolate which is also good (not a strong chocolatey taste, more like a hint of cocoa), but my favorite is still the plain PB2. ***UPDATE*** Guys: I just tried another product from Byrd Mill and searched under peanut flour product (basically peanut butter with the oils removed as well) that's also very good (it's cheaper than the PB2 product here if you buy the 5 1lb. option....I ordered -1- 5 lb bag and the total price with shipping was approx. $32.65 (therefore about $6.50/lb). The package comes in about 4 days after you order, but the one negative is that it is not vacuum sealed. It's in a plastic bag with a twisty tied around it and then placed in a large paper bag with a folding top (the kind of bag that coffee beans come in, but bigger). In order to keep it fresh, I use about 1 lb. at a time and then vacuum seal the rest. They also sell larger and smaller quantities at slightly steeper discount with little change in shipping. You have an option of getting a dark roast (more peanut-y) or light roast (less peanut-y tasting) and either 28% fat left in (at 6g/serving) or 12% (at 3g fat per serving). I buy the dark roasted, 12% fat. It is definitely more peanut-y than PB2 and is smoother and creamier in texture. The only big difference from the PB2 product (which I prefer, others may not....) is that Byrd Mill does not have any salt and sugar added (it's just pure roasted de-fatted peanut flour) so you'll most definitely want to add a little salt (maybe even a little honey) to the mixture to suit your taste if your using it plain (like on a sandwich, or with crackers or right on a spoon. So if you find yourself snacking on peanut butter every day to satisfy your peanut butter cravings, go ahead and try this. …",90 out of 94 users found this review helpful

 Wonderful product,5,"I have 2 black lab mix dogs (littermates). They are now 2 years old. They didn't tell me when I got them that part of the mix was beaver. These dogs can chew anything. If it squeaks, it takes on average 10 seconds from being new to being destroyed. Don't even get me started on toys that have stuffing. Within the last two weeks, I've started allowing them to be uncrated in my house without me there. Previously, they were completely untrustworthy, but I feel really guilty crating them while I'm at work. And I thought they were acting more grown up. Not chewing my stuff, just theirs. So, I came home one day to find a highlighter destroyed (on carpeting, of course). The next day the victim was one of their dog beds that they'd always left alone. So, out of desperation I tried this product (and paid way more than the price at Superstore at a local pet store). These things are AWESOME. They keep their attention for hours and a treat lasts for about 2 days. My one dog loves hers so much that she's like obsessed with it.

 Dark and Delicious,5,"If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur. When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress. If being ""in love"" gives you a zest for life, then the ""I Love You"" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites. Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection (dark if you order this box): Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate. Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce. For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rêverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate. Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache. Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling. Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache. Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache. Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling. Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling. Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling. Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream. Also Recommended: If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations. Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior. My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September. ~The Rebecca Review …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 High Quality and Perfectly Packaged Dry Soy Beans,5,"Clearly a high-end product and exactly as advertised. Four individual fully sealed and labeled plastic bags within a outer cardboard carton with printed graphics and text. The beans are consistent in size and color, with no observable remnants or contaminants, and odorless. Labeled ""Certified Organic by QAI"", ""Product of the USA"" and ""USDA Organic"". Cooking instructions, various uses, website and other useful information is provided. Our intended use is to make Japanese Natto, which is a fermented form, and not particularly appealing unless you know and love traditional Japanese food. We are in the food distribution business in Japan and here in Hawaii. Even though Soy Beans are grown on our island, we needed a very high quality ingredient to prepare Natto correctly which wasn't obtainable here. My wife, who is from Shizuoka Prefecture, thinks these beans are premium, and we spent all afternoon yesterday preparing a full 24oz/680g package for controlled fermentation overnight. While the finishing process outcome will be to our discretion, the staple product (the beans), are unquestionably high-end. And the price was excellent.

 Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K),2,"I have been giving my cat Weruva for about a week after I received a free can from my local pet store.

I was very saddened when I learned that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K)is used in their FISH (please note this ingredient is used only in fish) I do not understand why they are using this synthetic form of Vitamin K when they could easily substitute something real like KELP. Do your own research, especially on Menadione. I would also like to greatly note that a small ""made in Thailand"" is on the can and that also freaked me out.

 A delicious treat,5,"Well, since some other user decided they'd paste their review on to each flavor allow me to give my short but sweet review: MiO is delicious. I like that I can just put in the tiniest of splashes in my drink and just have a hint of flavor... or splash a lot in and get a real flavorful experience. It's a quick and easy thing to use. It's also fun to watch it splash into the water. I've also found it's good to flavor different types of alcohol. In regards to the criticism by other reviewers for it containing propylene glycol - don't be in a panic like them. propylene glycol is harmless unless ingest massive quantities of it. Using a canard like ""it's considered harmful to pets so humans shouldn't ingest it!"" is just alarmist behavior. Chocolate is harmful to dogs. Better not eat that then! Lastly, in regards to it having so many ""food colorings"" - well, if you don't like anything that flavors your water to have anything artificial in it, squeeze a lemon into it. Put a dash of sugar. Or just drink the water plain. You know what you're getting into when you buy this stuff. Bottom line: This is my new favorite drink flavoring.

 Not their best!,2,"I am a big fan of the high quality of Celestial Seasonings products and their usually good tea blends. This particular blend does not make the cut. I want to like it but somehow the coconut does not really work in this tea. The aroma is artificial coconut, and the flavor is a strange somewhat musty coconut flavor without noticable chai spice. Drinkable but an eccentric blend--perhaps a diehard coconut lover would find this appealing. Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

 They changed the Chips now they taste horrible,1,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy. I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan. About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket. I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it. After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to. They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed. So I e-mailed Kettle with the following: ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering."" I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag. This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks. Please let me know if I can be of any more help."" Well the next bag was good. Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost. I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company. So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle. Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand. increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand. Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same... …",20 out of 27 users found this review helpful

It called for a tablespoon of lobster base (for a half recipe). I followed the recipe exactly, adding no salt and using no salt butter. The dish was so salty that we threw it out. Later, while trying to figure out what went wrong I found that this particular lobster base has 800 mg of sodium per tsp. So, I had used 2400 mg of sodium in a recipe for 4-6 enchiladas.

And I LOVE that you can put it in the dishwasher & don't have to worry about a wood handle or bristles burning and/or trapping bacteria - my old brush always kindof gave me the heebie-jeebies, basting raw meat with it and then having to hand wash and air dry - thoughts of salmonella were never too far from my mind.

 Great balsamic for the price,5,"There are different levels of balsamic vinegar. The ""tradizionale"" is consortium-approved and is generally over $100 for a four to five ounces and could be over $500 for a tiny amount. The next level is the ""condimento balsamico"" which is not consortium approved, but is about half the price or less than the previous type. The last level is ""Aceto Balsamico di Modena"", which can be really bad and there are no controls over what goes into it (artificial coloring, etc.). That being said, Fondo Carrate vinegar is producted from grapes grown without the use of pesticides or herbicides of any kind. Organically grown and produced exclusively from ancient D.O.C. Lambrusco varieties of the Mastri, Salamino and Sorbara grapes. It is 12 years old and aged in oak. Very smooth, sweet, but tangy. It really is a fine vinegar, especially for the price.

 OUT OF DATE PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!,1,"Having already ordered directly from Cafe Britt, I jumped at the chance to order Cafe Britt product from Superstore thus saving shipping costs and even getting a break on the price. My experience dealing with Cafe Britt was great. I ordered the 2lb bag of whole bean Costa Rica Dark Roast coffee and loved it. Wanting to try something different, I ordered 2 1lb bags of Tres Rios valdivia whole bean coffee THRU AMAZOM.COM. Upon opening the first bag I noticed a difference in quality that was quite apparent. I assumed it was probably because of the different type of coffee, and only after opening the second bag did I think of looking for a freshness date on the packaging. Now I ordered this coffee on July 30 and received it on August 3rd but the package has a freshness date of JUN 12(lot # 11173407).

 Great deal on quality chia seed!,5,"I'm so glad I found the folks selling this chia seed. It's such a good deal that I can't imagine buying it from anyone else and I sure hope they continue to make it available at this price. Don't believe the hype that chia seed varies much in nutritional content -- I've done the research and according to Dr. Wayne Coates from the University of Arizona all the commercially available chia seed today is from a single genetic source. Dr. Coates wrote a book reviving interest in the value of this traditional food source and in making it available to more people. I am not affiliated with the company that sells this chia seed, and the reason I did this research is that I was recently told about a ""miracle"" product made from a specific variety of chia seed, and it was outrageously expensive ($30.00/pound). It is only available through ""vendors"" and I was told it was the only chia seed that is nutritionally beneficial, not like the black chia seed used for chia pets. Well, it's not true, folks. Like anything that's grown, chia seed can be affected by growing practices, soil, etc. But it's a plant that demands very little and normally grows on very lean soils. It also is not bothered by pests, so no pesticides are needed for its cultivation. It is, however, sometimes grown in rotation with other crops like corn and maize for which pesticides are used. For this reason, organic chia seed has not yet been available. Some companies are promising that they will make organic chia seed available soon. But for now -- chia seed is chia seed, and this is perfectly good chia seed at the best price I've found. …",28 out of 29 users found this review helpful

" Not exactly like traditional potato chips, but a great substitute",5,"One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips. I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips. In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip. This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind. I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco. I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area. Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any. I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Superstore in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me. They are definitely worth the money. I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips. The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips. I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do. Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them. As for the portion size, it's pretty generous. For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors. I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next. …",73 out of 77 users found this review helpful
 MAGIC FOOD!,5,"Our five year old Thai Ridgeback was getting a little chunky after a particularly snowy winter. The owner of our dog walking service mentioned Orijen food as a way to slim her down. We had been feeding her Science Diet, 1/2 sensitive skin, 1/2 light food. We always considered her to be reasonably healthy and active. Twice before I had attempted to switch her to ""fancier"" holistic foods and both times she began losing hair. I suspected lamb as the culprit but it could have been some other ingredient. I have never reviewed anything before or felt passionate enough about a product to sing it's praises until now. The minute you open the bag you notice the food smells wonderful. It looks high quality. The dog LOVES it. It's is excruciating to wait for that first bag that is mixed 50/50 to be finished so you can completely transition. We knew right away that this was a good choice, but as time went on I was stunned at all the aspects of her health that improved. 1) Ashy-ness that she had developed on her elbows went completely away. 2) Her coat grew noticeably thicker and shinier over several months. 3) &lt;Gross-out Alert> Her stool is firm and smaller; she stopped farting, and no longer experiences **** sack leakage. 4) After a year of feeding her this food she is now visibly leaner and looks awesome for 6 years old. This is the best thing we could have done. Now the economy of it. Science Diet is $45 bucks for 30lbs. This stuff is $65. BUT, since she digests more of the product we literally feed her 2/3's the amount we used to, and she seems more satisfied, doesn't stand by her bowl and beg for more. It's basically a wash on price! In response to the reviews that claim this food is dangerous, I have a hard time believing those aren't planted by a rival company. She just got a full check up and three year rabies shot at our vet. There isn't anything wrong with her liver. The vet said they were not familiar with Orijen yet, but they agree that she is noticeably healthier and the higher protein content is perfectly safe. It's about what is not in this food that makes the difference for me. No pesticides, no cheap stabilizers, no filler grains, no ground up bones and connective tissues. I'm not a vet or nutritionist but I am a first-hand witness to the positive effects of this wonderful food. Thank you Orijen!!! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

It makes up a part of my regular lunch consisting of an apple, a banana, and a mixture of sunflower, pumpkin, and hemp seeds (1/4 of cup each). The apple a day definitely keeps a doctor away (to my delight), and the seeds provide a close to perfect combination of ""right"" protein and fatty acids. Pumpkin seeds also keep my prostate healthy, which is important in my age. Hemp seeds give the mixture the additional taste and flavor. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Motor Oil,1,"Yes I realize that many truffle oils are just an exercise in organic chemistry. However, if you want a strong truffle flavor and use a lot of this oil, then you will have a dish that smells like machine oil and still lacks a dense truffle taste. Looking at the oil from the top of a full can, you will notice small dark oil droplets suspended in an ocean of safflower oil. There's not many dark drops, which is the active ingredient. So you are really buying an expensive bottle of safflower oil. And when was the last time you remember eating truffles which looked like motor oil looking drops in your dish? There is a reason it comes in a dark metal can. Enough said, try another brand. Bottom line = yuck …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Great Product for sealing moisture in your hair!,5,"I love this product! I usually mix it with shea butter and olive oil and apply it to my hair over my conditioner to seal in the moisure. I works great because I have been retaining hair length and I rarely experience any breakage. The smell is okay and its texture is good. I also use this same mixture as a skin moisturizer and also to wash my face using a oil cleansing method. I haven't had any new breakout since I starting using it. Overall, its a good buy! …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Awesome pistachios!,5,"Soon after I ordered them, (Pistachios, Shelled, Raw* - 5 Lb Bag / Box Each by Angelina's Gourmet), I got this box in the mail with an unmarked 5lb bag of pistachios in it. I looked around to make sure no one could see me as I opened the box. Into the plain plastic bag, I dove in and started to slam back the wrinkled nutty goodness into my pie hole:They were fresh and amazing! I eat a LOT of salads, and like them for snacks and they are amazing in bread. I ate them all in a scary amount of time! It was like I had this private stash of pistachio happiness and I didn't share them with anyone! Oh the horror of having harbored such a marvelous treat all to myself! Not a single kernel shared! So many, and I could have offered them to my nut-less friends and to the under-nutted strangers who passed me by with a hunger in their eyes...But they are all gone now....snif. I think I'll order more:this time I will share...I hope. -The Pistachio Nut …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 First ingredient is trans fat ( partially hydrogenated oil ),1,"The ingredient tab on the product page doesn't show what is in this cappuccino. The very first ingredient when I got my order and reviewed it was trans fat, and not just a little. This stuff will clog your arteries. I wouldn't have purchased this had the product info been shown. I didn't know they still used this stuff. New York outlawed the stuff and the FDA explicitly makes manufactures show this ingredient. Shame on Superstore for not displaying this.

 Stopped working,1,"I used the thermometer about 7 or 8 times and it stopped working. I have seen several reviews complaining that the probe fails so I'm hoping that's the problem. Update 2/27/08: I ordered a new probe from Brookstone for $25 (incl. shipping) and it is a much sturdier design than the original. I assume they were getting a lot of complaints and returns so they redesigned it. So far the new probe is working fine. Interesting to note, I gave a negative review of this product on their web site and they never published it, although they sent me a thank you note for my review. …",43 out of 43 users found this review helpful

 SO SMOOTH AND GREAT FLAVOR,5,"I love this product, but I also love Coconut. After reading several of the online reviews about the consistency I decided to offer my routine. I have also purchased Nutiva Coconut Manna which I also like a lot. However this product does seems a bit more moist then the other one. I do still purchase both. The whole thing about these items is getting them to where the oil and the raw fibers are really well blended and if you fail to do that it could really be the difference between loving it or vowing never to eat it again. When I get a new jar I remove the plastic around the rim, then I put it in about a half inch of water in a pan (place the whole jar)...on a medium simmer. Watch it a few minutes and use an oven mitt to remove it when you really see it melt down. I then take it out of the water open it up and take a butter knife and slowly stir the oils into the fibers. This can take a few minutes but once it is done it is fabulous. You will see it transform and become really smooth,... at this point I take out what I am going to use then replace the cover tightly and put it upside down and leave in on my counter as I use it everyday. It stays mixed and smooth when I need it after I've mixed it the initial first time. It is a great source of energy, however I do understand that it is not for everyone. I will say that I use it on old fashioned oatmeal with a touch of maple syrup and a tablespoon of natural applesauce and the flavor combination and energy derived from this is incredible. Hope that this helps someone. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee,5,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday. I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now). However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee. I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"". Enter Donut Blend. I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family. When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it. Here is my take on it: It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity. Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii. It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee. If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup. Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one. Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.

 Espresso,5,"I bought a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas this year. We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good. …",29 out of 29 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Nestle Nido from Chile best powder milk in 48 years of milk drinking,5,"Nestle Nido made in Chile Ingredients, Whole milk, soy Lecithin ( emulsification properties ), Vitamin A Acetate, Vitamin D3. I did a three milk blind taste test. I mixed nonfat milk from a large country wide grocery store chain by the directions, Mixed Nestle Nido from Chile by the directions, and bought a pint of whole milk from a country wide dairy. I left the milks in the fridge over night in uncoverd identical marked glasses . This was to give them time to rest. The next day a friend blindfolded me and the test began. First a whole milk that was very good. Washed mouth and the second milk was nonfat. Easy pick taste like most nonfat powderd milk. Washed mouth. Tried third glass and was stumped. I sipped both whole milks and could tell one was fresher. I picked the fresher as the store bought and was wrong. The best was Nido from Chile. I have had two years chef prep and years cooking in the field. It is my assumption that the store bought had picked up flavor from the carton. I will keep Nestle Nido from chile as a back up and for emergency stock. I also boiled both whole milks and found the Nido performs as well as store bought. One thing to remember is to make sure the country Nido comes from does not add sugers or other flavorings to cover a bad product. Pricey but good for emergency or every day use if you through out spoiled milk. …",21 out of 27 users found this review helpful
