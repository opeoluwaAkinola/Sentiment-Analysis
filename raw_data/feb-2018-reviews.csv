" Makes crazy yummy hot cocoa, chocolate sauce,  and nice for coating frozen treats",5,"I bought this because I wanted to try using it for some new frozen and dessert treats (using raw agave and fruit). But the first thing I made after getting it a couple days ago is hot cocoa, and it was marvelous. When I opened the reclosable pouch, the scent was heavenly. It mixes beautifully (no floating gobs). Tastes richly chocolatey. I also made an organic chocolate dipping sauce with some organic virgin coconut oil. YUM! Now that I have two pouches of this lovely, fine powder, I am eager to try it in recipes (including smoothies, shakes, raw pies and frozen treats that I've gotten used to from a delivery service here in Miami). I definitely recommend this for chocolate lovers who want something less processed, organic, and very tasty for assorted uses (and I really like that it's reclosable). …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 faulty packaging and unresponsive customer service,1,"I ordered this product because it was organic and easy when out and about with my baby. However, we I received my order, one of the pouches I noticed had been punctured and was moldy. I threw it out thinking it must have been a fluke, however I ended up with another punctured pouch (that wasn't moldy, thank God) because I fed half of it to my baby before I realized it had been punctured. I was disgusted and concerned that my baby had eaten it. I went to the companies webpage, found no phone number so I emailed them at a provided email about the packaging issue, and never heard a peep out of them in response to my concern. I was kind and undemanding, just notifying them of the issue and they didn't even have the courtesy to respond. I will not purchase Plum organics again. I will stick to Happy Baby or Sprout. …",8 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Not as rich and satisfying as I thought,2,"Not really sure what I expected, but since I like Ghirardelli chocolate, and I like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops, I thought I'd like this product. Unfortunately, despite following the directions and making this in milk, it's not as rich and satifying as I hoped. I hate to say it, but I think Swiss Miss mixed Instant coffee tastes better than this. That's unfortunate, because this is a four pack of cannisters and I'm only half way through the first one! …",4 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 It's okay.,3,"This Nishiki rice is pretty much the standard American medium grain rice that's not so bad when it's first cooked. It's until you eat premium quality rice like tamanishiki and koshihikari that you'll know Nishki is a sub-par rice sold anywhere else. If you want QUALITY sushi it starts with the rice. Nishiki is not something I would personally use. You'll know the difference right away with the texture. But of course, preparation can make a huge difference. Wash your rice and let the rice sit in the bowl for 20 minutes to soak. Re-rinse and measure the water again and turn on the rice cooker (or the pot if you're cooking manually). If you don't have a rice cooker though I would get one. It's worth it and very cheap for a simple rice cooker. Feel free to read my review on tamanishiki rice. …",9 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Doesn't Work For Our Family,1,"I bought these wipes a month ago and used them every day for a week before tossing them in the trash. We live in a wooded environment and there are areas where water stands for awhile after it rains. Mosquito's are everywhere and our only break from them is during the Winter season. We've tried everything and the only two things that work for us are full coverage clothing and the dark green spray bottle of OFF Deep Woods Repellent. For these particular wipes, we used one wipe per person before going outdoors. Mosquito's began attacking us immediately. We returned indoors to use more wipes in case one wipe per person wasn't enough. The mosquitos still attacked. So we returned indoors to shower up and apply our anti-itch bug cream. I continued to go out every day for the rest of the week using these wipes and the same thing kept happening no matter how many wipes I used. My youngest is allergic to Mosquito bites so it's a big deal that we have a good repellent. She's been to the hospital for mosquito bites (how we found out she was allergic) and has to be put on antibiotics to prevent her skin from becoming necrotic. Our Pediatrician said that while there is a lot of debate on whether to put Deet containing products on young children, she suggests doing so carefully and properly which we have done. Once I tossed these wipes, I purchased OFF Deep Woods Repellent Spray. It's in a dark green bottle with an orange pump top. That product has worked excellent for us and my youngest hasn't been bitten. I think the idea of wipes is nice for a few reasons but we're going to stick with the bottle of spray. These wipes may work for others but they didn't work for us. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Declining quality  of Taste of the Wild cat food,3,"I just realized that whole chicken has been deleted from the ingredients' list and that only chicken meal is used. The protein content has also gone from 45% to 42%, which still sounds good, but I wonder how much of this protein is actually from meat. Cats can only assimilate meat protein. I have decided not to use this food for my cats anymore. …",23 out of 31 users found this review helpful
 Superior product!,5,"I have just recently begun using VCO for nearly all of my cooking. After purchasing two books on the benefits of coconut oil, I have purchased several different brands of oil. The Nutiva Organic EVCO is by far a superior oil with a delightful flavor. The price from Superstore if you are a Prime member is the best I have found for this quality of oil. I began eating the oil mixed in about 1/2 cup of cottage cheese because I read on a forum that cottage cheese has properties which help the body assimilate the oil. Since then I have expanded to many other uses. I use the oil to sautee garlic, onions, peppers, etc for all of my soups and stir frys. I spread it on toast and add it to my corn bread. In just the first week of eating coconut oil regularly I noticed that my chronic aches in my joints and muscles subsided. My skin is smoother and blemishes began to disappear. I began using it as a topical ointment on my hands, feet and face along with knees and elbows. It is a much better skin conditioner than almost anything else I have used. I found that it also works great as a conditioner for all of my wooden cooking utensils and I rub it into my cutting boards to condition them. It is far superior to mineral oil! I have introduced the oil into my husband's diet also. He has been a Type II diabetic for about 15 years and just turned 77. He is beginning to notice positive benefits also. He particularly has noticed more mental acuity. He adds the oil to his morning cereal and spreads it on his toast and really enjoys the flavor. I am so happy to have found this wonderful Nutiva oil and appreciate its many benefits. I find it kind of addictive. I now look forward to adding the oil to more and more foods and it seems to make nearly everything, including eggs, soups, stews, casseroles, muffins and breads more delicious. I highly recommend the Nutiva brand of Organic EVCO for a huge variety of uses. To those who think it has too much coconut flavor - well, I guess you can't please everyone. Try it and decide for yourself. The health benefits are worth it! This oil has given me a new energy and improved my health so positively that I would recommend it to everyone. The only downside I can mention is the plastic container. It would be better if it were packaged in glass, but hopefully all those anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties of the oil will negate the use of a plastic container ;-) …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Looks are deceiving!,2,"I purchased this as a gift for a family member. I've seen this hot chocolate in stores but I was drawn in by the package, the fact that it all came packed in one neat box. Unfortunately when I received it, this was not the case. I literally received single packets of hot chocolate minus the box, any box! I have nothing but great things to say about the quality of the product itself, this collection of hot chocolate is yummy! I'm just upset at the fact that this was supposed to be a gift and because of horrid display I had to purchase boxes to neatly pack it all in. So not only did I pay $25 with shipping, I now had to spend an additional $3.50 for a box. Not a great value if you ask me. The packets are delivered loose, so why not say that on the site?

 Cheaper Substitute FOUND!!!!,2,"Nothing wrong with the sugar besides the fact it is so expensive, and doesn't last very long but, after fun and time taking experimentation I have found a perfect and cheaper substitute, it's called ""Turbinado Sugar"" And I found some at the Whole Foods in St. Louis, but I would imagine they sell it at all Whole Foods. They sell it in bulk, and it's 1.99 per pound. So in comparison to what you buy in the store or find on Superstore (after shipping), 1 pound of Teavana Tea costs $13. For the same $13 you can buy 6.5 pounds of Turbinado Sugar. And you use it in the same ratio that you use the German Rock Sugar, so you get 6.5 times the bang for your buck …",34 out of 49 users found this review helpful
 Great dog food for dogs with digestive problems,5,"I originally bought this as a replacement for Science Diet's I/D as it was always much more expensive than anything else out there. I/D was also more expensive than Newman's at my local vet's office. I have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past. We tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. We found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her Milkbone treats. We needed something organic without a lot of beef in it. While this one does have some bi-product for protein, it doesn't seem to bother my dog at all. She also has normal stools every time which wasn't the case even with the I/D. My dog hated the I/D. She would often leave a good portion of it on the ground or in the bowl and rarely ate it in its entirety. With the Newman's own it is night and day. She scarfs it down in less than a couple minutes and usually eats a bowl in one sitting. It seems like she loves it from the way she eats it. A couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem I had with other dog foods. I gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now. My husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems with. On a side note, I wish Newman's offered a bigger size bag. I have to order these all the time due to the 12.5 pound bag. My husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size. It still works out being cheaper than the $50 bag of 17 pound I/D I was ordering so I'm still happy with it. Science diet was sending me to the poor house. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" smooth, soft and tasty",5,"I've been using Satin Ice for a year now on my cakes. I purchase it from local bakery supplies stores as well as online. It is nice and smooth, soft and pliable. It doesn't require much kneading and tastes like vanilla, a bit on the sweet side though. If old (over a year), it will taste rancid and be a bit hard but can still be rolled out. Wilton brand rolled fondant is gross tasting and not as soft and pliable. Marshmellow fondant is more pasty tasting and gummier. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Pretty nice,4,"The product consists of an approximately 10 inch (25 cm) long piece of meat with 1 or 2 smaller (approx 1 1/2-2 inches, 3-5 cm) pieces thrown in. The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package. Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt). It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather. I appreciate the fact that the pepper bits are not ""loose"" like some other jerkies, so crumbs are not much of a concern. Per the box, store in a cool, dry place.

 PET FOOD RECALL WORRIES?  NO PROBLEM WITH NEWMAN'S!,5,"Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets. Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural. In doing this research, I found out that not only does Newman's company make salad dressing, as we all know, but ALSO a VAST variety of human and pet treats as well! :) I got a great deal through Superstore on this pack of six bags, so I got two flavors and sizes for my dogs. They are ALL natural, and when you touch them yourself and feel the texture, and see the actual oats and cheese or whatnot for yourself, you will be so happy you are feeding them to your pet instead of **** food. People have no idea just how awful most name brand pet food is and that it is really like the equivalent of feeding junk food to their kids for every meal. But it's not our faults when pet food companies are abusing our trust. Get these treats.

 Beware~For dogs under 11 pounds~Caused breathing problems right away in my POM.,1,"I went by all the great reviews and saw people giving to 15 pound dogs and that is what my Pom is. When it arrived I see it says for dogs under 11 pounds only. Since I buy tennie Greenies for my dog and this is in overall length larger I gave him one. He tore into it and almost choked. Now for 20 min he is breathing heavy, if he doesn't calm soon I'll be calling the vet. I think I will be cleaning up vomit soon. I hate that I have given my dog something to hurt him when I wanted to help. Also what I didn't notice before I purchased it says wash your hands after handling. Now why do I want to put something in my dog that I have to wash my hand just because I touched it? I have contacted Superstore about these issues and they are going to update the page so that it is clear not to give to dogs over 11 pounds. …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Great for keeping your energy up,5,"I'm training for my first marathon, and order a package of these after hearing good things about them on a message board about marathons. I have to say, I've been very happy with how they work for me.

It may have been training breakthrough, it may have been strictly pyschological, but after I started snacking on the beans at the 1:45 mark, I started sustaining pace, and have actually been able to knock out my last mile on the same pace as my opening mile.

" like it so far(1 day) , added info after a week",5,"I got this yesterday and so far it looks good, I've been using silica litter but even the cheap stuff is not that cheap and is fairly dusty, so I've been looking for an alternative and this seems to be it. The silica works great for drying up odors until it gets pee saturated. I sprinkled at little of the old wet litter on the breeze litter and the cats used it right away. The pee does drain through and the pads are good, they've used it quite a few times and the pad still feels dry. I'm actually hoping they DON'T poop in it and continue to use the silica for that, then I'll have the best of both worlds, the poop will dry and the pee will be able to be gotten rid of so the expensive silica will last longer. After a week, still on the first pad and haven't noticed any odor problems. Have 3 cats and left the silica so they are using both but they are using the breeze a lot. Adding crystals or enzyme spray to the pad might stretch it's life out even longer. They've pooped in the breeze too and I haven't noticed a smell but lots of pellets glue tight so I'm losing quite a few each time. I'm used to the silica, which is much cleaner than clay or clumping and I haven't noticed any increased odor with the breeze. Changed the pad on the 8th day because, well really how far do you want to push it, and no sign of trouble. It was HEAVY with no sign of leakage or deterioration (I didn't really try to stress test it, but it came out of the tray and into the bag with no problem). …",130 out of 135 users found this review helpful
 USE THE CUPS MORE THAN ONCE!!! EXTRA VALUE!,5,"I don't know if most people know this or not, but in Japan we put loose green tea leaves in a pot and just keep pouring hot water over it until the ""taste"" is too weak. All the water must be poured out after no more than 3 minutes or else the tea will be biter. Thats why most Japanese tea sets are so small. Green tea isn't meant to be left in a teapot like english teas. So my first cup of green tea was actually a little stronger than I am used to and I actually got 3 uses out of ONE k-cup.

 Chocolate lovers: do not be deceived by this product,2,"I decided to try these as a substitute for my insatiable love of Chocolate. The reviews (and description) led me to believe that these cacao nibs are edible on their own, and a reasonably tasty alternative to what I know and love to be dark chocolate (70%+ cocoa). Alas, were that the case. Cacao nibs are best used as a cooking ingredient, not as a raw snack. They are edible (but not enjoyable) if you mix them into cereal/oatmeal/something else, but they are pretty much inedible eaten alone. I knew they would taste nothing like Chocolate, but I was hoping they would at least be enjoyable in their own way - turns out, they are not. In a nutshell, they are alternately bitter and bland, and the ""chocolate"" taste, to the extent it even exists, is indiscernible. Do not buy these if you love Chocolate and are seeking an alternative - buy them only if you have tried them and know what you are getting into. …",9 out of 13 users found this review helpful

" Good Cereal, But Nothing Like Cheerios",4,"I bought this cereal after reading all the reviews on here about how great it is as a GF version of Cheerios. Cheerios were a staple in my house before I was diagnosed with CD. While Whole O's are good, the similarities between the two stop at shape.

Whole O's are made from corn and rice, while Cheerios are more oat-based. The Whole O's are, in my opinion, exactly like Nature's Path's corn flakes, except a different shape.

" Not the greatest, but not the worst either.",3,"I drink espresso (moka) daily, and go through a 250g/8.8oz brick in about 2 weeks. In my opinion, this isn't the greatest blend from Lavazza that I've had, but it's not the worst coffee I've had either (it definitely beats the drip coffee I'd otherwise get at work). It's a 70/30 robusta/arabica blend, a dark roast with a fruity though noticeably bitter finish (but not as bad as Starbucks or Peet's coffee). The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee. I'd really give it a 2.5 or 3 but then again, all taste is subjective, That being said, this is a reasonable coffee (considering taste vs. price), but I'll probably switch back to my regular (and unfortunately more expensive) blend. …",16 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Wouldn't Send to Anyone,1,"Received this for Fathers Day and found the basket contained mostly stuffing and over-sized boxes. The very decorative box of Angilina's ""Sweet Butter Cookies"" looked like it could hold 6-8 ozs.of cookies.

The 2 oz.""California Pantry"" gourmet water crackers were edible with the Wisconsin cheese but had a lot of trans-fat and were made in Hong Kong. The 4 oz. ""Focaccia Crisps Tuscan Style Crackers"" were ho-hum, slightly not-crisp crackers, made with palm oil in Indonesia. A 2oz. slice of ""Italian Rasperry Cake"" was dry.

Check out the complete ingredients list shown in the Label Information area.) I don't find the licorice flavor to be overly strong, but you will need to like the flavor of licorice to enjoy this blend.

 STOP: PLANT STANOLS/STEROLS MAY BE DEADLY TO YOUR HEALTH,1,"I began taking Benecol four years ago and I'm now terrified. Stanols/sterols may harden arteries. They may clog heart valves. Yes, they will lower your cholesterol but cholesterol may in fact be the least of your problems.

 A tastey inexpensive caviar,5,"This item is permanently on my grocery list, because an inexpensive caviar is an invaluable component to a healthy diet. Caviar is likely the best source of healthful Omega 3 fatty acids on the planet. Animal experiments have shown that this is sufficient to offset the cholesterol. A single serving of caviar will get you _half_ of your B12 for the day, and that is not all. Think of it, dripping with DHA, and half your B12 in one heaping teaspoonful, without killing a single fish. I have written an Superstore guide about this. I have additional notes about the ingredients in the customer image section where I provide a blowup of the ingredients label. It is true that some of the inexpensive lumpfish caviars have alot of food coloring, and this one is no exception. After a careful evaluation, Blue number 1 is among the safest of the food colorings. It is eliminated relatively fast, and may actually have some healthful benefits. This caviar has far more Blue number 1 than the other colorings. It actually detracts from the taste somewhat, but for the price, I give it an A+. I have some additional information and research in my seafood wishlist, so check that out. These inexpensive caviars tend to store better than the others, so you can keep some in the pantry. Lumpfish eggs are delicious, so go ahead, eat your caviar... with a little cheese and pepper.

The down side was that it is generally more expensive than the Keurig version, but decided to make the additional investment for the above reasons. However, when we received it, it wasn't as well-made as we had hoped, mostly because it didn't stand straight, so when you spin it, the ""leaning tower"" rotates annoyingly from side to side.

 Looks like 'Reese's Puffs' Copycat...But Barely hint of peanut butter & Strange overal taste...Reese's Puff's MUCH better!,2,"-- Taste without milk: 7/10 (kinda peanut buttery crunchy rounds) -- Taste with milk: 1/10 (crunchy weird tasting things. BARELY hint of peanut butter) -- Buy Again?: No -- Details: We just got this at Vons last week because it was on sale for 2bucks, and I was having a peanut butter cereal craving and as usual, Reese's Puffs was absurdly priced (well, all cereals at vons usually are unless on sale :). So we got it thinking it'd be *somewhat* similar. Well it wasn't. My hubby complained so much that it tasted weird and he just didn't like it (at first he thought the milk was rotten, and replaced that...but it wasn't a milk problem). Then I had it, and thought, well, it was edible but just not great. I don't know how to describe the weirdness (it's not rotten or anything)...perhaps ""PLAIN Cap'n Crunch cereal, with a Teensy bit of peanut butter just tossed in without reworking the whole package to make sure it works"" ? And maybe the two just don't go together that easily? i.e. if they toss in peanut butter, they'll need to modify the base at least somewhat to make things taste ok at the end? Or maybe all the peanut butter gets washed away when milk is added? Regardless of the reason, the cereal just didn't work. Unless of course you have different expectations, and DON'T expect it to be SOMEWHAT like Reese's Puffs :) And don't really care much about peanut butter anyway, plus have different taste buds than us (or just careless ones), then the cereal may be fantabulous for you!

 misses the mark,1,"I switched our 10 week old kitten from Science Diet Kitten to Wellness Kitten because she had the runs from the 1st day we adopted her. The shelter first said she never had diarrhea, then admitted she got the runs when she was spayed 2 days before we picked her up. So we are dealing with the unknown. Two stool tests were negative so we feel this might be food-related. This kitten was also being fed wet food with the kibble (Purina Pro Plan Kitten) I did some online research and decided to stop the dry food as it contained grains which is very bad for the runs. And I also stopped the Wellness dry as it has grains. The diarrhea has lessened, but it's been 2 weeks now & I'm still stumped. I did add some dry baby rice cereal into her canned food, and also include a capsule of probiotics (spread out over 4 daily meals). She had a more formed stool today, so maybe she's turning the corner. I also question Wellness putting vegetables/fruits in this kitten food! These are NOT foods cats would eat in the wild. Is this just another company trying to make a buck off us by putting in things we know are good for human health? That would be the ultimate con job. I truly don't think cats need to eat fruits & veggies, so Wellness is fast going to the bottom of my feeding list of good foods for cats. In fact, almost all cat food companies put out junk food for our beloved forever friends! I will continue to try to find something more appropriate for this kitten, and another kitten, adopted a week later, from a different litter (and w/no digestive issues - she was/still is being fed Petsmart brand Authority wet & dry - the dry contains grains/corn, but I won't switch her as her digestion works great on it) Wellness came highly recommended to me, but my search for a grain-free/veggie/fruit-free/wheat-free kitten dry kibble continues....so Wellness Kitten kibble is off my list.

 Best baby formula for sensitive tummies,5,"GREAT GREAT GREAT PRODUCT! The milk is GOD SENT for babies with sensitive tummies, who cannot take cow milk and/or soy. My 3-months old daughter had reflux, high acid level in her tummy, colics, gas and constipation varying with diarrhea. My husband and I are both foreign residents in Switzerland and I have to say that Swiss formula market is apolling in terms of choice, and useless doctors just kept medicating her instead of changing the cow milk formula to something more appropriate, just gave her more and more different drugs which only added to the problem. At some point she was crying all day long for several days!! I stopped listening to the doctors and did some online research- tried soy milk formula and lactose free formula (both Nestle), no changes. I tried all 3-4 cow milk formulas available on the Swiss market (Adapta, Holle, Milupa, Nestle) - no changes! Finally I found a can of Meyenberg goat powder milk in the house, which I had bought previously for my organic cosmetics hobby- and gave it a try in a pure desperation. WHAT A CHANGE! She is like a different baby. ALL PROBLEMS GONE INSTANTLY- on the same day. I took the baby off all the medications these so-called specialists were overmedicating her with ( I am changing the pediatrician as well), and she feels perfect and is happier than I've ever seen her. I am stashing up with this milk now for a long time, as no Meyenberg milk is sold locally. Would highly recommend this product to all parents looking for a healthy solution for their babies- goat milk protein is much easier to digest by small tummies. Furthermore, historically, long before any commercial baby formulas were invented, goat milk (and NOT cow milk!!! soy was not even on the menu) was used for centuries to feed babies by mothers who could not breastfeed. Today, when everything is Marketing-driven and cow milk manufacturers are dominating the market, this fact is totally forgotten, and all of a sudden other products are advertised to be appropriate (on top of that commercial brands stuff their formulas with all sorts of ingredients and chemicals their imagination can come up with- no matter if good for babies or not). The Meyenberg goat milk has few, simple ingredients which do not overwhelm small tummies, it is fantastically nutricious, natural and tasty. My daughter cannot get enough of it- I never saw her having such a healthy appetite towards any other milk she was given. The only request to the seller (the Vitamine Shoppe - actually one of the most professional sellers on Superstore)- please please please speed up your order processing! Although it arrived earlier than estimated (7 days instead of estimated 9 days after the order was placed), but the order processing itself took 5 days before it was actually shipped by expedited shipping. This is far too long, if the baby cannot eat anything else. If you could process orders faster- it would help a lot! Thank you very much for shipping this product to Switzerland anyway (I think it is almost the only reliable seller who does)- it's a life savior. …",36 out of 36 users found this review helpful
" The Perfect K-cup, 40 Years in the Making",5,"First of all, yes, it is expensive. Though currently at $59.99 for a 54 ct, the price is not part of my review. I'm sure it'll come down eventually. I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now. As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend. Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill. I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1. The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor. 2. I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place. There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago. It is THE perfect medium blend. There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers. It's bright, but not too bright. Does the K-cup version do it justice? Yes. Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup. I just got home with these an hour ago, and 3 cups later, I can honestly say my prayers have been answered. You know what? Even at $59.99, this review would be 5 stars. It's that good. …",12 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 not the best for my cat,1,"I got this for my cat, thinking it was 'human grade', grain free, hence good for my cat. I realized the marketing is aimed at human sensibilities because it certainly looks and smells good enough for 'people' food. It may be great for some cats, but mine gained 2 lb since she's been eating this and I was feeding her much less than suggested. She also developed urinary problems. My vet who is one of the few vets who have studied nutrition, tried calling Weruva to find out more specifics about their food including calories, because many of her feline patients were eating Weruva and gaining considerable weight. The staff at Weruva would not talk to her or answer her questions and I couldn't guess why that would be unless their research has no real scientific backing to indicate this is a nutritious food. I tried calling them about week after that to see if they would tell me anything -- I got the same dismissive response. Pet food is not regulated and these smaller manufacturers can get one vet to review their ingredients and pay them off to say - 'hey this is a great, human-grade, grain free food'. While I've read the positive reviews about this food and some obviously find their cats love it, if your cat is gaining weight or developing urinary problems while on Weruva, think twice about buying it. …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" IF you like this, just try tasty east Soy Jerky",1,"First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand.

Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available. Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them. This tasty eats soy jerky is the best tasting and what more, no onion or garlic powder in any of their product line. They are rated 5 of 5.

 A good multi-purpose product,5,One issue of drinking home brewed spiced tea is many of the products out there do not work well with simmering finer spices. These bags once tied tight do the job better than anything else I've tried. I've also used the bags to stuff herbs and spices in poultry for the rotisserie and I have use them in pots of soup/sauces (where I want the flavor but not the herb texture). They worked wonderfully and held up well for all of these purposes. I am sure they work equally well for scent sachets or a number of other purposes.

 Excellent Quality,5,"I don't normally use honey but I drink a fair amount of tea and wanted something healthier than white sugar or products like Splenda, etc. Just got two one pound jars of Really Raw Honey and I must say it's much nicer than what I'm used to at the local grocery store. It's packed in glass jars which is the proper way to pack honey (it can absorb things from plastics). Plus its totally unfiltered yet seems more sophisticated in both taste and texture than the super market stuff. It's a solid, so it's less messy than the liquid variety. I just made a cup of tea and dipped a spoon into the honey and it scoops easily up and melted into my tea right away, If you think honey is too cumbersome to use, reconsider. I can't honestly say this brand is better than others in its class but it is definitely nicer than the typical filtered, liquid, plastic squeeze container variety found in most super market brands. Addendum: April 2009 - my latest jars have been 2Lbs 10oz sizes. These have been packed in plastic, not glass jars unlike my 1lb jars were.

 Don't  Buy it online!,4,"I love these when I tried them for the first time this year. I couldn't find them after Halloween so I went online. The Online Candy Shop sold a box of 100 for $14.97 plus $11.25 for shipping which I thought was outrageous. I bought it anyway 'cause I liked them. I went to Sam's Club a week later and saw them in the candy section, same count, for less than $10.00 dollars! If you decide to buy these, don't do it online, it's a rip-off at least in the shipping cost. I feel duped! Anyway, live and learn...go to Sam's Club instead! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Menopause Relief,5,I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep. I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately. I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes. I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink. I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much. …,16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Flaky pie crust,5,"Learning to bake without gluten is a new process for me. I thought that working with the dough seemed more like making a cookie dough than rolling out a pie crust. Without gluten it lacks the elasticity that I am used to. Once I got the knack of working with the dough and doing some patching I was very pleased with the results. The flavor and appearance of the pie were not distinguishable from a crust made with wheat flour. In fact, the crust was flaky and even better than many pie crusts that I have eaten. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Techno-BEST,5,"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek. There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine. The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup. This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion. It's easy to hold and get out of the machine. The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier. This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut. Ingenious.

 Cheap ingredients in an expensive bottle,1,"This oil was something else a decade or so ago. It was also pricier. When I recently bought it at a local Indian grocer, I was surprised the price had dropped significantly. Hair oils in India are traditionally coconut oil mixed with other essential herbs, extracts etc - which is what I assumed Dabur's would be too. What a disappointment to find this only but an unhelpful formula of 1. Canola oil 2. Paraffinum Liquidum (a fancy name for Mineral oil) 3. Palm Glycerides (Solids as byproducts from hydrogenating Palm oil)...search the internet for contra-indications for these and it should steer you far away...Goes to show, bigger brands are not necessarily better (DABUR is huge in India)Unfortunately my purchase was not from Superstore and I ended up tossing it - so no refund. I would highly recommend pure coconut oil: you can use essential oils to add to its perfume, but sometimes I even use Azulene oil on my scalp. Works like a charm for oily, greasy scalp days... …",31 out of 33 users found this review helpful

Since I like to cook a lot at once and use the rest for left-overs, the other gluten free (brown rice and potato only brands) did not do well when re-heated, and also had a ""different"" consistency --according to my daughter. This brand is incredible, perfect texture, cooks easily, and my husband (who is a Sicilian) will even eat it , and once mistook it for his favorite brand!

 Excellent product. Great energy food and surprising appetite suppressant.,5,"I tried this product after reading research regarding the excellent nutritional value of the product - high level of omega 3, high fibre content, high calcium and iron levels in addition to its impact on glycemic levels and cholesterol. The research was conducted by St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and was led by a professor of Medicine from the University of Toronto. After trying it out for a month, I have noticed an improvement in my energy level and surprisingly, some inadvertent weight loss. It turns out that since this product absorbs water, it acts as an appetite suppressant as well. I can't say enough about this and highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to boost energy and add nutrients to their diet. I usually add this to cereal, but have also sprinkled this onto blueberry muffin dough before baking. Surprisingly light nutty taste that does not interfere with anything I add it to. I recommend the whole seeds rather than the grain which tends to make liquids thicken up almost immediately. …",59 out of 60 users found this review helpful

I consider myself a hardcore chocoholic and can handle intensity on the choco scale. But this is more or less like baking chocolate. There is almost no sugar in it, and while that may be good for flavor, it's almost inedible on its own. I'm confused by those who rated it so highly but I guess taste is totally subjective. I'm usually the one of my friends who likes the darkest, least sweet chocolate, but this is just not working for me at all. …",4 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Made in China and bad for the planet,1,"I loved the taste of this product but just noticed they are made in China. I contacted the company to get more information. They said they test for quality but in fact the list they gave me was for bacterial contaminants only. They do not test for lead or other heavy metals, just salmonella, aflatoxin and microbiological testing. And they do not own the factory, they just contract out the production and inspect the factory. As for the ingredients, some of them are from China, such as the malt syrup. And the US ingredients are shipped all the way to China, the product is made, then it is shipped all the way back. This was to cut costs according to a business journal report on the company. I hate to see what the carbon production is for each bar based on that practice. And for the price they sell the product for, which is quite expensive, this way of saving a buck speaks poorly to the company's ethics. I for one will no longer buy this product. …",169 out of 190 users found this review helpful
 They changed the Chips now they taste horrible,1,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy. I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan. About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket. I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it. After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to. They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed. So I e-mailed Kettle with the following: ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering."" I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag. This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks. Please let me know if I can be of any more help."" Well the next bag was good. Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost. I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company. So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle. Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand. increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand. Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same... …",20 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 So what is coconut manna?,3,"So, the minute I found out that there was something called coconut manna, I couldn't sleep thinking about it! There is so LITTLE information about it online, as to what ""manna"" truly was that I just had to try it for myself. Well, first what is it? It's basically mashed up/ground coconut ""meat"". It has the consistancy of peanut butter that has been slightly melted. It is also a little gritty too. I was under the impression that it was sweet but it's not. It is as sweet as unsweetened coconut mash would be. I was misled by other reviewers that said that it was soooo delicious and they eat it straight from the jar. I wouldn't do that. It's just plain boring. BUT...I think it's the kind of product that would work well in a recipe that called for coconut flavor or texture like cookies, cakes, smoothies, and frostings. But just to repeat, IT IS NOT SWEET LIKE PEANUT BUTTER! I rate it a 5 out of 10. If you have a sweet tooth like me, this is not the product for you. If you just need an authentic coconut spread, you've got it. PLEASE NOTE: It may be too hard to eat at first. In that case, warm the jar in boiled water for 15 minutes, stir with a butter knife, and let the ""ok"" times roll! …",15 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Best Value EVO Coconut Oil Available,5,"After searching long and hard for the best value extra virgin organic coconut oil on Superstore, I found this product. Unfortunately since I made the purchase, the price has gone up from about $18 to about $20, but it is still the cheapest EVO coconut oil on Superstore. This is the only EVO coconut oil I have bought, but in my opinion from research I have done, all such products are the same or virtually the same in terms of quality, based on how they are produced. Again, I do not know how other EVO coconut oil products taste, but this product tastes (and smells) great to me, just like fresh coconut, so why would I pay a lot more for another product? As far as I can tell it is identical in every way to the more expensive EVO coconut oil products on Superstore, so I am guessing that few people have bought it and thus no one until now has reviewed it because they assume the lower price means it is lower quality, and I can attest that this is not true. You do have to buy 3 of the 54 oz containers to qualify for the free shipping deal, but if you use this product as much as I do every day, that shouldn't be a disadvantage at all. Lastly, the product actually arrived a day before the expected arrival date, which has only happened for me once before in all my time shopping online, so Vitacost is definitely a reputable seller. Who says you can't sell a high quality product for an affordable price? This is definitely an exception to that rule. …",37 out of 37 users found this review helpful
" As a Red Bull Enthusiast, I Highly Recommend This!",5,"This is an excellent, cost-effective alternative to Red Bull. The flavor is spot on--even though a purist may be able to notice the difference, I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal! For the price, two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this. Also, with this syrup, you have the option to how strong or weak you'd like to make each serving. I find that I can add less than the recommended amount and make this mix go even further. I think you would be hard-pressed to find a cheaper alternative that tastes so close to the original. …",32 out of 34 users found this review helpful
 Miracle Frooties are sooooo cool,5,"Like most people, I was skeptical about trying Frooties. I read a lot of articles about the product and watched many You Tube videos. Curiosity finally got the best of me and I placed my order. My order arrived today. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they included a free Frootie in with my invoice as a thank you. I started by lining up a host of items: Lime wedges, Lemon Wedges, Star Fruit slices, Pure Vitamin C powder (incredibly sour), Plain Greek Yogurt, Sour Cream, Brussels Sprouts, Red Wine Vinegar, Tabasco Sauce & Vodka. I popped my Frootie in my mouth and swished it around for about 3 minutes. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to swallow my saliva so I just held it in my mouth the whole time then spit when I was done. First, the lemon wedge. I took a bite and my eyes lit up. It tasted like a lemon that someone had rolled in powdered sugar. It was sublime. Next I tried the Lime wedge. Again, you taste the lime but it tastes like a lime candy. I started laughing. The Star Fruit tasted almost like a soft apple. It was sweet and had a mild crunch. I ended up eating about 4 slices of that. I mixed the vitamin c powder into a glass of water. When I took a mouthful, I naturally expected a very sour taste. Instead, it tasted like a light lemonade. I was so curious that I actually stuck my finger directly into the Vitamin C powder and tasted it. It tasted like a Pixi Stick. The Greek yogurt tasted tart still, but had a very pleasant sweet taste. What surprised me the most was the sour cream. It tasted like a really creamy frosting...hard to explain but I had 3 teaspoons of it! The Brussels sprouts tasted like chestnuts. I really enjoyed their flavor. The Tabasco sauce almost tasted like a V8 juice EXCEPT the tip of your tongue can still sense the heat. So it was sweet, but the tip of my tongue told me otherwise. I now realize why people shake it onto their tongue in the videos. The red wine vinegar still smelled very much like vinegar as I brought it to my mouth. I had a hard time with that one. But when it hit my tongue, it tasted like a port. It is nothing I would drink, but I had to take a sip out of curiosity. At this point I was starting to worry that my stomach was going to pay me back, but it felt completely fine. I journeyed on and tried a small sip of vodka, which simply tasted like water. There wasn't much of a taste. I imagine if you squeezed lemon juice into it, you would probably have a fantastic ""lemon-drop"". After my tasting spree I cleaned everything up, got a glass of water and went into the other room. About 1 hour later I found myself going back to see what a Brussels sprout tastes like without the frootie. I bit into one and it still tasted like a roasted chestnut. To check myself I bit a small wedge of lime and it too still tasted like lime candy. The effect was still working after more than one hour. I got online to order another package because I have organized a ""Flavor Tripping Party"" which is what these parties are called when you pop a frootie and serve all these bizarre foods. If you've got an adventurous spirit, give them a try. I hope my ramblings have helped answer someone's questions and motivated someone else to give them a try. …",88 out of 90 users found this review helpful
" If you're diabetic or on a low-sugar diet (like South Beach), don't buy this!!",1,"For whatever reason, the sugar in this product isn't mentioned in the advertising. If you check the ingredients, the 1st one listed is evaporated cane juice, which is sugar, although a natural form of it, and sugar (the regular kind) is also listed a few ingredients later. I was excited about buying this product because I believed it was a Truvia-only sweetened product (which i prefer to artificial sweeteners). However, I definitely won't be purchasing it because it contains sugar and Truvia. A 70 gram container (a whole box) contains 210 calories - all from sugar. To some people this may not seem like much, but to others who consume lots of drinks sweetened with Truvia or artificial sweeteners, it can be a problem not knowing about it.

 Tabasco is the best... Forget others.,5,"I am a fan of spices... No one has what Tabasco has. The healthiest out there. Only 30 mg of salt per spoon. Others not only cannot compete with Tabasco's taste but they have 200 plus mg of salt in each spoon. That is ridiculous amount of salt. Do not need to refrigerate the Tabasco bottle for one year at all so you can leave it outside at room temperature. I have been using Tabasco for 40 years all over the world. This gallon costs me only .41 cents an ounce. You cannot get that in Wal-Mart or anywhere else except right through Superstore. Tabasco sent me a free Tabasco salsa as well. Thanks to both great companies with excellent service, Tabasco and Superstore. Simply Bravo... I add brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red Gallon to all my dishes since it is the spiciest of all. It is not thick like the Chipotle but it is very unique test when I am making dishes that have many different ingredients since it mixes well. I add brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce - Gallon to the tortilla pizza that I make with cheese and herring since this is heavier and tastier but not as spicy as the original red or green. I add the green brand Green Jalapeno Pepper Sauce - Gallon with anything that I make with eggs including the egg sandwich in between tortillas since this is the best with eggs. I love beans and lintels so after cooking those I add serrano chilli pepper deeped in Italian vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, eggplant and the Habanero brand Habanero Sauce - Gallon and I can tell you that becomes real hot. I place the mix in between hot tortilla with avocados for consumption. Now that does not mean that I am limited with these food selections since many times I may mix all those Tabascos together. Regardless, I have never been disappointed since it is truly delicious, spicy, hot without all the garbage and additives that it is out there in other brands without the taste. I have a very healthy diet and I consume healthy food without additives. Thanks and Double bravo to Tabasco. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Great snack....even during battle!!,5,"I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Superstore).
