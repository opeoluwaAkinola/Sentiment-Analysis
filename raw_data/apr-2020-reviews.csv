 Dog Danger,1,"I purchased two of these for our labs at Christmas. I filled them with their usual training treats, and the dogs loved them...they played with them for about 30 minutes trying to get to the treats. Then...the two dogs figured if they bit off the ball on the end of the rope, they could get the treats to fall out sooner. Yup...within 30 minutes the plastic ropes were destroyed. It could really be a danger to dogs if swallowed. (This is why I watch the dogs when they get new toys...and thank goodness I did.) Anyhow, totally disappointed with the product, it's safety and the price. THESE TOYS ARE NOT LAB-TOUGH! …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 This works very well when you can't tolerate coconut milk,5,"I have a problem with digesting food, especially coconut milk. I cannot tolerate it (tried fresh and caned) and I don't know why, but this one didn't give me problems. Same goes for their unsweetened, shredded coconut flakes. First, I used a little in a dish then ate it straight out of the fridge when it solidified in the cold. If you have digestive issues, give this product a try. The consistency is creamy with bits of coconut in it and has a mild coconut flavor, not very strong but when I used it in a Thai dish, the coconut flavor came out very nicely. …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful
" Not bad, not bad at all",4,"Being a long time fan of the piggy skins, and having tried a ""microwave bag"" version of u-cook-em rinds, I wanted to try something that wasn't drowning in packaging. And I'm happy with these tasty nuggets. I find in my fairly powerful microwave that i have to run a small plate of the condensed pieces (as they're shipped) for at least 1:45 (package says try 90 seconds to start) and I don't think it's my imagination that after these are taken out of the nuke chamber, they start to contract a bit. But, when you consider that you can get a fresh, hot plate of puffy rinds in very short order, these are well worth the price. Of course you can get a trash-bag full of rinds at warehouse stores and other venues for a couple few bucks but for fresh eating at home, the only thing I'd compare these to is fryin' up a batch and these are hugely more convenient. On a 10 point scale, I'd give these a 7 but on the Zon's 5 star system, I have to go with 4. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Seriously Delicious!,5,"I know that coffee reviews are subjective -- we all have different tastes and preferences, right? So I'm writing my review based on my own preferences for a light roast coffee with a ""soft"" flavor (rather than overly bitter or bold). This is currently my 100% absolutely favorite k-cup flavor. While it's brewing I get the distinct aroma of cinnamon rolls. I brew in a Keurig B40 and choose the 9.25oz serving size and think the brew strength is exactly right. My usual method of serving is to heat about 6 ounces of skim milk in the microwave for 1 minute, add about 1 tablespoon SF Torani Vanilla Syrup and froth using my Aerolatte thingie. Then I add the coffee to the milk and stir gentle. It's as good as anything I can get at Starbucks! …",26 out of 28 users found this review helpful

 Nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what's on the label.,1,"According to an article on CNN on 8/5/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the lable. ""Researchers at ConsumerLab tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients. The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., also matched the label.

 smells like pipe tobacco,1,"I wanted so much to like this product! I had heard wonderful things about the tea (as you can see by the glowing reviews) but I could not tolerate the smell. I opened the bag and thought it smelled exactly like pipe tobacco. In spite of this, I forced myself to brew some. It was horrible!

 Delicious! The Original Super-Food!!!,5,"If you have never tried Millet you are in for a very pleasant surprise. Millet has been around for a very long time but fell out of favor in American diets long ago. It's a shame because millet is one of the most complete nutritional foods available. It is low fat, has low/no gluten, very low allergic - ie easy to digest making it the perfect choice for many that have allergies to other grain forms and is packed full of vitamins, minerals and essential amino acids like methione that are rarely found in other grains but critical to normal functioning. Millet can be cooked like a hot cereal with a tad of honey added in the morning, added to rice or other grains to make a pilaf type dish, ground for breads or added whole to cold cereal, muesli and other forms. This is a nice starter set for those trying it for the first time, comes in re-sealable bags and is delicious. Millet remains a major source of nutrition in many nations and for those that think they have a memory of millet but not sure where/how...it is those main little round seeds found in bird food mix. This is a clean, organic form rather than agricultural quality. Stores easily, lasts a long time, Packs a punch when it comes to nutrition. Makes a great food for emergency preparenedness since is cost effective, super nutrious and easy to cook with in a variety of forms. Toss a handful into rice to boost nutrition without the high cost, grind or add whole to bread for a delicious flavor and texture plus superior nutritional benefits. Try it - a versatile superfood you will really grow to love! …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Affordable Dog Puzzle!!!,4,"I bought this puzzle to help entertain my smart and curious and food driven dogs. My ""boys"" love it! We play it every single day. Often to work on obedience (sit, get it, down, get it!) and just for fun administration of treats and even dinner. My golden retriever loves it, but is a chewer, so he must be supervised with it. He pulled the cups out and thought that in itself was the reward... LOL but once I simply pointed to the treat hidden in the pawprint dish, he figured it out and was a happy camper. I also bought the spinner, which is actually my favorite of the two styles. I can get my golden's entire kibble allotment for one meal (we feed twice a day) inside it, so it slows down his feeding (so he doesn't gulp it down and get bloat). I know that my dogs love it by the perked ears and bouncing when they see me pick one of the toys up. They also sit and wait to be ""released"" to start their game. Great fun! The plastic is nice too since you can disinfect it easily or wash it in the sink without worrying about warping, splitting, or cracking wood like on the expensive models of similar toys. Plus, the price has been great and I found it at my local canine speciality store too! …",39 out of 39 users found this review helpful
 Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on,5,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups. I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive. I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products. If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :) EcoBrew VS Solofill First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew. Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker. These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable! I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product. The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly. …",559 out of 562 users found this review helpful

 Quality and convenience,5,"I do quite a bit of baking, and when a recipe calls for milk, I usually add dry milk powder to the dry ingredients and then add water for the liquid. Over the years, I've tried many different dry/instant milks. This is the best! The convenient pouch is resealable, and easy to open wide enough to insert a measuring cup. To me, that is preferable for measuring over a small pour spout. The milk powder itself is silky in texture, and dissolves quickly. It doesn't seeem to lump and clump like many do. The flavor is excellent, like all Organic Valley products. While I don't personally reconstitute dry milk for drinking by the glass, for those who do, this could be a good choice due to the ease in dissolving and the fine flavor. Because the seal is quite secure, it is also more shelf stable than most. This has earned an ongoing place in my pantry. …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Really yummy tasting-I was pleasantly surprised!!!,5,"I'm not big on chips period, however I do like salt and vinegar chips when they are not greasy and thick. My husband brought home a bag of salt and vinegar Pop Chips and I tried them and loved them! Especially since they are NOT fried and don't have that un-tasty ""healthy"" baked lack of flavor. I wanted to try the other flavors so I bought the mixed flavors on Superstore. I have to say, my favorite is the salt and vinegar-but I'm vinegar mad. The black pepper and sour cream and onion come in second, then the cheese and plain. My least fav is the bbq as the flavor is just too strong for me. I like that its a kind of ""junk food"" product I can have in the house and not feel guilty about because it only tastes like its bad for you! …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Be careful with wheat gluten,1,"I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used. The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs. When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract. This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines. This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating. Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off. The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal. So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat. It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains. Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies. …",24 out of 47 users found this review helpful

 the Peanut bar,3,"I was looking forward to receiving this order. Almonds, macadamias, and walnuts! Sounded delicious. Then I tried one, and was puzzled. Yes, I could taste some almond, but WOW, the main flavor was PEANUTS. The ingredients list peanuts as the largest amount of nuts. This should be called the Peanut, Almond Bar. If one likes to have the main flavor of a nut bar as peanuts, you will enjoy this. The quality of KIND products I appreciate, as well as the low GI, the natural properties, and having a healthier choice. But honesty in advertising and product would be appreciated. I was disappointed with the deception, and the unexpectedly strong flavor of peanuts, as I purchased it for the nuts I like best, which were supposed to be the main source of nut protein.

It's very healthy, keeps you on your stumps and even is good for the tongue or back bone. But don't make it too hot or you'll burn your fingers if you don't have a fork or straw. It builds muscle tone, eye cordination, keeps calcium levels in check and improves overall digestive systems and opens clogged gas tracts.

" Fabulous food! HIGH FAT CONTENT, tho - be warned...",4,"Taste of the Wild has had so many benefits for my dogs, that I have found it very difficult to know that I must switch foods. With an 18% fat content, you'll find that it is one of the highest fat-content foods on the market. Both of my dogs have put on WAY too much weight... and one of my dogs (both border collies) is an EXTREMELY ACTIVE & fit ""frisbee dog"". My other BC, however, has battled lyme disease - and so has achy joints and fatigue. It makes exercise difficult, and the weight has piled on. My dogs LOVE the taste of Taste of the Wild (Buffalo)- so much so that they have been PICKING it out of the weight control food that I mix with Taste of the wild (I'm in the process of switching to a lower fat content food)! Having fed Taste of the Wild for the past 2 1/2 years, I can say that their coats are BEAUTIFUL.. shiny and healthy...their stools are firm and ""consistent"" (easy to pick up)..they love the taste.. and the price for such a high quality food is very affordable (I buy it from Tractor Supply). 1 of my dogs is wheat-intolerant, so this has been very easy on his system! Unfortunately, this food is a little bit TOO good, and now I must put both dogs on a diet! I'm hoping Taste of the Wild will create a version of this product that is more around 10-12% fat content so that we can once again feed our dogs this WONDERFUL food. *Note, I do not over-feed. My dog who battles the effects of lyme disease (which was treated somewhat successfully), received less than the recommended amount for a dog that is 65 lbs. My other dog, 40 lbs, ate the recommended amount. **UPDATE** : AFTER writing my initial review, I opted to keep one of my dogs on this food for awhile as I researched what food would be best for him. Then, as his activity level went up - he went from having gained a few lbs, to losing weight very rapidly, and was ""scary"" thin. Our vet evaluated the food, and as it turns out, grainless food is not for him and his activity level (not enough fuel to burn). Our dogs LOVED this food, and I believe it is a very high quality, affordable, healthy food for dogs. It just didn't work out for mine, unfortunately. …",24 out of 29 users found this review helpful
" I'll drink, but I won't switch!",4,"Note: The zeros were cast by a troll and her gang, not real and decent people, and are against me personally and not the book or the review! Switch is a new, delightfully tasting carbonated drink. I love the equal blend of black cherry flavor--light and refreshing, with the light kick of the fizz of carbonation and the bubble feel in my mouth! In fact, that's how Switch bills itself: A perfect balance between juice and carbonation. That's my rave over this new drink. Now here's my reluctance to embrace the drink with five stars. I poured the 8.3 fluid ounces into a small glass (I have a huge collection of mismatched, but adorable clear glasses of all sizes, including this little bowl wine glass I removed from a college cafeteria in France many years ago). The glass held the contents of this tall, thin can of cheery cherry drink perfectly. But wait, by the time I quaffed the contents, I held the glass askance and asked: Is that all? I want more! In comparison my favorite beverage, Zero Sprite, holds 12 fluid ounces, a perfect amount to quench my thirst after a few hours working in the yard. I add ice to Sprite and don't care if it is watered down, but this Black Cherry Switch? No, one does not want to water down this exotic flavor. It must be drunk straight. As for its can slogan: ""100% of what you want and 0% of what you don't,"" I'm not sure about that. Let's examine it. ""What you want"" is ""100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, All natural, Carbonated, Great taste and refreshment."" I agree with all of those. So far, so good. Let's look at ""what you don't"" want: ""No sugar added, No corn syrup, No preservatives, No artificial colors, and Gluten free."" True on all those. Next the label. This is where it gets confusing. Total fat 0g, Sodium 15mg, Total Carbs 35g, Sugar 33g, Protein 0g, and 130 calories. The 33 grams of sugar can be confusing. If none was added, then the 33g must come with the natural juice. And Switch does bill itself on 100% juice. In comparison my Sprite can contains 38g of sugar and 140 calories. I thought Zero Sprite contained zero sugar. My bad. I didn't read the label. It is free of caffeine, fat, cholesterol, fiber, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, but no mention of sugar, which I assume comes from the corn syrup. I'm no nutritionist, but it seems that drinking Switch is much better than drinking a Zero Sprite, except that the can is larger so you get more. I would change those four stars to five now, except 8.3 Fl OZ still is not quite enough for one drink. Will I switch? No, but I will add Black Cherry Switch to my fridge for an occasional delightfully refreshing drink when I don't need more. Or else, I will have to trudge up to the headmaster, hold out my cup, and plead: ""May I have more, sir?"" Wouldn't that be embarrassing at my age? …",3 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 The Original.,5,"Earl Grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can't go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend. (From the Twinings website: ""When the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family's long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey's tea by name."") Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend's particular flavor. (But that's just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Misleading,1,"I must admit, these taste very good and info on the box says ""Indulgence you can feel good about"". Don't believe that for one minute. The second ingredient in this product is sugar. It's a tiny, thin 2.5 inch square (approx 17g or slightly over half an ounce). Look how this product compares to a fun size snickers bar (15g) Granola Thin / Fun Size Snickers Calories: 80 / 72 Cal from fat: 35 / 33 Total Fat 4g / 3.7g Saturated fat 1.5g / 1.3g Cholesterol 0 / 2mg Sodium 75mg / 39.9mg Total Carb 11gm / 8.9gm Sugars 6gm / 7.4gm Protein 1gm 1.2gm These actually compare somewhat UN-favorably with the candy bar, at least in terms of fat, sodium and carbs. Granted, the difference is not huge. What bugs me is it's essentially candy masquerading as ""healthy"". Also, with both the fiber is fairly negligible. I'm not saying they come right out and say it's ""healthy"" but they certainly do imply it. Lets talk about cost. There are 10 packages in a box. Each package is .6oz. I paid about 3.40 for my box. I paid that for about 6-7 ounces of product. So if I were buying them by the pound, I guess that would be over 8.00 for 1 pound. For that price, I can buy myself a nice steak. As I said before, these do taste good but I find the cost is prohibitive and they aren't really any better for you than candy and are very small. I doubt I'll be buying them again and for sure they are not an ""indulgence"" I would feel good about giving to kids. …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 1 gram of trans-fat per 16 grams of cookie!,1,"As of Nov 2007, the Keebler website says that each 16 gram serving contains 1 gram of trans fat! Don't take my word for it that this is terrible, because here are some quotations from the survey article Mozaffarian et al ""Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,"" The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354, pages 1601-1613 (2006). Here are a few quotations from this article: ""given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD [""coronary heart disease""] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. ""heart attacks""] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted."" Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet: ""The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed."" They conclude ""On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm."" Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook ""nutritional epidemiology"", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book ""Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."" …",3 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 Great Value - Too Loosely Packed,4,"I bought these to use with a Handpresso portable espresso maker. The first few shots that I made came out a bit too quickly (as others have mentioned) and had a slightly wattery taste with very little crema. THIS ISSUE CAN BE RESOLVED! After the first few shots, I decided to add some additional tamping pressure to the pod by pressing down on it with a solid object (I found that a mason jar or coffee mug both worked great) with the hopes that this would increase brewing time and provide a more satisfying shot. It worked, and now my shots come out perfect, with good flavor and tons of crema. I have to give these pods four stars for the poor tamping, but fortunately this is something that can be resolved quite easily. …",24 out of 27 users found this review helpful

 Great Source of Energy but Expensive to drink everyday : (,4,"I've always been a huge fan of 5-hour energy drinks, but it's just too expensive for me to take on a regular basis, I know I tried! I've always preferred not to drink coffee, the only way I can stand it is if I overload it with sugar so that's kind of a bust. My co-worker who is a crazy health nut introduced me to this energy stack, Energy Booster Stack (90 Day Servings!) Better Than Jack3d, Red Bull, Monster, Hemorage, Caffeine, Rockstar Drink which I've been taking in the morning and really liking it. If you ever taken raspberry ketones, dmaa, or yohimbine extract then you know what I mean when I talk about an energy high that feels different from caffeine. I also like the cost, very affordable. I'll always be a 5-hour energy drinker here and there but if you need a consistent source of energy and are concerned with price, this is the most effective and cost effective energy booster I've found.

 Not So Good,2,"This jerky sounded pretty promising. It has a great price, and they use quality beef and no chemicals. When I got it, however, I was very underwhelmed by the flavor. It was too sweet, and not spicy enough. Also, when I got done chewing on a bunch of it, I would have a wad of unchewable fatty junk in my mouth which I had to spit out. Pros: -They use quality beef with no growth hormones or antibiotics -None of the chemicals that are in a lot of jerky -Texture was good, but not great -Good price Cons: -Not very spicy -Sugar is the second ingredient, making it way too sweet and not as healthy as it could be. -Beef cuts a little too fatty.

It's strange -- the salmon flavor does harden faster than the peanut butter flavor. But, all in all, they're a good treat to feed your dog because they're so small.

 HIGH ARSENIC LEVELS,1,"6/10/12 For those interested in the Holle brand of formula, please visit: violey At the top of the page please select English and then perform a search for Holle. Please also see the pictures here for the nutritional information for the stage 1 and stage 2 Holle formulas. Please continue to feel free asking questions/concerns, etc in the comments. There is a bunch of info in there, along with other user testimonials, so be sure to check them out, too. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ****As of 2/16/12 since the news of the elevated arsenic levels, we are searching for an alternative. The Nature's One brand of Baby's Only, both Dairy and Soy based formulas, have been mentioned as being the highest of the brands tested. This information was published on several different media sites that I was able to find. Although the scientific results and brands were not released, I've found from several different sources that this brand is far higher than the others, contrary to the statement posted on the Nature's One website. **3/13/12 For anyone interested, we have officially switched to the Holle brand of infant formula. Our daughter has been on this formula for almost 2 weeks, and she took to it right away. There is plenty of information, along with user reviews from around the world, online. Unfortunately, it is not available for sale here in the US. Please see the source I have been ordering from in Germany that offers relatively moderate shipping fees in the comments. If you have any questions about the Holle products, please leave a comment, and I'll get back to you at my earliest convenience. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW: I ordered this formula because my wife is starting back to school in a couple of weeks, and won't have the ability to breastfeed or pump as she has been doing. I have read much of the info from the manufacture's website, and the many online reviews. Even with the occasional constipation some users have had, we decided to give this a shot. Our 4 month old daughter (wow does time really fly with them) took right to it. My wife tasted the formula, and said it is sweet like breast milk tends to be. We had tried another brand since we get free samples, and it must have been awful. Our daughter didn't like it one bit. We haven't had an issue with constipation, however she is still receiving breast milk, which may be helping with that. We are hoping that my wife will be able to pump enough in the mornings and evening, before and after class, to keep a supply, and only really need to supplement with the formula, which is only twice a day currently. I also really like that the manufacturer is an advocate of breastfeeding, and that is why they label their products for 12+month infants. You also can't go wrong with the 3 pack price that Superstore offers. Plus is comes with free 2 day shipping using Superstore Mom Prime. UPDATE: Our daughter is now on this formula exclusively. She hasn't had constipation issues as other reviews have mentioned. Her bowel movements are firmer, and more solid, which makes clean up easier, and still regular. I wouldn't say she has any pain associated from this though. She still also takes to it wonderfully. There was never any problem with her distinguishing between breast milk and this formula. As a note, Superstore's price on this only saves us 1 cent per can compared to the local Whole Foods price. However, we do not regularly shop at Whole Foods as it isn't very convenient for us. The 2 day shipping is great, and very convenient. Just make sure to stock up while Superstore has it in stock. They seem to sell out quite often. ANOTHER UPDATE: 11/6/11 The Superstore price has increased on the 3 pack of this formula. It is no longer feasible to buy from here, so off to Whole Foods we go. Somewhat disappointed, as Superstore was saving us money, and valuable time. …",21 out of 25 users found this review helpful

The cooked up tender and tasty. I used some in a soup, added some to a couple of salads and blended the rest up to make hummus. Each time I reflected on how much better I liked them over canned beans (even when cooked unsalted) and the last batch of dried chick peas I bought in the store.

 Unhealthy Peanuts - Hope this review helps,1,"I bought these and the unsalted variety because I make homemade peanut butter. I should have paid closer attention to the ingredients. These peanuts include cottonseed oil, a hydrogenated oil. I don't know why they don't just roast them with peanut oil. Well actually I do know why: Peanut Oil is more expensive than cottonseed oil. If roasted with peanut oil these peanuts would be healthier and in my humble opinion taste better. I've switched to buying peanuts from The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg ([...]), which are also available via Superstore Prime though unfortunately not part of Superstore's Subscribe and Save Program. I just bought the last 3 cases (two unsalted and one salted) though so you'll have to wait until they get more. They are more expensive but better quality and healthier food normally is more expensive. If you care about your health, stay away from hydrogenated oils and, accordingly, stay away from Planter's Peanuts. Once you become accustomed to the taste of unadultarated peanuts you'll never go back. It's been a while since I wrote this review and today, 4/9/2011 someone commented about my original review and the higher cost of the Williamsburg Brand peanuts. Of course, generally speaking, unfortunate as it may be, we often must pay more for healthier foods. Accordingly I thought it would be a good idea to update my review. If there's a Costco near you, there's a Kirkland Brand salted peanut that they sell, in a rather large can. The peanuts are pure and unadulterated and only roasted in peanut oil; no unhealthy cottonseed oil like the Planter's. And, they are, I'm confident either less expensive or most certainly much more cost competitive than the Williamsburg brand to which I alluded in my earlier review. So, in this particular case, provided one has access to a Costco, one need not pay more for a healthier peanut. …",11 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 Bye Bye WAY overpriced Supermarket Corn!,5,"I regularly pop corn in a wok with canola oil. Nothing fancy, pops like a charm. My local supermarket chain (VONS) used to sell those old plastic bags of corn for like $2. You know -- those old fashioned bags that just sit there while everyone else buys all the microwave garbage. Well VONS slowly marked up these bags to about $3 over the years. Then one day they were all GONE. Replaced with Orville Reddenschmucker like 'jugs' of unpopped corn. Just under two pounds of corn for --- WAIT FOR IT -- $5. I have to pay MORE money and get more container but LESS corn?!? I don't THINK so... So I start surfing the web. My God -- some site was willing to sell me a 50 pound bag for like $18. My cheapness grinned ear to ear. Then I saw the shipping charge --- WAIT FOR IT -- $43. Yeah... no... So then I see this brand at Superstore. 12.5 pounds for $17. Shipping? FREE. And I don't have to store 50 pounds! Just over a dollar a pound instead of twice as much? SOLD. Now it's home. Just made a batch. I'm not a gourmet -- it's frickin' popcorn, okay? To me, it's either a pass or a fail. Better than Von's, the same, or unacceptable. It's either better or the same as Von's -- I can't tell. It seemed to pop bigger, but I'm not sure the bigger popping translates to better taste. Why are you still reading this?

 Guns don't kill people. Shady meat producers do.,5,"This product is not inherently evil, despite what the reactionist one-star reviewers would have you think. It is used by the finest restaurants to create unique cuts of meat. When you eat pasta made from shrimp or a filet of duck and rabbit meat, you know they where fused. Europe banded it not because it's unsafe, on the contrary they found it safe, but because it can mislead consumers. europeans are more into real food than us, like raw milk cheese, preservative free bread, and beverages lightly sweeter with real sugar. If you doubt this, ask a european what they think of chicken nuggets with cheese on wonder bread with a 46oz coke, yuck! While I can understand why some people would find gluing meat strange, there is no cause for this outrage. There are tons of thing that the meat industry in this country does that actually endanger our health and violate basic tenants of human compassion. Meat glue is not one of them. Please, stop posting one star reviews on a product you have never tried, and if you must, don't use straw man justification to prove that a natural product is dangerous. Truth is, frankenmeat and imitation crab are wrong not because they are dangerous but because, like much of our food today, they are sold to perpetuate the American notion that meat should be so cheap that it becomes the basis of every meal. So only buy good meat, and eat less of it.

" Tasty, no vitamins, made in China, deceptive packaging",1,"While these are tasty snacks, there is virtually no nutritional value in them. A quick check of the label shows insignificant amounts of and vitamins, even vitamin C, in any of the varieties. By insignificant, I mean less than 10% RDA. That is far below what one might find in the claimed 1-1/2 apples or pears per package. I will add that under ingredients, the only thing listed is the freeze-dried fruit on the label; there appear to be no additives, not even sugar, of any kind. While they are not strictly bad for you, this snack certainly qualifies as empty calories. Frankly you get more vitamins from a bag of potato chips. In addition, these are made in China, this is stated on each envelope. Draw your own conclusions. Finally, the package counts are deceptive. The subtexts often says ""24 count"". Then in Superstore inset says ""2 pack"". This leads a reasonable person to believe they are getting 2 24 packs for a total of 48 individual snack envelopes. In fact these are sold in packs of 12 (TWELVE) and you get two of them for a total of 24. I find this deceptive, or at best, confusing. [Update, May 2012: It appears that the description of the item has been changed to avoid the confusion as to how many you are actually getting.] To conclude, these are tasty, the texture is good, there seems to be no odd ingredients, refined sugar or artificial stuff and the serving size is reasonable. However, the utter absence of any nutritional value tells me that the process used to ""freeze-dry"" these seems different from other freeze-dry methods in that it is particularly destructive to nutrients. I find the fact that they are made in China troubling. Finally, the deceptive package counts found here in the product descriptions lead me not to purchase this again.

 Something has changed in the last few months,2,"I've been eating Chicken of the Sea chunk light tuna for years. I preferred it over other common grocery store brands because the tuna came in good sized chunks (similar to the consistency of solid white albacore of other brands) and was generally very good quality. In the last several months, something has changed. As another reviewer noted recently, what you get now is a can full of finely chopped up mush that is much darker in color and not nearly as tasty. I thought maybe it was a fluke and I bought a bad can, but I've gone through about 10 straight cans over a 4 month period, and they've all been of the same substandard quality. Perhaps the company started cutting corners or using inferior quality fish to improve its profits; whatever the reason, I cannot eat this trash any more and am on a search for a better tuna fish. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" This is good, but it's far from the best.",3,"Don't mean to be the one who rains on the bandwagon (pardon the metaphor crash), but, while it is definitely true what other reviewers have written -- that the coffee is very strong, very thick, and very dark (add in an acid level commensurate with the sludge-factor) -- I don't find the taste all that strong, and taste is important. True, these K-Cups will provide a pleasant-tasting beverage the consistency and color of Louisiana mud, but for taste, one can do a lot better. Just for kicks, I had K-cups of coffee back-to-back today, one of this type and one of K-Cup ""Mini-Brewers"" Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold , which is, unfortunately, sold out at the moment. True, Newman's (RIP) is hardly as dark a roast or as thick a beverage, but the flavor punches through very robustly and is totally superior in the area that counts the most to me -- taste. It's a lot ""Bold""er than this brand. One of my favorite dark roasts is the Coffee People line, even of decafs, which truly bury the ""Big Easy Bold"" in the taste department, too, even if one drinks the decaf. Diedrich coffees come to mind as well as clear winners. Maybe I'm spoiled, but I tend to use fewer of the ready-mixed K-Cups brand coffees than employing the My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter and selecting my own brand and grind. My current favorite brand of coffee comes from a pair of small roasting houses in Washington state and Alaska. I keep a couple days' worth ground and ready to put into the My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter s, and there are few pre-packed ground K-Cups that can come anywhere close to the richness of the flavors and choices available if one ""rolls one's own."" I've got nothing against Emeril's, and it's a far superior cup of coffee to anything you'll get in most restaurants.

" ""Health"" Does Not Always Equal Health",1,"It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong. I lost it gradually and within recommended weight loss recommendations (1-2 lbs a week). I didn't starve myself, stop my social life for any diet's decrees, and I definitely wasn't under the tutelage of any one diet. I have done that already and realize a few things: 1) you must exercise daily, 2) you must mind calories, 3) you must eat 3 meals and 2 snacks every day, and 4) the types of nutrients matter (omega 3, 6, and 9 fats, thermogenic herbs, antioxidants, etc.) The greatest myth I busted was any form of perfectionism. If you have a candy bar once in a while, that doesn't mean you are a big failure, you have to start all over, and you might as well do that next week (so you can binge in the meantime). All diets are perfectionistic. They focus on one aspect of healthy eating and run with it to fit the lose-weight-overnight / Can-I-also-have-a-pizza-with-all-the-fixings? mentality of the typical deluded American. That's why we have the Atkins diet, illustrating the worst of this concept. However, these diets aren't bad, because you can extract a jewel of knowledge from each of these regimens. Atkins taught us to watch carbs and not to fear protein (although that doesn't mean you can eat bacon); Fat Flush teaches you the difference between good and bad fats, thermogenic herbs (that raise the metabolism), and a very basic understanding of the Glycemic Index, and Thurmond teaches you what combinations of foods work to lose weight and the power of eating many small meals throughout the day. Larabar is another great example of the focused diet. The jewel is the omega fats 3 and 6, gluten-free, no dietary sweeteners (which increase your appetite and studies have correlated artificial sweeteners to weight gain because of its high glycemic index count), and it being all natural, organic, and kosher. That's great, when you focus on only this aspect. But still, however popular diets have become, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and the like can never be ignored. The one irrefutable truth is the calories you take in determine what your weight will be in the immediate future. If there is a high fat percentage, which are calories still, you have to consider that. LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES! These health bars are healthy, but I would only have them as a reward before or after a good workout. This is the first review that I am rating this low because of the padding I suspect going on. One reviewer talks about the low calories, which is totally false. Two reviewers talk about how healthy it is, sounding very close to an infomercial as he focuses on only one aspect but ignores another. The suspicion arises when these two reviewers rate this bar 5 STARS 3-4 FREAKIN' TIMES WITH THE SAME WORDS! They must mention the excessive calories and fat in these bars, or else someone's going to go off of insufficient information and eat one every day with a sedentary lifestyle. Compare this bar to a Snickers, and you may have a different perspective. What is labeled ""healthy"" can be very bias. MY POINT BEYOND LARABARS: You can't focus on one system of ideas, because health and nutrition and weight loss are much larger and much more demanding concepts of nature's effect on the body. It's how you sustain and develop habits and balance in life, and it's about the knowledge you keep in your head, so you can deftly cut corners through increasing your metabolism or burning the maximum calories. It's about myth busting. It's about making smart choices. It's about knowing what choices are in the first place; if you choose one path, you can't choose another. Sacrifices may be what your particular body requires to be healthy and lose weight. You won't find a real chili-dog diet. You won't find a sugar that tastes exactly like sugar. One path leads to one place, while the other path leads to another. Note the difference, and be realistic. Lastly, the only health change you can make overnight happens in your head, not in your body. …",39 out of 151 users found this review helpful

" So good, I don't want to tell you about it!",5,"I'm reluctant to share all the recipes of things we're using Bob's Red Mill potato flour for. Why? Because they're so good, once people try them, it might start selling out! Oh, what the heck. You talked me into it. I'll share a couple of them anyway. For delicious gluten/grain-free chicken nuggets: Start with a pound of skinless, boneless chicken, cut into nugget-sized pieces. We use dark meat, because it comes out moister and more flavorful. Pat the pieces with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Next, combine the following in a quart-size Zip Lock bag. You can adjust the seasonings to your own taste, of course: 1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp Bob's Red Mill potato flour 1 tsp salt 1 tsp onion powder 1/2 tsp garlic powder 1/2 tsp paprika 1/2 tsp white or black pepper 1/2 tsp dried parsley flakes, crushed to powder Put half the chicken pieces in the bag, zip it closed and toss gently to coat the chicken. Remove the chicken pieces, shaking off the excess coating back into the bag, and cook them in a little oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. It's important to cook over medium-low heat like that, because potato flour can scorch. Using tongs or a fork, turn the pieces occasionally until lightly browned and cooked through. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces. Once you try chicken made with potato flour like this, you may never want chicken made with wheat flour again. :) For a quick and easy, dairy-free, gluten-free, tapioca-like pudding -- yes, pudding: Bring 1-and-a-half cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add a pinch of salt and 1/4 tsp baking soda to the water. (The baking soda will neutralize the potato ""tang"" of potato flour.) Add a generous dash of vanilla extract. In a small bowl, use a fork to stir together a quarter cup plus 2 tbsps of white sugar, and a quarter cup plus 1 tbsp of Bob's Red Mill potato flour. Remove the saucepan from the heat (this is important -- you don't want the thickening mixture to boil and spatter on you). Gradually pour the dry ingredients from the bowl into the hot water, stirring the water with a fork to mix while you do. The mixture will thicken instantly. (No matter how much you stir, there will be some lumps. So if you don't like lumps, either don't bother with this recipe, or take an extra step of pushing the mixture through a sieve.) Allow the pudding to cool. We usually hasten that process by placing the saucepan in a sink half filled with cold water. We also use potato flour as an extender for wheat-free meat loaf, and as an extender and coating for chicken-fried steak. (Cook in a skillet with a little oil over medium low heat so the potato flour doesn't scorch.) We also --- Okay, I'm not going to tell you any more. I've said too much already.

There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption. Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers. However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly. It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.

" Vegan, organic sugar",5,"Farmers produce coconut palm sugar by making slits in the buds of a coconut tree to collect the sap. The sap is boiled until it thickens and then dried into hard cakes, which are ground into powder (see photo of the sugar I posted above). Coconut palms grow under drought conditions in sandy soil. They not only use one-fifth the water and soil nutrients of sugar cane, they also enrich (vs. deplete) the soil and produce 50-70% more sugar per acre. The Big Tree Farms brand of coconut palm sugar is not mixed with any other type of sugar as some other brands are. It is a 100% organic, natural sweetener which is not filtered or bleached as white sugar is. When sugar is bleached, the process involves using ground up animal bones, thus, this non-bleached sugar is vegan. The major claim to fame of coconut palm sugar is that lab tests have apparently shown that this product has a glycemic index (GI) of 35, compared to agave nectar at 42, honey at 62, cane sugar (sucrose) at 64, and date sugar at 103. A low GI is 55 or less. A medium GI is 56 - 69. A high GI 70 or more. Those who are concerned about the environment and humane labor practices will approve of the fact that this product is sustainably produced by smallholder farmers on the island of Java, Indonesia. All of the money earned from growing, harvesting and processing this sugar stays in the local community that produces it, and Big Tree Farms states on their website that they work directly with international, non-governmental organizations to create and maintain supply chains for this product that are ""transparent and socially equitable."" I purchased this particular brand of coconut palm sugar as a substitute for white and brown sugar in dessert recipes because my husband is a vegan and I'm on a ""mostly vegan"" diet. I have uploaded photos above to show the chocolate cookies I made using this sugar. (Note that I also substituted coconut oil for butter.) My husband and I love the taste and texture of these cookies, and I will definitely continue using this product. If you are not a vegan or vegetarian, there are two issues that might affect your decision as to whether to invest in this product: First, the claim of a very low GI of 35: Big Tree Farms states on their website the following: ""pure, organic coconut palm sugar is typically 70-79% sucrose, 3-9% glucose, and 3-9% fructose."" They also state that they believe the high sucrose content is what makes the GI level so low. I find this explanation confusing, because this product is touted as a healthy substitute for table sugar, which is 100% sucrose. The logic of how this sweetener, which is 80% sucrose, can have only 55% of the GI rating of table sugar that is 100% sucrose makes no mathematical or scientific sense to me. Second, the high cost: If you are not a vegan or vegetarian, I'm not convinced that the presumed health benefits of this sugar make it worth the extra cost and hassle of obtaining it. You can conveniently buy brown sugar at your local supermarket for about 89 cents per pound and white sugar for about 38 cents per pound--and they often go on sale. That's really cheap, and the GI is not ""high""--it is ""medium"" at 64. In contrast to that low cost, this product sells for between $4-$5/pound. Since a pound of any kind of granulated sugar consists of 2-1/4 cups, that comes to $1.78-$2.22/cup for this product compared to 40 cents/cup for brown sugar and 17 cents/cup for white sugar. But, you might ask, isn't refined sugar bad for you, and isn't this much-less-refined sugar good for you? Actually, few health experts believe that any sugar outside of that found in whole, unprocessed fruits and vegetables is healthy. But few of us have the willpower to completely give up sweets. Hence the goal of trying to keep the GI levels as low as possible while eating them. A much cheaper way to do that than buying this sugar is to use a couple of tricks I learned during the years I spent on the Zone and Atkins diets: (1) Bake your sweets with any sugar you please and consume protein at the same time you eat the sweets in a Zone or Atkins ratio. (2) Make the baked goods themselves have a definitely lower GI by decreasing the carbs and increasing the protein content. Substitute stevia, lo han guo and sugar alcohols for table sugar, and plain protein powder for wheat flour (which has a GI of about 71). If you are completely convinced that ""natural"" sugar is healthier than table sugar, this product is certainly less expensive than some other alternative sweeteners you can buy and doesn't have some of the problems they cause when substituting them for table sugar in baked-goods recipes. For example, lo han guo ( Sweet ) sells for around $17-$22/pound and sells for between $54-$70/pound (both of these are also vegan, by the way). Marketers of lo han guo and stevia claim that those sweeteners are over 200 times as sweet as table sugar. I personally find this claim to be grossly inflated. To my own taste and that of my family, lo han guo is about 8 times as sweet as table sugar, and stevia is about 16 times as sweet. Regardless, the fact that they are so much sweeter than table sugar means that if you try and substitute them for it in a recipe, since you don't need nearly as much of them, the texture and ""mouth feel"" of the finished product simply isn't the same. For uncooked foods, though, such as smoothies, tea and coffee, lo han guo and stevia are great. In contrast to lo han guo and stevia for baking, (at about $2.60/pound), sugar (at about $4/pound), and this product have the same sweetness as table sugar and can be substituted in a ratio of 1:1 in recipes for cakes and cookies, allowing the recipe to retain a similar taste and texture to what it has when made with table sugar. Sucanat, however, has about the same GI as table sugar, and date sugar's GI is through the roof at 103, the same as for dates, because it is made from finely ground dates. …",67 out of 69 users found this review helpful

 chocolate + coconut = Heaven,4,"I am a huge fan of coconut and chocolate is my weakness. The manufacturer mixes both to create a pretty good product with Cacao Bliss. When I first received this jar, I was not too impressed. The appearance of the product was that of stale/old chocolate. It was crumbly when I tried to dip my spoon in it. I had anticipated a creamy substance. This product is not creamy out of the jar. Unless the entire jar has been left in the sun or in a hot spot, don't expect to dip your knife or spoon in and spread it around on a piece of toast. In terms of eating options, I do recommend heating the product. While I now enjoy eating it in its solid form out of the jar, heating some of the product creates a substance that can be spread easily on toast. I also like taking shavings of this product and sprinkling it on cupcakes. The coconut and chocolate flavor is a subtle addition to any sweet treat. I will note that the flavor took some getting used to. It probably took three to four samplings before I started to really want to eat spoonfuls of the product. I think with any new product that has a slightly different consistency and flavor there is an adjustment period. I'm glad I didn't give up on it and took some time to experiment with how it could be used. I will be incorporating this product into gift baskets for both my vegan and non-vegan friends and family. It is recommended that this product not be refrigerated. A snapshot of the product's nutrition facts can be found in the product image gallery. As a vegan product, there is no milk, eggs, honey or other animal-based substances that go into the formulation of this product. According to the product packaging, this product is ""made in a facility that processes tree nuts and soy, but does not process peanuts, gluten, dairy, cholesterol or GMO's."" This product is also sugar cane free. Considering that Superstore typically packages products in sets of 2 or 6, it is nice to be able to purchase one jar without committing 40 or 50 dollars on a bulk set of 6.

" A healthy, somewhat expensive food.",5,"These berries are thought to be one of the one of the healthiest natural foods. There are many ""stories"" about the amazing benefits of these berries, many of which may be true, but a few verifiable facts about them (in dried form) follow: 1) High protein (about 12%), and are a complete protein. This is good for anybody, but particularly noteworthy to vegans, who choose not to get their protein from meats. 2) Decent fiber content (about 10%) 3) 18 (!!) amino acids 4) Like most sweet fruits, high in carbs and calories. 100 grams give you about 350-380 calories; roughly 3/4 from carbs and 1/4 from fat. 5) 6 vitamins, 8 amino acids, 11+ minerals (more in trace amounts) 6) Carotenoids, unsaturated fatty acids (this is a good thing), phytosterols (help lower cholesterol), and other healthy (or theoretically healthy but not particularly well researched) phytochemicals. Enough with the technical jargon. These berries are great in cereal, smoothies (once hydrated), and tea. For tea, try this: Put water, a small number of berries (6-15ish) and a teabag in your cup, microwave for about a minute per teacup (time varies), drop a small amount in your favorite tea along with the teabag and let the berries and tea steep for about 3 minutes. This adds a subtle character to green tea (plus an unusual, tasty snack to do with a few of the sips). The flavor seems to blend well with chai and jasmine too. This may work differently for those who use creamer. Of note: - If you let them soak for too long (more than about 5-10 minutes) they get mushy and lose their texture and flavor. - If you do not soak them long enough, they can feel a little bit gritty. I think this is due to the seeds. I don't mind it myself, but some might. I recommend that you try a bag, keeping in mind that you may need to soak the berries in water/tea/whatever in order to make them soft, and see what you think. I have found they make a great addition to my usual cereal-only breakfast because they give me a much-needed protein boost. If you like them quite a lot, you may want to take the time to look for a supply in a nearby Asian foods store. I have heard they can be purchased at a lower cost in bulk.

On Monday morning I tried to make my espresso with some of Trader Joe's Espresso Blend, and while I love the Trader's, their espresso is horrible. Finally at lunchtime I was able to find some Illy.

Because of that, it will compete with the flavor of most foods, not compliment them. This sauce will not be a component of what you are eating, it will be THE flavor, dominating all else. That's OK for bland dishes, but a disaster for others that have already complex flavors.

Well, here goes: Sugar free with only 3 calories per serving, they are sweetened with xylitol, which occurs naturally in the fiber of many fruits and vegetables. Xylitol has virtually no aftertaste, and doesn't impact blood sugar, so diabetics can enjoy them. With these, I haven't noticed any tummy discomfort as I do with Sorbitol or Aspartame. I don't really consider these as candy in the normal sense, but more as a refreshment. These pastilles are a wonderful treat that can help prevent cavities by keeping the saliva flowing. This is especially helpful for those of us who are stressed, have a medical condition or take medications that can cause dry mouth. These pastilles are firm but chewy, and also melt in one's mouth. There are no sharp edges which can occur with some hard candies. The taste is distinctive, rich and pleasurable, with notes of licorice and menthol. A serving is two pieces, with a total of 12 servings per box (which is small enough to discreetly carry in a pocket or purse.) Lakerol Special Licorice pastilles come in handy, too. Ever need to change the subject in a hurry? Offer one of these. Got the munchies at 2:00 a.m. but want to wake up free of guilt? Forget the cake and have a couple of these instead! Mouth going dry on your way to the principal's office? (Or enrolled in a speech class?) No problem. These will help! Bored stiff trying to do your taxes? Lakerol and a stroll away from your desk will help refresh you... and with luck you will think of a couple more deductions. If you suffer from arthritis or any other source of chronic pain as I do (ankylosing spondylitis), these may help distract you from the pain and help you proactively focus on doing something kind and positive for yourself, such as gentle stretching or a hot bath. These do have menthol, but are not overwhelmingly strong, which is a nice plus. If you have a sensitive mouth, as I do, this can be very comforting. Also, I'm a chocoholic, but more often than not these stop those cravings and reframe my feelings to something more positive. My husband and I both love these and wouldn't want to be without them. Whoever invented them must be a genius! I've ordered them multiple times through Superstore and am extremely satisfied. My order often arrives within four days or so. What more could I ask for? I hope you try these if you haven't before.... they really are special. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 taste is satisfactory - not yummy,4,"I have been drinking coconut water for one year now. It has really helped me improve my health. I get far less headaches that is for sure. I used to wake up with terrible headaches and after tracing everything it could possibly be and getting rid of those triggers, I still had headaches. Now, I drink at least 10 oz of coconut water per day and my headaches have been cut by 75%. At night, I will often hydrate before bed. At the gym, I put it in my sports bottle. It is so much healthier than the Alligator Ade and colored vitamin waters. During gym days, I'll drink as much as 22 oz. It's just pure coconut water with so much potassium. Low potassium can cause muscle cramping and cardiovascular irregularities. A can of this stuff is perhaps one of the quickest ways you can hydrate and help yourself if you are experiencing symptoms of heat stroke or severe dehydration or JUST feeling a bit sluggish. It has been an amazing experience for me. Google ""potassium and health"" and you will see all the benefits of just a few guzzles. A banana has about 450 mgs of potassium while 10 oz of coconut water has 650 mgs. Also, it is soothing on my stomach and doesn't exacerbate car sickness and IMO, is best very cold. About this brand, ""Nature Factor"". I purchased it here on Superstore as it was on sale. I like the can (vs. the box) because it chills in the frig better, but I would have to say it's not the best coconut water. It's not bad, it's just not YUMMY. It has a satisfactory taste, almost a non existent taste. Whereas other coconut waters, such as ""O.N.E."" and ""Harvest Bay"" brand tastes really good and ""Vita-Coco"" tastes sour-horrible. I do not buy the waters with added sugar. That defeats the purpose of the healthy drink and it really doesn't need any added sweetness if it is a good, clean coconut water. Also, instead of stocking my earthquake emergency stash with water, I have stocked with cases of coconut water. Think about it. If you need to hydrate during an emergency situation where resources are limited, wouldn't the electrolytes and benefits of coconut water be better than just plain old water? Each gulp would be 5 times more beneficial. If you are curious about coconut water, this is a decent enough brand to give it a try. Since they all taste so different, it's interesting to try all the brands to see which one you prefer. Good health to you all. …",50 out of 53 users found this review helpful
 Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.,5,"UPDATE: The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great. Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution: I have been buying the ""Organic Liver for Dogs"" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Superstore. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product. I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Superstore are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets. As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem. Unfortunately, Superstore doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally). UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me. I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars. I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well. I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars. Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" excellent tea, recommended to take a fenugreek supplement as well",4,"This tea is really really good! It's worth drinking for the taste alone! I started drinking this tea when my baby was only eight weeks old and my milk supply already started to dry up. I also recommend taking fenugreek and milk thistle with this product ( (610mg) 100 Capsules + FREE Milk Thistle Powder 25 Grams ). I drank the tea by itself for the first week but then panicked when my milk supply only slightly increased. I don't think there is quite enough fenugreek in this tea because I added the fenugreek and milk thistle after it being recommended to me and literally the next day my milk supply was back in full force. Did I say the tea tastes great, always a plus! …",27 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 I LOVE this stuff,5,"I'd been buying it for years WHEN I COULD FIND IT, at the local grocery. Generally buying 5 or 6 cans cause I couldn't be sure it would be there next time I went. As such, I was thrilled to see Superstore selling it in bulk and cheaper than at my local store. These are almonds... so you get the health benefits of that. They are very tasty, with a mild wasabi tang... I've shared them with friends and they love them. Granted, these don't provide the entertainment value of the wasabi peas from the Japanese place that blow out your sinuses. But Its still a very tasty, semi healthy (lots of salt), snack that fills my need for something crunchy. MUCH healthier than potato chips. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Sugar is natural,1,"If you are anticipating peanuts, salt and nothing else, this is not for you. Sugar is a major ingredient as well as some type of added oil which I assume keeps the naturally occurring peanut oil in suspension (i.e., you don't have to stir this one to mix the peanut oil back into the peanut butter). Sugar may make this more appealling to the kiddie set, however. If you are mixing true ""natural"" peanut butter, try using a hand mixer with a single blade; hold the jar tight, and mix away and in 30 seconds you're finished (unless you didn't grip the jar tightly enough, in which case you have to clean the kitchen, too). …",5 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 the best  organic food you can feed your fur babie,5,"since we began using this several years ago our senior dogs raely need to visit the vet.

No more vomiting, Made with bells & evans chicken the same chicken sold at whole foods & other organic food sellers. If its good enough for you, it's good enough for them.

 Excellent Coffee,5,"This is one of my favorite K-Cups out of the 20 or so we currently have on hand. It just has a very satisfying flavor, not too strong, not too weak, not bitter. I put about 1/3rd of a teaspoon of sugar and about 3 Teaspoons (one tablespoon) of 1/2 & 1/2 and its just perfect. I personally buy this from Bed Bath & Beyond because amazingly it is cheaper there. I get 20% off coupons from them about every 3 weeks, in fact get 2 because I have my wife get them at her work also so we get 2 a month plus sometimes a $5 off of $15 coupon on top of that. So I pay $8.15 (after tax) for a pack of 18, that works out to $24.45 for 3 packs (54 K-Cups) so much better deal than $38 for 48. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

" TERRIBLE compared to others, many shells",1,"I LOVE cacao nibs and I so much wanted to love these, as they are a small organic company from Ecuador. I bought these, Navitas and a generic brand, from Peru at my local food store to compare. Compared to the other 2 these were of terrible quality, both in appearance and taste. They look washed out, and don't have the fresh, sort of oily look that the other raw organic cacao nibs I bought had and are much smaller pieces. They are about half the six of others on average and the bag included much of what I would call cacao nib powder. Their taste is less pungent and their texture a bit dry, less cool and crispy than others. The biggest problem with them is that the bag is FULL of shells, which are not chewable, and must be picked out. You cannot eat them in crunchy delicious handfuls at your desk.... or even pour them into a recipe. Actually, you have to meticulously inspect each small group of them for shells, which are hard to tell from these super small nibs. Anyway, for the best quality I would go with Navitas or another brand that you can see in person before you buy. From my experience if they look good they are good! I hope this helps. …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful
