 snack food heaven,5,"These are wonderful! They're definitely chocolate, but not overpowering. The sea salt provides a nice foil, so you can eat a whole bag by yourself without going into a chocolate coma (maybe that's bad). They're just sweet enough to make the chocolate happen. They're like ""hint of oreo"" without all the garbage and without all the guilt (unless you eat a whole bag in one sitting). I've had them with a peach salsa, which was nice. I think they'd go really well with a fresh fruit salad. They'd go well with ice cream, and they're perfect with a tart, plain yogurt. I dipped them in hummus too, and while it doesn't not work...I'm not sure it's great. Still, basically they're versatile and not too bad for you. When you find yourself at the bottom of the bag you can always say, ""well, at least it wasn't a bag of oreos."" …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 do NOT drink unless you can pass out!,5,"This stuff is incredible. I picked up a few bottles for my husband who's a big Marley fan and also happens to enjoy tea... Before he got to them, I had about half a bottle one afternoon while we were playing with our kids. I sat down on the couch and ended up taking a nap (which is something I never ever do). Guess I should have read the label first! I thought it would just relax me, not put me to sleep - so now I drink a half bottle before bed. Sounds cheesy, but it quiets my anxious mind. I sleep SO well with this tea and I wake up feeling happy and refreshed (not weighed down and grumpy as I usually am in the morning). Keep in mind, I'm a lightweight at 117lbs and 5'4. NOTE: I found this at the store at 1.50/bottle... I'm really bummed that Superstore jacked up the price here. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 I want to give this a better review,2,"This almond milk tastes great! It has a great flavor that is similar to cow's milk with a nutty flavor. If I think the taste is so great then why don't I give it a better rating? Unfortunately, there is no calcium in this un-enriched version so I can't really use it as a milk substitute for my children. When I can find an enriched version on Superstore, I will definitely renew my Subscribe and Save for that one. …",10 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Horrible for dogs. Toxic ingredients.,1,"I spent 5 years studying canine nutrition and it's because of hype marketing such as this that dogs have such increased health issues. This is created for profit rather than for pets. Why do I say this? On the label it says ""100% Real"" Note that it doesn't say real WHAT. So then you see ""No artificial flavors or colors"" and you think you are giving your dog real beef, right? Nope. Turn the package over and look more closely. Yes, it has beef but guess what the second and third ingredients are? SALT and SUGAR. After that we have smoke flavor, potassium sorbate (an artificial preservative...note it said there were no artificial flavors or colors. It did NOT say no artificial ingredients and it did not say all natural.) then Caramel Sodium Erythurbate, then Sodium Nitrate, (Sodium nitrate, a chemical preservative) forms nitrosamines - carcinogens known to cause DNA damage and increased cellular degeneration. Studies have shown a link between increased levels of nitrates and increased deaths from certain diseases including Alzheimer's, diabetes mellitus and Parkinson's in humans, possibly through the damaging effect of nitrosamines on DNA.Nitrosamines, formed in cured meats containing sodium nitrate and nitrite, have been linked to gastric cancer and oesophageal cancer.Sodium nitrate and nitrite are associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer.World Cancer Research Fund UK,states that one of the reasons that processed meat increases the risk of colon cancer is its content of nitrate. A small amount of the nitrate added to meat as a preservative breaks down into nitrite, in addition to any nitrite that may also be added. The nitrite then reacts with protein-rich foods (such as meat) to produce N-nitroso compounds (NOCs). Some types of NOCs are known to cause cancer. NOCs can be formed either when meat is cured or in the body as meat is digested...the next ingredient is then BHA. The US National Institutes of Health report that BHA is reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. In particular, when administered in high doses as part of their diet, BHA (a preservative) causes papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach in rats and Syrian golden hamsters. THEN ONION EXTRACT. ONIONS ARE TOXIC TO DOGS! It is unfortunately true that many companies add sugar as a main ingredient to treats so that dogs will crave treats...they do not brush their teeth so you are entering bacteria into their mouths on top of what is already there and this eventually actually affects their livers and kidneys. With onion ingredients you are hurting their livers and kidneys more by having to filter out this toxin on top of all the artificial ingredients. They are smaller than people and it's far more difficult for them to process these ingredients than it is for us. There are dirt cheap jerky treats for dogs that have all natural ingredients. Don't fall for the false labeling. The very fact that they label this as they do proves what's important to them...not knowledge of getting the best for your dog, but filling it with cheap ingredients for profit. As someone who has studied things like this for years as well as the beneficial affects of a natural diet, this simply sickens me. …",13 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Izze drinks related to Fibromyalgia type pain,1,"I was drinking a bottle or two of these per day to help me lose weight (these got me off Pepsi). I began to have very bad skin pain and muscle pain in my side and arms, wrists after about 2 weeks of drinking these. I was going to the doctor for the pain and was about to be diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. I started an elimination diet as a last resort because I had not always had this pain (only recently). After stopping the Izze drinks just by chance because I ran out and the store I was getting them at did not have the flavors I liked, the pain went away. This pain was very bad. I was becoming a person who could not have my children or spouse hug or touch me. My clothes hurt where they touched my sides. It hurt to sleep and lay on the mattress with my side. I may be the only person to experience this and realize it may be some kind of allergy to some product in this drink. …",9 out of 45 users found this review helpful
 Love it!,5,"I have a 8.5 month old Aussie mix. She's about 42 lbs now. This food is magic!! I love it! She's never been ""food motivated"" and so she's always been a little reluctant to eat her kibble, but she honestly LIKES this stuff. She'll do tricks for it like it is a treat. More importantly, her poop is GREAT on this kibble. Finally, it's easy to pick up! This food is a godsend. We've previously tried Innova EVO, California Natural Lamb and Rice Puppy and Adult, and Canidae All Life Stages. Innova EVO gave her the runs, but she was a new puppy. (The pet food store said EVO was rich enough for puppies. My vet disagreed.) California Natural seemed better, but her poop was always so soft that it was messy to pick up, and she never really liked it. She liked the taste of Canidae better - so much so that she would pick it out when I mixed it with the Lamb and Rice. However, her poop didn't really improve until we shifted to Orijen. Magic. This stuff is magic, I say. Besides being the magic food for my dog, it's also made in Canada with almost all Canadian ingredients. From what I've read, they get rice from California and Lamb from New Zealand, but otherwise -- everything comes from farms in and around Alberta. No food recalls on this brand!

 Good value,4,Good beans for a fair price. Drinking coffee in large volumes precludes indulging in some of the finer roasts. Going this way one can indulge one's coffee habit without breaking the bank or resorting to supermarket canned ground coffee. After finishing this bag of Brazilian Dark I will probably try a bag from another part of the world. Brazilian coffee is mild and smooth whereas I prefer a coffee with more of an edge. …,16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 This one supplement has changed my life!!!!!,5,"I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.) None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life. That is, until Natural Calm. This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically! Here are the things this supplement has helped with: Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night. Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations. Mood--- Made me generally happier. Decreased muscle cramping and soreness. Improved gums and teeth. Improved hair loss. Improved digestion and transit time. Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too! But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really. There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Superstore if you want more science of magnesium.) I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement. If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want. Here's wishing you great health! …",37 out of 46 users found this review helpful

 It's disgusting.,1,"I was hoping for honey mustard goodness, since it has the same color as Portillo's amazing honey mustard. This tastes like it's made with mustard, salt water & a hint of sugar. This must have been invented by a pregnant woman. I was not raised on this & would never recommend it. I actually came online to find out if the ""Famous"" in the title was just a gimmick to make me buy it. I also came online in order to write this review so nobody else has to be subjected to this. If you want to try this sauce, just go to a salty California beach instead & drown yourself. I'm sure it would yield the same result. …",0 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 Don't like,1,"I have used quality salts for years, and have always especially loved the pink salt variety, so I ordered this one because it is much cheaper than others out there. Well, this one just doesn't taste like the pink salts I've had in the past. Upon tasting, I also I realized that this salt is just 'too pink' for me to believe that it is not enhanced in some way! I've never seen this salt look that way before...but hey, it is entirely possible that it is truly that color without additives...so I went to the source and wrote the company to find out. That was weeks ago, and they never bothered to respond. So I am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a Himalayan pink sea salt. What's funny is, on every container of salt I've ever purchased there is an ingredients list...NOT on this one. (If it's pure, then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient...the salt. But sometimes, even in sea salt, there is an added anti-caking agent added so it will be listed there.) Anyway, Superstore is wonderful and refunded me for this salt, so I will purchase a different brand. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Recommended only for special occasions,3,"You've heard the saying: If it's too good to be true, it probably is... Well, I received my Whey Low products and made some mini vanilla cupcakes (a low-fat recipe using shredded zucchini) topped chocolate butter cream icing. I used the Whey Low D (for diabetics) in the cupcakes and Whey Low powder for the icing. Both products certainly performed better than Splenda (and even the Splenda for Baking sugar/splenda blend). It looks and tastes like sugar in the cupcake recipe. It baked up beautifully and browned nicely. I was very pleased with the Whey Low D's performance in the cupcake. The Whey Low Powder at first looked like it was going to make great butter cream icing, but after spreading it on the cupcakes, it began to loosen up and turned into a thick glaze after a short while. The taste is sweet, but the icing was grainy in texture. Within a few hours, the icing had begun to run a bit down the sides of the cupcakes and by morning it was a wet puddle at the bottom of each cupcake. So, it did not perform like ordinary powdered sugar in this recipe. I think it would work fine for making a glaze or for dusting the top of a cake, but not for a real cake frosting. Also, I would suggest eating it within a few hours of application, otherwise it will break down and be a mess. The results were quite disappointing and only slightly better than Splenda in this type of recipe. The unfortunate news is that the mini cupcakes did raise my blood sugar to some degree, so you can't expect your blood sugar to not be affected. I ate three mini cupcakes for my test, then I checked my blood every 30 minutes for about 1½ hours and it went steadily up from 150 to 202. Whey Low declares that it's 70% lower in calories than regular sugar, which may still make it a good choice for cakes and cookies over using regular sugar if you want to make a special dessert, such as a birthday cake once a year. But I don't plan to replace Splenda in most of my cooking because of my blood sugar results. NOTE: Ordinarily, I wouldn't have eaten three mini cupcakes in one sitting, but I did this time because I wanted to see how my blood sugar would react to a larger dose of the Whey Low in what might be a normal serving of cake (and one mini cupcake wouldn't have been large enough). Whey Low is not the miracle I hoped it would be, but I'm glad to know of an alternative to Splenda for baking cakes and other baked pastry sweets. I very rarely make them, but on my birthday or at Christmas I do like to have a piece of cake and have it taste ""normal."" I will reserve Whey Low for these rare, special occasions. Sorry folks! I guess we still can't have our cake, eat it and not feel the effect on our hips and in our blood sugar readings. Darn..... …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Excellent; A great alternative compared to Starbucks Green tea lattes,5,"I purchased the matcha powder in hopes to replicate the green tea lattes at starbucks. Starbucks matcha powder contains more sugar than matcha, so i thought Id try creating my own. This product is amazing and tastes exactly like the green tea lattes. I chose not to add a syrup, but it would work very nicely. To have a similar green tea latte like starbucks i use this recipe: 1 cup of hot milk separated (I use skim) 1 teaspoon of matcha powder 3 tablespoons of hot water. Sugar/Splenda (optional) Choice of Flavored Syrup (Optional) First disolve and mix the hot water with the matcha powder. Get all the clumps out before continuing. Then add about 3/4 cup of the milk to the matcha water mixture and mix to completely blend. Using a frother, froth the remaining milk until it resembles a foam. (I also purchased a small travel frother from Superstore) Add it to the top of the latte. Add sugar/spenda if desired. Add syrup if desired. …",83 out of 83 users found this review helpful

" Good, if you like MSG and nothing else.",1,"Note that the description provided by the...(?)...producer or merchant of this product says it's filled with ""gurlic."" Maybe that's true.

 Ajinomoto Hon Dashi,5,"I buy this locally in a much larger box but it is the same product. This product is just as good as making your own, which I did for years before finding it. The larger box has 1,000 servings but that is for a weak dashi so I use double the granules. For this product with the 3 packets, just add them into a small jar and use 1 ts per cup hot water (adjust to your tastes). That adjustment is why it says '3 to 6 cups'. Also, this product stores with no loss in flavor in a sealed container for years. I actually have some in a salt shaker (with rice to keep it dry) and use it commonly as a flavor boost to vegetables (green ones especially work well with it). This is actually a good starter size box. For those not sure what to do with it, a sample recipe: 3 cups made up dashi (1 packet)- taste and add water if you wish it weaker. 1 packet Udon noodles (may use cooked spagetti) appx 1.25 cups volume 1 cup lightly packed leafy vegetables (spinach, mustard greens, cabbages etc) Optional- baby bok choys whole, shellfish (whole or chopped), peeled shrimp, miso Bring to a simmer and as soon as the veggies and optional meats are done to your liking, it's ready.

 Something Unique,5,"Lapsang Souchong - 'Russian Caravan' as it is commonly known - is a truly exceptional Chinese tea, and it is done proper justice by the ladies at Culinary Teas. A generous teaspoon of Lapsang Souchong steeped for about three and a half minutes in roughly 190-200 degree water will yield a strong, flavorful cup of the Fujian Province's most notable tea. What is so respectable about Culinary Teas' Lapsang is that it manages to contain immense flavor with very little of the aftertaste common to lower-grade Lapsang Souchong. But how does it TASTE? The answer is both mysteriously complex and blindingly simple. A quick sniff of the pine-needle-roasted leaves brings forth the aroma of a campfire; this flavor carries well into the brewed tea, creating a strong, smokey aroma and flavor that does not fade as the tea cools. Culinary Teas' evenly fired, full-leaf Lapsang Souchong ought to be placed at the top of any tea enthusiast's shelf as the strongest, most impression-making tea in Culinary's collection. One does not forget the first experience with Lapsang. Do it right by using this brand. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Beware new formula!,1,"Be very aware that the new formula ALS is not agreeing with a lot of dogs. I have one of these dogs and no amount of transitioning improved the diarrhea, vomiting, and hot spots.

Canidae made major changes to their ALS formulas and did nothing to alert the public until they had to (their web site only). There is still nothing on the bags to make people aware of the changes except a new ingredient list. Do your homework before buying this dog food.

 PET FOOD RECALL WORRIES?  NO PROBLEM WITH NEWMAN'S!,5,"Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets. Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural. In doing this research, I found out that not only does Newman's company make salad dressing, as we all know, but ALSO a VAST variety of human and pet treats as well! :) I got a great deal through Superstore on this pack of six bags, so I got two flavors and sizes for my dogs. They are ALL natural, and when you touch them yourself and feel the texture, and see the actual oats and cheese or whatnot for yourself, you will be so happy you are feeding them to your pet instead of **** food. People have no idea just how awful most name brand pet food is and that it is really like the equivalent of feeding junk food to their kids for every meal. But it's not our faults when pet food companies are abusing our trust. Get these treats. You and your pets will be healthier for it . . . physically, mentally, spiritually. …",33 out of 34 users found this review helpful
" These seeds are a ""Product of China""",1,"They taste fine, but don't be fooled by the package into thinking this is American-grown and natural. It all looks good - ""Woodstock Farms"" name, company based in Connecticut, bucolic image of a rustic farmhouse, ""Caring about the Land"" slogan, all the pseudo-natural, pseudo-green trappings companies use to hook you into buying a product that's not as good for you or the environment as you could wish. I doubt that Woodstock Farms has any actual control over how these pumpkin seeds are grown or processed, and we all know from the news that China isn't overly concerned with food quality control or truth-in-labeling. I will avoid all Woodstock Farms products from now on. I will also not buy any more food products off Superstore unless it is explicitly stated where the food was grown. …",14 out of 18 users found this review helpful

For the price, two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this. Also, with this syrup, you have the option to how strong or weak you'd like to make each serving.

 A fine bowl of porridge,5,"McCann's is ""just"" oatmeal, but it's perhaps the best oatmeal widely available in the United States. It's made from nothing but 100% whole grain oat kernels which are grown in Ireland and cut in a device similar to a burmill. The cutting technique provides a much firmer and more complex texture than the rolling which is used on commoditized oatmeal products available in the U.S. This is not an ""instant"" or ""quick"" oat product, and these oats have not been precooked at all. What this means is that McCann's Traditional makes a great bowl of porridge with a fresh grain flavor and an al dente consistency. This is oatmeal with a natural crunch and tang to it. Rolled oats -- especially instant, sugar-added, flavored rolled oats -- don't come close. The obverse of this is that you are actually cooking these grains rather than merely heating and stirring a pre-cooked product. Be prepared to spend some time -- a half hour or so -- in your kitchen watching over these and stirring them with your spurtle (porridge-stirring spoon). Consider this a luxury, an excuse to slow down for a while. You can find cooking ideas and great recipes at goldenspurtle dot com, which is the home page for the world porridge-making championships. Specialty porridges, made with fresh fruits, liqueurs, and cream sauces, make distinctive desserts if you really want to get creative. A few more things: these oats are kosher, the can looks sharp, and they make great cookies. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

" A perfect ""Anytime"" coffee that is sure to please.",5,"I have tried many, many brands and blends in my Keurig coffee maker and this is definetely one of my favorites. The type of coffe I drink depends on my mood. Sometimes I want a strong, bold cup like, Newman's Own Extra-bold Special Blend K-cups, 80 Pk for Keurig Brewers and sometimes I want something more mild like, Mountain K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108-ct.- Nantucket Blend But ever since I have had my Keurig I have been looking for one of my favorite coffees. The Dunkin Donut brand. This coffee is superb and very much like the Dunkin Donut brand. Not bold or bitter. Not weak or under flavored. It is smooth and very flavorful. It is the perfect crowd pleasing blend for any time of day or night. I have shopped all over and you can't beat the variety or the price here on Superstore when you join their club. A great value. I do wish that Superstore would change the name by removing ""Extra Bold"". It is not. It is, at most, a medium roast.

" Good Value, Moderate Taste",3,"Having grown up in sugar maple country and bought syrup from the farmers in unmarked gallon cans ('store syrup' never entered our house), I have plenty of experience with maple syrup. [Tip: maple trees and maple syrup are 'organic' by definition. Farmers who tap trees add nothing. Don't pay more for 'organic'.] At our house we 'sugared off' every Winter. For those who know what I'm talking about, read on. For those who don't have any idea, you may be happy with this product. The Good: This syrup is priced right (purchased at $17.31). It is a good buy and you should not be shy at purchasing. It's really about a 3 star minus or 2.5 stars. The Not So Good: Grade B syrup is normally 'mapley' with caramel notes. This syrup LACKS the strong maple flavors that make it suitable for cooking or a good match for those who like strong flavors, but it does NOT have the complexity or finesse of a Grade A Amber. In short it is rather bland and pedestrian for maple syrup. What we don't know is whether the trees tapped for this label vary from year to year but this batch is uninteresting. I bought it as an alternative to Whole Foods label (about $20) but quite frankly the Whole Foods Grade A Amber has a stronger maple flavor with more complexity and the Whole Foods Grade B is significantly stronger in flavor. I would rate the Whole Foods Grade A Amber as a 4 star minus, and the Grade B as 4-5 stars. …",168 out of 192 users found this review helpful
" BAD, do NOT buy!",1,"Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!! Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry.

 Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.,5,"UPDATE: The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great. Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution: I have been buying the ""Organic Liver for Dogs"" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Superstore. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product. I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Superstore are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets. As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem. Unfortunately, Superstore doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally). UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me. I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars. I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well. I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars. Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Great energizer!!,5,"I bought 5 individual packages of different types of protein drinks to see which I liked before I committed with a whole container. This was excellent - I mixed it with orange juice and proceeded to play 1 1/2 hours of tennis - singles and not once did I feel hungry.

 Wonderful!,5,"I was given a box of this when I purchased my kitten. He loves it and we love it. It scoops well, isn't dusty, is safe for kittens and isn't scented (I am chemically sensitive so this matters a lot to me). Even if he ate it it wouldn't harm him since it is just wheat. If I keep the minimum of 3"" level in the litter pan it doesn't stick to the bottom. I've been amazed at how well it scoops. I just scoop it morning and evening and it doesn't get smelly at all. You may want to get this locally since, after shipping, the discount usually works out about the same. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 How Could You Be So Bold,5,"After FINALLY purchasing best coffee maker I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Superstore, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold. Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold. What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's. There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Superstore. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam! …",27 out of 28 users found this review helpful
 Great product overall,4,"Summary: Great (if kind of gross) product for distracting my puppy, but there is a slight choking hazard. My crazy but adorable Boston Terrier is extremely high strung and suffers from separation anxiety. These sticks were recommended to us in order to help distract her while we are away from home. When I first gave her a bully stick, she immediately waltzed off with it and proceeded to find somewhere to ""bury"" it; which was fun because she had never done that before with a treat. Now I find bully sticks in the laundry hamper, under my pillow, between the couch cushions, and other strange places (she once tried to hide one under my arm, which really didn't work out too well for her). When she gets around to chewing on one, she happily munches away. Between the ""hiding"" and the chewing, Chompers is occupied for quite some time. The sticks look really nasty once they have been used for a while, but they don't smell or leave marks on the carpet. Now for the down side: While safer than rawhide, these treats do occasionally choke my dog. The hard stick turns soft and stringy when chewed on for long periods of time. Since the dog can't really bite the stringy stuff off (hard to explain unless you see it), she will try to swallow stringy stuff attached to the remainder of the stick and choke on it when it gets caught in her throat. This is not a problem when I am home because she get my attention when it happens and I can pull the stringy stick parts out of her throat. When we leave the house, we have to make sure all the stringy bits are cut off of her sticks so she won't choke while we are away. I don't know if anyone has had similar problems (please let me know if you have found solutions!!!) but it was a little scary at first to see her choking. I'm not sure if she would be able to resolve the choking situation without our help. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 For Better Bread,5,"This adds wheat protein which helps your bread rise. I started putting this in all my yeast breads and the results were fantastic. If you make whole wheat bread in a Bread Machine this stuff is a must. If you use cheap (low protein) flour this stuff is a must. A little goes a long way. You don't have to be exact. Once you open the box it needs to be refrigerated to keep it fresh but it's best used at room temperature. (Although I used it cold and I got decent results.) I not going to buy this thru Superstore 'cause I can't use 8 packs of wheat gluten. You have to look for this in flour section of your supermarket or in a health food store. Unfortunately, It is not carried everywhere. …",36 out of 38 users found this review helpful
 Can't Beat Nutiva's Organic Coconut Oil for Taste or Texture,5,"I first tried coconut oil last fall after reading The Coconut Oil Miracle (***highly recommended book***) and Nutiva's Organic Coconut Oil was the first I tried. It spoiled me completely. I've since tried two other brands and NOTHING tastes as fresh and light as this oil. It has a nice coconut flavor and personally, I love the taste it gives fried eggs and even pancakes. I also used it to make a pie crust (after chilling the oil slightly to compensate for the friction of working the pie crust) for a coconut cream pie and it was out of this world--flaky and delicious!!! Like another poster, I also like it spread on a toasted English muffin and then topped with a light drizzle of honey. Our family has changed our eating habits in the last year and now we use only 3 fats: 1. Coconut Oil 2. Butter 3. Extra Virgin Olive Oil (but only raw---never with heat!!!!--use the coconut oil or butter for fried & sauteed foods). Our general health is much improved; my husband's cholesterol levels are finally dropping (after YEARS of using ""SmartBalance"" and other ""healthy"" spreads that just raised his cholesterol). Try this coconut oil and do yourself a favor and order Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil) so you can understand why it not only tastes so good, but is so good for you! …",48 out of 50 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Tasty berries!,5,"These supposedly have some of the highest levels of antioxidants of any food, which is why I bought them. But I really like the taste too. It's not too far off from a cross between a tomato and a strawberry, but a very little bit bitter at times.

 This is the Best,5,"McCann's (in the tin) is nothing like the tasteless mush that passes for oatmeal in the U.S.. True, it does take 25 minutes and sometimes you need to fool with the water amount and/or the flame until you figure out what to do to get it exactly as you like -- too high a flame, for example, does away with the water before the oatmeal is completely cooked, but remember you don't want it to cook so long that the special consistency is lost. I've cooked it for years but even so when I took a can to our country place where we have a propane gas stove, it was as though I'd never made it before. However, the finished product is well worth the time. Even unadorned or with just a bit of grated nutmeg, it has a satisfying crunch and slightly nutty taste. My husband, based on bad childhood oatmeal memories, initially turned up his nose at the thought of eating oatmeal; he likes it so much he makes it for himself several times a week. Two of our younger grandkids accustomed to starting the day with cold commercial cereal ask for the ""special"" oatmeal when they visit. Additionally, it's substantial; a serving at breakfast easily holds you till lunch time. PLEASE NOTE -- what I've written refers only to McCann's in the tin; I've never tried the flakes. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 Amazing customer service,5,"When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert ""3-4 mm"" to inches and consequently discovered the ""Coarse Grinder Salt"" was almost 1/4"" (1/6"" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder. Shortly after receiving my order from Superstore, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order. I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill. Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge. That's amazing customer service! …",25 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 Not what I was hoping for,3,"Since I am diabetic, I have tried every artificial sweetener on the market. For me, all of them have too much of a bitter aftertaste to be usable. I had read that xylitol is more or less a 'natural' product, and after having heard a professional chef give glowing reports of Ideal (xylitol) on a radio program, I ordered the three bulk forms of the product. It tastes fine in beverages. Of all the sweeteners I've tried it IS actually the closest to the taste of sugar, with the least noticeable aftertaste. It does measure like sugar, too, as advertised on the package. However, baked goods made with the granular, confectioners' and brown sugar mixtures of Ideal product were unsatisfactory. Cookies made measure for measure with Ideal were mealy and did not brown. There's no way to get a crisp cookie or moist cake because the xylitol does not carmelize, so the only texture it contributes is dry grainy-ness. I suppose the radio chef raved about the product because he was trying to sell his cookbook dealing with the use of xylitol as a sugar substitute. I will continue using Ideal in my coffee, but not for baking. I'm very disappointed that Ideal does not perform at all well in baked goods. …",23 out of 27 users found this review helpful

 My new favorite chocolate,5,"I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to Lindt Chocolate, especially their Dark varieties. 85% has been my primary indulgence for awhile, with some 99% on occasion. Then I discovered 90%. It is truly a confection masterpiece. I expected it to be like 85% but darker or like 99% but sweeter. It isn't, it has a totally different flavor, rich in cocoa, lighter on the bitterness. I actually find it to be much smoother than 85%. For those that don't like Dark Chocolate, please realize that like wine, coffee and dark beer it takes a little bit of time to acquire the palate to appreciate the complex flavor. But if you go slowly, starting with 65% and going up to 70, 85% and 90% as your palate adjusts, you will discover how wonderful it can be. When you're starting out, don't chew on the chocolate, just let it melt in your mouth. I find that when I eat milk chocolate, it tastes good but it never satisfies me. Dark chocolate is different, it is rich and deeply satisfying. Enjoy your 90%, Nicky p.s. This used to be much cheaper on Superstore! Now it's outright expensive.

The price is very competitive with the local grocery, and shipping was fast. This is easily one of the best rice blends I have found. And it is NOT seasoned, so you do not have to contend with high sodium content or other problems. You make it the way you want it--cook it in broth, add vegetables & herbs and some diced chicken or leftover beef for a quick skillet meal that is head & shoulders above a boxed skillet dinner.

Using 100% whole wheat is also great in banana bread and other uses. The half and half biscuits were as light as usual and much tastier. I will buy this again, and again and again.

 WARNING -- read reviews--Canidae has changed their formula.,1,"My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet. Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea. My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks. After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet! Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill. My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula. Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae. …",20 out of 23 users found this review helpful
