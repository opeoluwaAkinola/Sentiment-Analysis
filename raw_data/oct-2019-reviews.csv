 Super Cuppa Java,5,"I am a coffee drinker of the first order. I used to drink a couple pots a day, but now I've cut way, way back, so now that I'm not into quantity, I'm into quality. I really enjoy, really savior a good cuppa joe. I've given up my Mr. Coffee and now have a Home Brewing System and I make my coffee a cup at a time and I really love it. It only takes a minute to make a cup and each cup is different, depending on my mood. I've been drinking K-cup coffee for a couple years now and have more of these little cups in my house than you can shake a stick at. For awhile I used a Carosel , made by Keurig, but I had to keep filling it and also it was kind of clumsy for me. Besides, my coffee affliction is way to huge to be held down to a little spinning coffee merry-go-round. For the first few months my coffee problem went spinning out of control. I had boxes and boxes of coffee in my pantry, refrigerator, cupboards, garage, even in the trunk of my car, but now I've sort of got my gourmet coffee disorder in hand and down to twenty-eight flavors. For Breakfast I have my favorite seven and they are: Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Fair Trade Nicaraguan, Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Bold, Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend, Tully's French Roast Coffee K-Cups, Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast, Timothy's World Coffee, Morning Blend and Coffee People Coffee, Wake Up Call Bold. For Lunch I have my favorite seven and they are: Gloria Jean's Coffees Hazelnut Coffee, Emeril's K-cups, Big Easy Bold, Gloria Jean's Coffees, Black Gold Extra Bold, Timothy's World Coffee, Private Blend, Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Parisian Nights, Timothy's World Coffee, Colombian La Vereda and Gloria Jean's Coffees GJ Special Blend And for dinner, yes I drink coffee in the evening as well, but that's not so bad, considering I don't drink alcohol, don't smoke, don't eat sweets and eat very little meat. Sometimes I'll eat meat, but not often, so a cup of coffee with dinner doesn't seem so bad, considering. If it kept me up at night, well then that would be different, but it doesn't. Anyway for dinner I'll drink one of these seven: Tully's Full City Roast Coffee, Gloria Jean's Coffee, Mudslide, Timothy's World Coffee, Italian Blend, Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups Dark Magic Extra Bold, Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark and Gloria Jean's Coffee, Classic Reserve. And then there is my absolute favorite, number twenty-two and that is Bold Rainforest Espresso , a Timothy's World Coffee. I keep my k-cups in three large assorted tupperware tubs, marked in red sharpie, of course, Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. So when I reach into the breakfast tub for example, I never know which of the seven flavors that I'm going to wind up with. I don't drink coffee during my meal, but afterwards, instead of desert. It's a quiet time for me. I think and reflect over my coffee as I delight in each and every sip. I know for some, having twenty-two different flavors of coffee in my kitchen might seem a bit much, maybe even a bit quirky, well everyone's gotta have their quirks, besides, I've cut way down. Now, about that twenty-second flavor. When I absolutely have to have an extra cup during that quiet, coffee drinking them, then that's the flavor I go for. How often does that happen, when one cup isn't enough? Only about once a day. Still, from two pots a java a day, down to four cups, is a pretty good thing, I'm not as wired as I used to be, but let's face it, I'm still running on coffee. That's not so bad though, better a coffee crutch than something else. In my opinion these are the twenty-two best cups of joy in the whole wide world. At least the best twenty-two flavors I've come across in the hundreds I've tried. But please don't take my word as gospel, everybody's different. You have to dive right right in, take a chance, try several flavors till you find the one or the twenty-two that you like best. …",16 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended,5,"This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway. After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)! It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again. Highly Recommended! …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Not as good as I had hoped,2,"I've been hooked on NOW's spearmint tea for awhile, and when that was unavailable for a time, I found this. I'd been wanting the benefits of green tea again anyway, and this seemed the ideal mix of the two, with the added bonus of peppermint and lemongrass. The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected. Now anything like this is going to be a matter of personal taste, obviously. I do recommend trying a single box if you can before committing to the case of 6. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 BumbleBee Ruined this New England Classic,1,"What the flipping hell did they do to my clam chowder?? Normally, I eat healthy foods. We are a mostly-vegetarian household, but once in a while, PMS demands that I have some clam chowder. Snow's Clam Chowder to be exact. It is one of my few comfort foods, and I spiff it up a little so it really is like a good, hearty, restaurant clam chowder. It is delicious and creamy and has clams and makes me happy. I picked up a can at Market Basket the other day. I noticed that Snow's is now ""Snow's by BumbleBee."" Ruh-roh, Shaggy. It smelled wrong when I opened the can. Not bad or spoiled, just not right. The texture was all wrong. The color was different. Since I am apparently a doofus, I made it anyway. This stuff truly sucks. It has NO flavor. It tastes pretty much like lumpy school paste. Only more bland. Not even salty crackers made a bit of difference. There was no warning on the label. Usually, when a company screws around with a tried-and-true recipe and ruins the product, the add a ""NEW! Improved!"" warning to the packaging to alert the public of their meddling. They didn't even do that. They just ruined it without any warning, and now my chowder is disgusting. I've been eating Snow's for forty years, but Look's will be getting my chowder business, now. It may well be a dollar more per can, but that's well worth it since they know enough to leave a good thing alone. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Found the solution on how to open it,2,"I bought this because I had been seeing this pod in magazines and other places. I thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro. However, this is very poorly designed. I could not open it whats-or-ever, even after searching through reviews after reviews. Finally, my genius boyfriend found the solution! Basically, you will need to open it from the BOTTOM. You will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it. You will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there's water in the pot. If any one who is reading this still having problem opening it. Let me know. I'll try to explain it better there. But anyway, this is a pretty useless product for its productivity, but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own, and wants a prettier fridge. You can make you own with a cup (or any container) filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb....(so unless you have money to waste, don't buy this useless pot). …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Chemical supplements should be taken based on the advice of a qualified health care provider,2,"As I have problems with sleep at night and tried all sorts of things which are most commonly recommended to improve it, I tought I try this well rated product. I tried it in all the various recommended dosages. But it didn't make the slightest difference for me. Thus I guess that it probably only works if the cause of the unrest is a magnesium deficiency. Reportedly: ""With supplements, overdose is possible, however, particularly in people with poor renal function; occasionally, with use of high cathartic doses of magnesium salts, severe hypermagnesemia has been reported to occur even without renal dysfunction"". ""Safety Issues The US government has set the following upper limits for use of magnesium supplements: Children 1-3 years: 65 mg 4-8 years: 110 mg Adults: 350 mg Pregnant or Nursing Women: 350 mg"" ""It has been called nature's calcium channel blocker."" ""Magnesium assists in calcium uptake, but it also competes with dietary calcium for the same absorption site in the intestine. Excessive dietary calcium (or phosphorus) is much more likely to block magnesium absorption than vice- versa in the typical American diet. Magnesium absorption is also inhibited by excessive dietary fat, phosphate, lactose, phytates and oxalates which form insoluble compounds with magnesium. Magnesium is also lost in diarrhea, long term use of diuretics, excessive sugar intake and protein malnutrition... ... there are lower levels of minerals in food today due to depletion of the soil in modern farming methods. (23) Modern methods of milling, processing and the preservation of food cause nutrient losses, eg 85% of magnesium is removed from whole wheat in the milling."" Thus it is advisable to consult a qualified health care provider if a deficiency is suspected.

 Good stuff and cheaper than vet bills,5,"I have three dogs, a minpin, a lab, and an aussie pup. My min-pin got sick recently. It was pancreatitis and kidney problems. His liver was a mess too. After he got out of the vet hospital (800 bucks later) they wanted him to eat a prescription food that they sold. He hated it. Would NOT eat it. I got the Wellness through a reccomendation and it has been a life-saver. My minpin is healthy now. His liver is fine, as are his kidneys and pancreas. He looks years younger with his shiny coat. My lab and my pup are looking fabulous as well. Whats ironic is that I WAS feeding a supermarket wet food and it was costing me 90 bucks a month to feed these guys. Now, it's cheaper, they are healthier and they LOVE it. I have never seen dogs freak over dry food like they do over this. If you can afford it, I highly recommend this product. It saves you money in the long run and makes your pets happy and healthy. …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 New formula - Yuk!,1,"Unbeknownst to me, the new formula was shipped to me. I used to love this stuff. It worked great and tasted palatable. I usually use less powder than what they recommend since I need a lot more water than other people. Now they've used stevia as the sweetening agent and the product is bitter and nasty tasting. It was so bad I thought the batch was off and was going to return it as defective! Then I saw the mention of stevia on the label. Oh...that explains it. That stuff doesn't taste sweet at all. It's worse than old school saccharin. Also they lowered the amount of calcium and changed other ingredients. It sounds like they reformulated to reduce costs. I can't use this rubbish. I want my money back and I'll have to try something else. …",12 out of 15 users found this review helpful
" Useful especially if you have a small kitchen, one safety concern though",3,"I live in a small apartment and don't have room for lots of gadgets (not even a microwave). I find this appliance to be worth the counter space. I like that you can steam and puree in one appliance, and that I don't have to lug out the steamer and blender to whip up some food. Some reviewers say your baby will outgrow this machine's usefulness in a few months but I disagree. My baby eats mostly finger foods but still I use the Beaba a lot. I use it to reheat leftovers (again, we have no microwave) and also use it to chop or puree adult dinners that are two hard for baby to eat. It's not a huge capacity but that doesn't bother me. After spending whole weekends steaming, blending and freezing veggies, just to discover that my kid's taste buds changed and what he once loved he now refuses, I'm over large scale baby food production. One safety note! There is a little hole that the lid clicks into. That hole leads to the water chamber and I once accidentally tipped the machine over and scalding hot water came out of the hole and landed on my hand. I got a nasty burn.

 great alternative,5,"I bought this along with the ""Baking with Coconut Flour"" book by Bruce Fife. The recipes I've made have all come out as expected which is good. My husband can tell when I've made something with coconut flour and he likes the flavor but my kids who claim to not like coconut don't seem to notice. They gobble it up regardless. I'm also replacing half of the sugar in my recipes with xylitol which further lowers carb count and is easier on blood sugar spikes. I've never used a different brand of coconut flour so I can't compare that way. It does seem expensive but I've never had a recipe call for more than a half cup of flour which makes your purchase last a long time. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Detailed reply from company over infant feeding and DHA/ARA,5,"MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Hey guys, So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs. So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks! THEIR ANSWER Dear Dave, Thank you for contacting Nature's One®. Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic® formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions. Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic® formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic® falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5. Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246. The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic® formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic® formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus. Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue. If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider. DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare. Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin. However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome. Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season. The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age. (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, ""The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children,"" Allergy 56; 5:403 I hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your interest in Baby's Only Organic® formulas. Please let me know if you have additional questions. Sincerely, Lori Nature's One Inc.

 What the heck did they do to the wrappers?!?!,1,"My family has enjoyed these cookies for more than a decade, and at our Christmas Eve dinner, we brought them out at the usual time, and started with the annual tradition of ""flying angels."" For those of you not familiar with these cookies, if you wrap them in a cylinder, and light the top, when the fire reaches the base, the wrapper shoots up in the air. It's actually quite a bit of fun. So imagine our surprise this year when NONE of the wrappers would fly. We compared old wrappers and new, and SOMETHING has changed about the wrappers. Whether it's wax, weight, or something else, none would fly for us (and we have an awful lot of people who are experienced with this).

If you have a lot of calcium in your system and not enough magnesium, those muscles can't completely relax!

" Outstanding, Bold, Lively Sumatran. best of the K-cups",5,"First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine. Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being ""tangy"" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich. IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4. I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc. Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star. Stale and bitter. I will definitely stay with Puck's. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 For Mixed Drinks Only,3,"I've been a fan of the original Starbucks VIA Colombian since its release, and had been keeping a close eye on my local retailer for the flavored varieties to be released, which they have inexplicably stocked roughly two weeks before the release date. The notably larger and heavier packages are sold alongside the original VIAs, featuring only six servings per pack. VIA fans will note the ""lightly sweetened"" remark on the front of the box, along with the addition of cane sugar in the ingredients list. The packaging is otherwise nearly identical to the standard VIAs, so you'll have to look closely to notice it. Mocha VIA dissolves quickly, much the same way as the original VIAs, but with a slightly milky hue. The mocha-coffee aroma is present, but the actual flavor of the coffee differs notably from the smell; both the coffee and mocha components are low-grade, with the sugar element coming in quite strong (""lightly sweetened"" means the same thing here as it does with Iced VIA - almost as sweet as soda.) The overall impression is office-quality bitter coffee with some condiment chocolate powder thrown in and a remarkably heaping spoon of sugar. This does not mean that Mocha VIA is useless; part of what made the original VIAs so popular was how many different ways they could be used in mixed drinks (VIA dissolves in cold water/milk/etc as well as hot), and I would wager that over time, there will be a sizable list of unique mix recipes for these flavored varieties as well. But without those recipes, most Starbucks fans who expect a rather complex quality blended coffee drink will be disappointed by trying to drink this straight. …",26 out of 28 users found this review helpful

 Replace your toilet and tub cleaner,5,"A 6-10% solution in H20 will clean your toilet and tub/shower just as well as commercial products and for pennies on the dollar. Citric Acid is actually the main ingredient in many tub and shower cleaners. It chelates mineral stains well, and is actually easiest to use sparingly from a spay bottle right after you shower. I just spray a little around, and after I dry off I rinse it with the shower head. It takes about 30 seconds total every other shower, but you never, never need to clean your tub or shower again if you do this. Be careful not to inhale it as it is still mildly irritating. Commercial products add some surfactants to help reduce mist and help it stick to surfaces, but with every-other-day-use I find that the h20 solution keeps the tub and shower perfectly clean and the chrome shiny without any real work.

" agave is unhealthy ...""low glycemic"" claim is misleading",1,"I was dismayed to learn that agave is actually highly refined fructose... worse for you than corn syrup. I had been so pleased with it because I didn't get a sugar buzz and though that was a positive thing. Do an internet search for article entitiled for agave-nectar-hfcs-in-disguise. Here's a quote: Yucca species, together with other agaves, are known to contain large quantities of saponins, according to Tyler's Honest Herbal. Saponins in many varieties of agave plants are toxic steroid derivatives, as well as purgatives, and are to be avoided during pregnancy or breastfeeding because they might cause or contribute to miscarriage. These toxins have adverse effects on non-pregnant people and many health compromised consumer categories as well. They are known to contribute to internal hemorrhaging by destroying red blood cells, and they may gravely negatively harm people taking statin and high blood pressure drugs. Agave may also stimulate blood flow in the uterus.(10) Other first hand reports indicate agave may promote sterility in women. Since the agaves used for agave syrup are not being used in their traditional way, there should be a warning label on the sweetener packages that it may promote miscarriage during pregnancy, through weakening the uterine lining. What's Wrong With Fructose? Once eaten, refined fructose appears as triglycerides in the blood stream, or as stored body fat. Elevated triglyceride levels, caused by consumption of refined fructose, are building blocks for hardening human arteries. Metabolic studies have proven the relationship between refined fructose and obesity.(11) Because fructose is not converted to blood glucose, refined fructose doesn't raise nor crash human blood glucose levels -- hence the claim that it is safe for diabetics. Supposedly, refined fructose has a low glycemic index, and won't affect your blood sugar negatively. But the food labels are deceptive. Refined fructose is not really safe for diabetics. ""High fructose from agave or corn will kill a diabetic or hypoglycemic much faster than refined white sugar,"" says Mr. Bianchi. ""By eating high fructose syrups, you are clogging the veins, creating inflammation, and increasing body fat, while stressing your heart. This is in part because refined fructose is foreign to the body, and is not recognized by it. So sad. …",7 out of 15 users found this review helpful

What I got was green apple (which is gross by the way!),strawberry (barely ok),cherry & chocolate (the only 2 good flavors in the bunch), blue raspberry, & watermelon (another gross flavor!). The advertisement blurb on the Superstore site indicated that the flavors were the original flavors (orange etc.). I didn't want to ship the whole order back so I just used the ones in the order (from the ""Toy Burg"" supplier) and am ordering again from another supplier that I had previously used that represented the correct box (this one being ""The Candy Co.""). So be cautious who you order from because the Superstore site does not indicate the exact flavors. I had to call to find out why I got the (wrong) misrepresented flavors & it wasn't easy even then to find out why I got the wrong type. The main lesson here is check your supplier and if all else fails you may have to use trial & error to get the correct item. …",14 out of 18 users found this review helpful

We do not care for traditional fruitcake, but this cake is very different. It's abundance of delicious high-end fruits and moist cake make it taste out-of-the-ordinary.

 New formula,1,"My dogs have been on Canidae for the past several years and even the picky dog who has lost over half her teeth loved it. However, I recently bought a new bag of Canidae. The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula. I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it. The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything. I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat. NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags. Their response: ********* Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas. ********* I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it. And when they say they are getting positive feedback from our customers that are *actually* feeding the new formula, are they trying to imply that I only pretended to feed the new food?!?! …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Quite possibly the worst product I have ever purchased in my life,1,"I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday. I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early. First of all, these are grossly overpriced. At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6. You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example). Even with the ""discounts"" that are offered through Superstore or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced. Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time: By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake. So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting. The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste. The awful taste. It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink. So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you. Otherwise, steer clear. The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever. I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day. Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy. I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now. I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review. I think it may have even given me a stomachache. So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go: Cons ---- Awful taste that doesn't go away Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have Doesn't actually give you energy Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption Jitters Inability to concentrate Might make you irritable May cause stomachaches Pros ---- If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter. Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product. It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life. And I've bought a lot of junk. Don't buy into the false advertising. Stay away. This stuff should be banned. …",16 out of 31 users found this review helpful

 High-quality kid-safe spray,5,"Though I'm hesitant to call this kid-safe, since anything that scares away bugs seems that it would inherantly be dangerous to little ones, everything that I seem to find leads me to believe that it won't harm my little ones. I've used it on my kids and neither had any kind of (immediate) reaction. I also took this to Liberia for a three week trip. If you've ever been to a place where Malaria is common, you also know how important it is to prevent mosquito bites. I didn't have a single bite, though I have to admit, I didn't see many bugs during these particular three weeks. I've also used it in Washington, DC, where even 25% deet doesn't always seem to work. Combine it's safeness with the fact that it doesn't stink (much), nor stain clothes and this is a no-brainer purchase. I also took a packet of the Cutter Wipes. The packaging is a tad wasteful, which I normally try to avoid, but they also worked well, with no risk of spilling, which is always a concern with sprays. …",24 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 Horrible experience,1,"I ordered these flowers for my mother's birthday, 2/17, on 2/16 in the early afternoon Mountain time to be delivered the next day. I expected 24 red roses in a red vase to be delivered just like the picture leads one to believe. The flowers never arrived on the 17th. When I contacted Pro-Flowers, they advised me that they did not receive the order until 10:39AM 2/17 and do not do same day delivery but the flowers would be delivered the next day. Ok, I can understand this. A day late is not acceptable but I can deal with it. Superstore must have had technical issues. The flowers were delivered 2/18. There were only 12 with a white vase. Of the 12, 8 were tiny roses. Nothing at all like the picture which is displayed. I spoke with Christine and explained the issue. She apparently had computer issues but could give me no information beyond the fact they were delivered because she had computer issues. She tried to transfer me to a supervisor, where I held for over 20 minutes and finally tried calling back. Spoke with Babbette, who pulled up the order. When I asked when the order was placed, she also placed me on hold for a few minutes. She came back and when I explained that the situation was not acceptable, she placed me on hold again for 5 minutes. At this point, she offered to replace them; however, the gift that I purchased to bring joy and a smile became nothing more than a headache. She blamed Superstore's system and beyond the fact that only 12 were delivered, they delivered on time. I will pay the additional money next time and order from another company who can deliver on what they advertise. …",71 out of 72 users found this review helpful

 Attractive alternative to Tassimo carousel,5,"I originally purchased the 5-bin carousel directly from Tassimo, and I wanted another one because I routinely use about 10 different types of T-Discs. For some reason, Tassimo stopped offering their carousel except to their ""European cafe collection"" customers. The only other carousel I could find was this one, the Nifty Home Products carousel. It is a little smaller, 4 bins instead of 5, and does not have the holder for the cleaning disc like the Tassimo holder. I didn't think I would like it as well. As it turns out, I like it just as well if not better. It is an attractive carousel, and it spins better than the Tassimo carousel. Although its capacity is slightly less, it is not bad. It can hold full stacks of 4 different T-discs, or, if you don't mind taking T-discs out of both the bottom and the top of each bin, it can hold half-stacks of 8 different T-discs. And the price on Superstore is great. I definitely recommend this carousel. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 Excellent product if you have a sweet tooth,5,"If you haven't tried this product you really should buy a bottle and experience it for yourself. I think that it is good enough that you won't miss the sugar. Water is so good for us, but so boring. If you are trying to increase your consumption of water, try a little of this in the water. This product can also be used to make an Italian soda (a little syrup, a little cream, and some sparkling water). Another yummy treat, if only they made a fat free cream it would be perfect. I have not tried to make an Italian soda using the Land-O-Lakes Fat Free half and half but it should work. My husband and I have been buying this brand of sugar free syrup for years. A pump of this syrup into your coffee changes it from a standard morning beverage into a liquid candy bar in a mug. I recently switched from half and half to soy milk in my coffee. With this syrup in my coffee the switch to soy milk was very easy. This product can also be used to drizzle on fruit if you need a little extract sweetener. The ingredients in this product (listed in order) are as follows: Purified water Vanilla extract with other natural flavors Potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate (to preserve freshness) Citric acid Xantham gum Sucralose (splenda brand) Acesulfame potassium Nutrition Facts label reads as follows: Serving Size: 1 oz.

 SUPER NATURAL SUGER SUBSTITUTE + TERRIFIC BRAND,5,"EXCELLENT SUGAR SUBSTITUTE HAS HEALTH BENEFITS + NO WARNINGS, This ""NOW Stevia powder"" is good stuff and this among the most economical and user-friendly ways to buy Stevia. WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT: Sweeter than sugar, that's what Stevia is, but that's not all. Stevia has been shown to lower blood sugar levels in research involving healthy adults by increasing the secretion of insulin making Stevia useful for diabetics. It also improves digestion and gastrointestinal function, and is useful for upset stomachs and to reduce gas and stomach acidity. Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart's muscle tone and promote the body's water loss. These properties are thought to contribute to lower blood pressure. Stevia also has antiviral, antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. It's used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss. ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE: There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research. FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States. AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT! Stevia can be substituted for sugar. It is a bit different tasting if one is use to sugar. I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as; 1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey. 2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar. 3]- Iced Tea. 4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup. MEDICINALLY SPEAKING: A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% ""steviocides"" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A. Duke, suggests in his famous, ""The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook"". ABOUT FORMS AND BRANDS: I prefer Stevia in powder over the packets, as I can better measure, and use what I need for each individual use. Purchase Stevia in whatever form you are most comfortable using. This ""NOW"" brand Stevia powder is an excellent product and a terrific value. ""Planetary Formulas Stevia Powder 3.5 oz."" is also excellent and it comes in a liquid as well. ""Swanson"" and ""Nature's Way"" are both excellent too, and have Stevia in powder, liquid and packets for convenient use. Any of the above choices are excellent, and I have used them all at one time or another, over the past 3-4 years on a daily basis.

 not the best for my cat,1,"I got this for my cat, thinking it was 'human grade', grain free, hence good for my cat. I realized the marketing is aimed at human sensibilities because it certainly looks and smells good enough for 'people' food. It may be great for some cats, but mine gained 2 lb since she's been eating this and I was feeding her much less than suggested. She also developed urinary problems. My vet who is one of the few vets who have studied nutrition, tried calling Weruva to find out more specifics about their food including calories, because many of her feline patients were eating Weruva and gaining considerable weight. The staff at Weruva would not talk to her or answer her questions and I couldn't guess why that would be unless their research has no real scientific backing to indicate this is a nutritious food. I tried calling them about week after that to see if they would tell me anything -- I got the same dismissive response. Pet food is not regulated and these smaller manufacturers can get one vet to review their ingredients and pay them off to say - 'hey this is a great, human-grade, grain free food'. While I've read the positive reviews about this food and some obviously find their cats love it, if your cat is gaining weight or developing urinary problems while on Weruva, think twice about buying it. …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful

They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food. This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.

Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.

The coffee itself is a wonderful (and, when purchased in the canisters, AFFORDABLE) treat. It isn't bitter or have an after taste like many instant coffees do. I was given a sample of the plain decaf packets when I made another purchase. They are a mess to open at your desk and get sticky trapping coffee as you are pouring them into a cup of hot water. No - Nestles - I don't think I should have to run the around the building with a cup full of instant coffee particles so don't even go there. I use a tablespoon of coffee. Bottom line is using packets will be a pain and very expensive. Perhaps if enough of us complain Nescafe will bring the canisters back. If you agree send Nescafe a message.

I'd never tried it before, but since it's healthy, I thought I'd give it a whirl and pawn it off on somebody else if I didn't like it. When I opened my first bottle, I thought it had a really strange, fermented taste and smell -- yes, sadly, I tried a sip of it -- and had a lot of thick, gooey pulp. I contacted the manufacturer @ (415) 775-6355 and asked them if this was normal. Apparently, they had a bad batch with their old manufacturing plant where the bottles were not being sealed properly and have since spoiled. She asked me some questions about the bottle, got some order numbers and cap numbers from me, and they are sending me out some replacement cases. They were very friendly, apologetic and helpful.

While it wasn't as much cheesy as it was garlicky, I had high hopes that ""nooch"" could satisfy the instinctual human need for Velveeta-style ""cheeze"". I could never find it at a grocery store OR a health store so I finally ordered this on Superstore. Wow. Yeah, I said wow. I used this in a recipe for ""Cheeze Sauce"" that was fat-free and it was amazing. Plus it had tons of protein, fiber, and of course the illustrious vitamin B-12! There are other similar recipes that call for LOTS of margarine that sound even cheesier and richer. This bottle lasted me about 2 recipes with a little leftover for sprinkling, so if you're new to cooking with nutritional yeast this is a good size to start with. I've since bought a 22-oz container of a different brand, but this brand is just as good.

 Smells WONDERFUL,4,"I had seen this cat litter at a kiosk at the Pet Expo in Del Mar, CA and had noticed how wonderful it smells. The litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. The sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the Florida company that produces Feline Pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the South. I tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. It is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. Any ""dust"" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem. As the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. I suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. The sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily ""stirring"", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore. The only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don't dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. The bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but I think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. The packaging also says ""CHEMICAL FREE..."" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. H2O (water) is a chemical. It should read ""HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL FREE"" or ""BIOTOXIN FREE"". Anyway, I'll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. Now that I've tried a premium litter, I'll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best. …",23 out of 24 users found this review helpful

" Great teapot, missing tuffy steeper",5,"This is a great teapot. It's attractive, well-balanced, and truly doesn't drip. The lid fits on with a plastic seal that is pushed onto the pot, which prevents drips even when the pot is tilted at an extreme angle. Inevitably, there's some sort of spillage involved with teapots, whether from the teapot itself (though not in this case), or by putting things into the water or taking them out. In order to deal with this, there's a channel around the lid that catches the water and holds it there, instead of all over the sides or the table. As a whole, it's very well designed and I'm pleased with the teapot. The only downside was that the Tuffy Steeper, which is stated in the product description as included, was not when I purchased this item from Superstore. I got a slight refund from Superstore, though not enough to buy the Steeper (which only comes in three-packs on Superstore, a fact which the customer service representative at Superstore couldn't seem to understand). Superstore's issues isn't the teapot's, however, so I would still recommend the teapot, especially if they've fixed the issue. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 fair (to good) subsitute,4,"Some reviews will tell you this is the best spice others will say this is fake tasting. To me and my bacon-loving-wife it's a fair substitute. If you use this ""salt"" you will get a bacon flavor and you will get a little salt. This product will give you a bacon flavor. The dishes I have used it most in is my baked potato soup. The soup turns orange, but I do get a bacon flavor without having to add bacon. This can be a good substitute when bacon is not around. It will not take the place of bacon in all cooking. The part of the bacon that adds the most flavor is the fat. This can not be mimicked. Also, one of the things bacon adds is texture. As I have said: good substitute.

After a local store dropped this product, I purchased two cases here through Superstore/factory direct for my friends and family. What I received is 12 leaking bottles with loose lids and 3 of them over half empty. I think Joseph's expects this because the outer of three shipping boxes was lined with a heavy plastic bag. The bottles read, refrigerate after opening, so for all I know, they are all spoiled. Joseph's has not responded to the E-mail I sent to their customer service and that is most frustrating.

When I found some information online about these pantry moth traps, I then came here to Superstore to read the reviews.

 RESEARCH THIS!!!,5,"I have now tried several different Matcha's. THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST I am very sensitive to substances that go into my body. Do your research. I did. I drink Green Tea for the health benefits. I am 61 years old now. My metabolism has slowed. My brain never tolerated caffeine very well. And, I do not want or like to be physically addicted to any drug (caffeine). When I was in Iraq, I drank caffeinate concentrated coffee (1 can of triple shot) per day. When I missed a day or two, my body went into a sluggish withdrawal with headache/stuffy brain. That was awful. I read about this Do Matcha Green Tea and how the other substances (Catechins, etc.) in it were so healthful and that the caffeine was low. I tried it and found there were no withdrawal symptoms after drinking one cup every day for a week. To my surprise it was just as uplifting as the Triple Shot had been, but with less than a third of the caffeine. It also had a very calming effect and produced a mental clarity I enjoyed in my 20's and 30's. The other Matcha's I tried because of cheaper price failed to produce the mental clarity. Mental clarity is what I missed the most in getting older. Only Do Matcha first harvest (Ceremonial Grade) has produced this. Read up on this so that I do not have to write so much to impart knowledge to those who do not know. I do not drink this for the taste. I drink it for the health benefits. The others DO NOT measure up to Do Matcha!!! You get what you pay for. Many extoll the different mixes they use Green Tea for. That is not me. I drink it straight with cool water. I don't want to lose any of the nutrition because of heated water. I use a battery operated frother to mix it. I like the veggie taste (like raw spinach). It is a quick drink that uplifts, enlivens, and clarifies. If you need to enhance your life. Pay for this. Yes, it is expensive... and worth the extra cost if you value your health. My body has become more supple. No more morning stiffness. No more morning grogginess. No more sore feet when getting out of bed. I have been using Do Matcha (and tried others) for 7 months now. I can quit without any signs of withdrawal. But, the age factors set in again. So, one cup a day of Do Matcha seems to be quite therapeutic for me. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Might not be to your liking,2,"After reading alot of favorable reviews here on Superstore, I decided to buy some early harvest Bariani from Fall 08. Overall, I was very turned off by the taste of this olive oil. I've tried quite a few olive oils (from low to high end) in my time and I've grown to like oils with a light grassy flavor with a bit of peppery punch. Perhaps it was due to the fact that Bariani uses unripe olives to make their oils but I found this one to be overly bitter. And it wasn't something that was subtle, I actually cringed a little bit on my first tasting. I will look elsewhere for my next bottle of olive oil. …",16 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Ceylon cinnamon powder,5,"Scientifically speaking, there is only one true cinnamon, which is most commonly called ""Ceylon cinnamon,"" and comes from the plant Cinnamomum zeylanicum. The other type of cinnamon which you find mostly in the grocery stores is called cassia cinnamon. If the label just says cinnamon, it is most probably cassia cinnamon. Why is this important? The term ""cassia"" never refers to Ceylon cinnamon but rather to other species of cinnamon, including Cinnamomum cassia (alternatively called Cinnamomum aromaticaum) and Cinnamomum burmannii. While most simply referred to as ""cassia,"" you'll often find Cinnamomum aromaticaum being referred to as ""Chinese cinnamon"" or ""Saigon cinnamon,"" and you'll find Cinnamomum burmannii being called ""Java cinnamon"" or ""Padang cassia."" Ceylon cinnamon is typically more expensive than any of the cassia versions, and it is also the cinnamon more closely associated with potential health benefits involving blood sugar regulation. To me, cassia cinnamon is stronger tasting while Ceylon cinnamon is more delicate. What true cinnamon and cassia do not have in common is their coumarin content. Coumarins are naturally occurring plant components that can have strong anticoagulant properties. Because our blood needs to maintain its ability to coagulate in times of injury, excessive intake of coumarins over a prolonged period of time can pose health risks. While the level of naturally occurring coumarins in Ceylon cinnamon appears to be very small and lower than the amount that could cause health risks, the level of naturally occurring coumarins in the cassia cinnamons appears to be much higher and may pose a risk to some individuals if consumed in substantial amounts on a regular basis. For this reason, organizations like the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, Germany have recommended that large amounts of the cassia cinnamons be avoided. Since it is harder to find Ceylon cinnamon in the grocery store, you might find it at places like Trader Joes or whole foods. I do not have either of those stores within an hour drive, so I get mine at places like Superstore which has it in bulk at very good prices. This particular brand is a good price on Superstore and I just re-fill an old shaker I have on hand from the bulk bag. This is good cinnamon and a regular in my kitchen. …",60 out of 62 users found this review helpful

 The classic!!,5,"Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey. Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal. Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface. Quote from the box: ""Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation."" Oscar Wilde. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful

It troubles me that they are unfindable. What troubles me even more, however, is that the bottom half-inch of my current (and last) jar has crystallized. Tupelo honey should never crystallize, so my assumption is that it's being cut with some other, probably cheaper, kind of honey. If you're looking for tupelo honey, see the website operated by The National Honey Board.

 Not impressed.,2,I was so excited to get this and try it. Unfortunately I'm not impressed. For starters the value is terrible. You get 3 cups of mix per box. That's enough to make 1 batch of pancakes and 1 batch of biscuits (or 3 batches of pancakes whatever). For almost 4.50 a box that's not worth it to me especially when the end result is mediocre at best. For the biscuits I made cheddar biscuits and not even the bread loving toddler would eat them. The pancakes were okay if I used twice as much real maple syrup as I normally do. The pro's? The biscuits did puff up nicely. That's the only pro I have. …,25 out of 31 users found this review helpful
 Why can't anyone make a hot cocoa without sucralose/Splenda in it?,3,"I HATE SUCRALOSE. Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising. That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition. Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run). There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find. My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me. So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option. Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere. UPDATE: I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing. UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets. I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself. So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant. 43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon. …",187 out of 216 users found this review helpful

Since I had been using Knox Gelatin for years I had no hesitation in ordering it. The price was a great improvememt over that charged in a grocery store.

" Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me",5,"I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store. I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie. In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion. Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me. This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber. While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar. Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

" Appears to be generic product, poor quality, no labeling",1,"I have purchased Bassett's licorice all-sorts before from Superstore, but perhaps not the same size bag; those previous orders were excellent. However, I recently ordered two of the 5 pound bags allegedly from Bassett's. They arrived in two unlabeled plastic bags--no brand name, no ""nutrition info,"" no list of ingredients--absolutely nothing. Nor was there a packing slip. The packing materials for the product were two empty, slightly padded priority envelopes that were empty. One one on top of the candy packages, the other on the bottom. I opened one bag of candy and tried a few pieces. They aren't fresh and don't have the usual Bassett's quality. Instead, they look like generic candy sold in bulk. I've no way of knowing if Bassett's is in any way connected with this candy. I can't be sure what is in them because there is no labeling whatsoever. If indeed these are Bassett's candies, the bags should have the logo on them; there should be ingredients lists; there should be a packing slip! Don't buy from Cherryfield Candy. It looks like they operate out of someone's basement. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful
" Hands Down, The BEST Cat Food... Saved my Cat's Life!",5,"I absolutely love this food, and so does my baby, Aphrodite! I absolutely recommend this food with no equivocations! Aphrodite is 9 years old and for the past 2 years, he's been having digestion and kidney problems that grew progressively more severe. About 6 months ago, it got so severe that I was sobbing at the vet trying to decide if we should put him to sleep. At that point, he was vomiting several times a day, had lost 5 lbs, and looked awful. Everything we had tried up to that point had failed. The vet suggested we try one more thing - a series of injections and a bunch of pills - and a switch to high protein wet food. Of course, my baby deserved a last ditch effort and we went ahead with it. After a hefty vet bill and 2 weeks, he actually seemed to be perking up! After another 2 weeks, it seemed that he would pull through. But the prescription food was costing me almost $2 per DAY! I had to find a suitable alternative. So to the internet I went. That's where I first discovered the Wilderness Diet by Blue Buffalo! With it's high protein content and wholesome, holistic, grain free (specifically corn) ingredient list, it's actually superior to the dry version of the RX diet. I ran to the pet store and to my surprise, they carried it. So I grabbed a small bag and headed home with fingers crossed. Aphrodite is a finicky eater, so the first test was whether he'd eat it at all. To my relief, he ran for it and LOVED it! So, I watched and waited. 6 months later, my cat is doing amazingly well! Esp. considering just months ago, he was on the verge of being put down! His coat is thick, shiny, and healthy. His eyes are clear and bright. And he rarely vomits - save for the occasional hairball! To maintain his health, I've switched to Bellyrubs Organic Bonito Flakes and Liv-a-Littles All-Natural Freeze Dried Chicken treats, as well! And today, Aphrodite is incredibly healthy, happy, and back to his old self. Now, if I can only do something about his wayward curiosity! =D …",51 out of 52 users found this review helpful

 Tasty but very fatty,3,"I fear that these spicy convenience foods are too high in fat to eat often. They taste well enough and will satisfy a craving for Indian food if you live far from a good source. Not really as good as ""the real thing"", but fairly yummy. There is a very high ratio of calories from fat to total calories on some flavors. As well as being to plentiful, I think the fats are saturated or hydrogenated and not well tolerated by my system.

" Great seeds, delicious sprouts!",5,"I just love alfalfa sprouts on sandwiches; however, over the months. I found that alfalfa sprouts were being sold less and less in the local food markets. It is my belief that the reason is simply that they do not have a long enough shelf life. It was this reason that I went online to Superstore and purchased this product. Knowing that seeds have a long shelf life, I stored it in my cabinet until I had the courage to learn how to sprout at home. It was a You Tube video that gave me the courage to begin sprouting. I do not know why it took so many decades for me to learn how to home sprout. Alfalfa sprouts usually take about three days or so to mature, and require no more than watering and rinsing with the final hours on the window sill for Mother Sun. The sprouts stay fresh much longer than I imagined because they are processed at home and are so very delicious. I highly recommend buying this vendor's seeds. They are perfect. One pound of alfalfa seeds lasts a long time. I guarantee that you will love sprouting seeds as I now do. Thank you so much for the lessons!

 A fan,5,"Ok, this stuff is the cure for family visits lol. I only had this stuff a week or so before going home to visit my very large and loud family that although I love dearly, can drive me crazy when it's unheard of to stay in a hotel. I drank this in the evenings and it is like it melted everything away including the anxiety of staying with my mother and dealing with her obsession of cleaning with her new mini sweeper, going here and there to see this and that person, having to of course spend extra money that I normally don't, AND having my Weimaraner at my moms hearing her gripe about what his claws will do to her wood floor. I know, too much information but seriously....I generally crack and I held it together this time. I give some of the credit to this stuff. Its taste is pleasant and it is easy for an on the go status like what I was. I recommend this to anyone who has a lot on their plate, especially if it is temporary and you aren't used to dealing with it all on a regular basis. That kind of stress can lead to a meltdown! I usually get sick with a really bad cold or such within a week of being back in my own environment but this time I did not. I wonder....well, I didn't have as much stress knocking my immune system down to germ take over levels maybe. Either way, I like it and I am a gonna keep it!

 Poll results: this one beats all others,5,"I actually conducted an informal POLL of people's opinions of the best instant coffee over on Recipezaar's ""Community"" chat forum and 8 out of 10 cooks there opted for this one! There were many respondents, 30 or 40, to my poll. I, too, was of that same opinion, having tasted every major instant coffee available. ""Taster's Choice"" brand was a way-back second place winner. It IS good coffee but it's usually the most expensive brand at the average grocery store. This is one of the few products which is not only the best in quality, it's also nearly the cheapest. I buy mine at The Family Dollar Store chain -- they always have it. The seven-ounce size fits nicely in one's cabinet and last a pretty good while, (I'm the only coffee drinker in my home, 1-2 cups per day). This is usually the size that I buy. If you haven't tried instant coffee in awhile, you should give it a go because it has improved 100% over the years. The key is to make sure that your water is actually BOILING as it is poured into a pre-warmed cup, (just run hot tap water over it for a few seconds). Also, experiment with the amount of coffee that you use. I use one ""slightly heaping"" teaspoon, (which is a very inexact measure), but you will soon determine how strong or weak you like it. Another tip, treat WATER as an INGREDIENT in any form of cooking! Don't boil plain tap water for your instant coffee -- use pure ""spring (bottled) water"". Read bottled water labels closely to assure that you're not just buying ""purified"" water, which usually originates from some polluted river source, (municipal water treatment), and which is a huge bottled water ripoff and a very widespread problem! If you want to go to the ultimate extreme for excellence and you drink your coffee with cream, then use REAL CREAM. It will keep much longer in your refrigerator these days because the producers are now using a process called ""ultra-pasteurization"" for most brands. Reach into the very back of the cooler at the grocery store and get a good ""sell by"" date on your dairy products when you buy them. The best dates are always in the back of the inventory because grocers rotate their stock that way. For sweetener, I often use ""Pure Organic Tupelo Honey"" which is twice as good as common clover honey. It can be obtained online from apiaries in the Florida panhandle. Nescafe is a superior product and a superb bargain and I give it my highest recommendation. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful
