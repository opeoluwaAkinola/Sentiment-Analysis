 Gluten-Free Bandwagon,1,"I totally agree with those expressing their requests for more ingredient information. There are so many gluten-free products on the market now because it's ""popular"" to do so and bucks can be made. I recently opened a wheat-free, gluten-free bakery because most commercial products take short-cuts and include ingredients which should not be combined, even if they are wheat-free & gluten-free. Also, most commercial gluten-free products contain a ton of sugar. Please be very selective and pay attention to how your body responds - you can learn to do that even before you eat something. …",5 out of 38 users found this review helpful

 As close to the Original Version as We've Seen Yet,4,"After rallying against the Cafe Francais in the beige can (that was too salty & sweet) - I found this new one - in a red, white and violet tin at a Walmart. I have saved one old tin of most versions so here's the run down Earliest original recipe: ""General Foods International Cafe Francais: French Style Flavored Instant Coffee"" has the universal 60 cal. per serving plus Total fat 3.5g , Saturated Fat 1 g, Sodium 95mg, Total Carb 7g, Sugars 4g - that one is from YEARS ago. Ingredients: non dairy creamer, sugar, instant coffee, sodium citrate, less than 2% artificial and natural flavor. No mention of Maxwell House on the front label. 8 oz. Recent tin before they really ruined things and it was still in a red white and blue tin: ""General Foods International Cafe Francais: Coffee Drink Mix"" Total fat 3g , Saturated Fat 2.5g, Trans Fat 0, Sodium 90mg, Total Carb 8g, Sugars 5g. Ingredients: non dairy creamer, sugar, instant coffee, MALTODEXTRIN, sodium citrate, less than 2% artificial and natural flavor. 8 oz. Yucky beige tin called ""Maxwell International Cafe: Cafe Francais: Cafe-Style Bevarage Mix"": Total fat 2.5g , Saturated Fat 2.5g, Trans Fat 0, Sodium 95mg, Total Carb 8g, Sugars 6g. Ingredients: non dairy creamer, sugar, instant coffee, sodium citrate, less than 2% artificial and natural flavor, ARTIFICIAL COLOR, SILICON DIOXIDE. 8 oz Newest red, violet & white tin, pictured here is called: ""General Foods International from the makers of Maxwell House: Cafe Francais: Coffee House Bevarage Mix"": Total fat 3g , Saturated Fat 2.5g, Trans Fat 0, Sodium 90mg, Total Carb 8g, Sugars 5g. Ingredients: non dairy creamer, sugar, instant coffee, MALTODEXTRIN, sodium citrate, less than 2% artificial and natural flavor, ARTIFICIAL COLOR, SILICON DIOXIDE. 7.6 oz! For some reason this new flavor is not as sharp/non sweet as the original recipe but I accept it and suspect that it's the closest we are going to get to our much loved original recipe. I hope that we go back to the very first original recipe with the least saturated fat. That one tasted the best!! Buy this one for now and let's petition GFI/Maxwell house to go way back to the original!! I hope this info helps you! …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Deceptive labeling for glorified peanut bars,1,"I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description. It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond, walnut and macadamia, especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list. Maybe they think that people can't tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts? I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK, but I have a hard time believing that the 4.5 star rating the product currently receives hasn't been created by company shills. It is a shame too, since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description. If I had only ordered these I likely would never have purchased another product from KIND PLUS. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 My personal fave,5,"My husband gave me a Keurig coffee maker, so we've been trying different flavors of coffee. To me, I don't care about brand necessarily, I just like flavored coffee. On the top of my list are Gloria Jean's assorted flavors (Hazelnut, French Vanilla, White Chocolate -- I think). That one also includes a Mudslide flavor, but we thought it had a slight coconut taste we didn't care for. I like the Kahlua brand Kahlua coffee, but the flavor portion is a little strong. But my VERY, VERY, VERY favorite flavor is this Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle flavor. It's just the right balance of ""coffee"" to ""flavor"" ratio. You can taste it, but still taste the coffee. And my kitchen smells heavenly! But a lot of it boils down to personal taste and preferences. If you typically like this type of flavored coffee, you will love this flavor. And I definitely recommend Subscribe and Save for K-cups if you have a Keurig. It's the most economical way to get them. You get a discount and free shipping. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Wonderful!!!,5,"Since we started using the Keurig coffee machine, we have tried all of the coffee on the market including making our own mixture. We are coffee drinkers. We have in our home a professional cappuccino machine, I mean the huge one you would find in a coffee shop or Italian cafe'.

 Worst Earl Grey I've Had,1,"This is the worst Earl Grey tea I've ever had. Bar none. The tea is so incredibly weak it is indistinguishable from normal black tea. I kid you not. I often looked at the box and the bags trying to determine if some mistake in packaging was made. The insert says ""mild flavor"" and they really do mean it. So mild you cannot taste the bergamot oil at all! I ended up using these as black tea filler in my iced tea mix, but I will never buy a Dilmah product again after being ripped off by this substandard tea. I can recommend Bigelow Earl Grey for economy minded folk. Just one of those tea bags has more flavor than an entire box of Dilmah's wretched excuse for an Earl Grey. …",7 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 It's hard to strike a balance with this flavor,3,"I've read a lot recently on how bad artificial sweeteners are for our health, so I decided to give this chocolate flavored liquid stevia a try. I simply cannot drink my coffee black, I was adding Hershey's sugar-free chocolate syrup and skim milk to my morning coffee. This stevia is a good substitute, but it's a flavor/sweetener I will have to learn to love. So far, not loving it, but it's better for me so I will buck up and maybe change my star rating later. I am experimenting at the moment, starting out with 5 drops per 8 ounces of coffee, it's sweet enough, but not enough chocolate flavor. Upping it to 8 drops per cup, it's starting to get there with the chocolate flavor, but it's too sweet. The Sweetleaf is all natural, has no calories, and is also rated 0 (zero) on the glycemic index. Also, you may think the price of this is expensive initially, but one 2 ounce bottle has around 300 servings, so it's cheaper for me considering the price of the Hershey's sugar-free syrup. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Good for gluten-free pizza,5,"Red Mill Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour, 44-Ounce Units (Pack of 4) This flour finally restored the basic right to eat pizza in my gluten-free household. Whisk together one cup of warm water (90-100 degrees F), 1 teaspoon of yeast, 1 1/2 cups of this flour and a dollop of olive oil. Turn your oven on for a few minutes, pour the batter into an oiled skillet and let it rise in the warmed oven for an hour. Bake just the crust at 375 for 10 minutes. Then spread the cheese or other toppings on the crust and return to the oven until the cheese is bubbly and browning. Serve the pizza and pass the tomato sauce!

 Very very tasty snack,5,"Attracted by the packaging, I purchased a bag [of the Classic Sea Salt flavor] in a local 'gourmet market'. At 110 calories, I suspected that I had been, as frequently happens, fooled by the 'serving size' (you know how it goes, 2.5 pieces = a 'serving' - so there are actually 7 'servings'/bag) BUT, NO, what a pleasant surprise - 110 calories was for the WHOLE delicious bag! They're non-greasy, light as a feather and unexpectedly filling - I almost couldn't finish the bag. I noticed they were produced here in NY, which I also liked and, after going online to find out more about them, decided to splurge for a case [of 1 oz. bags] to try all the varieties. One ounce doesn't sound like very much but they are so light that it is actually a very full bag and definitely more than enough for a single serving. (The 3 oz. bag contains substantially more then you would want for just one person) Favorites so far are: Honey Mustard & Onion Vintage Cheese Classic Sea Salt I don't have kids but I expect these would work extremely well as a lunch box addition. My only suggestion to the company would be that it might be a good idea if they made them available for purchase in smaller quantities. I'm afraid many people will be put off by having to purchase in 12- & 24-bag sized cases. But, if you do decide to purchase, I also have no doubt that you'll have no trouble sharing them with friends and will probably be back for more sooner than you expected. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful

I guess there are some limits you get from staying healthy. As a health snack I'd give them 5 stars though. Secondly, they leave almost no oil residue in your mouth. So you don't have to wash them down with any strong soda to cut the film off of your tongue. And let's face it, a healthy snack is not healthy if you have to use some unhealthy drink to wash it down. All in all, these are one of my favorite healthy snacks. Very good. …",17 out of 20 users found this review helpful
" and in not-so-blind taste testing, our consumer picked....",4,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:39 Mins </span>(* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Superstore) I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are Certified Organic Catnip , in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag . Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act ""stoned"" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige. As as far which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things - The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for ""marinating"" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea. The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a ""harmless, euphoric state"" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat. With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner..... When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil. Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten. …",34 out of 35 users found this review helpful

 Ajinomoto Hon Dashi,5,"I buy this locally in a much larger box but it is the same product. This product is just as good as making your own, which I did for years before finding it. The larger box has 1,000 servings but that is for a weak dashi so I use double the granules. For this product with the 3 packets, just add them into a small jar and use 1 ts per cup hot water (adjust to your tastes). That adjustment is why it says '3 to 6 cups'. Also, this product stores with no loss in flavor in a sealed container for years. I actually have some in a salt shaker (with rice to keep it dry) and use it commonly as a flavor boost to vegetables (green ones especially work well with it). This is actually a good starter size box. For those not sure what to do with it, a sample recipe: 3 cups made up dashi (1 packet)- taste and add water if you wish it weaker. 1 packet Udon noodles (may use cooked spagetti) appx 1.25 cups volume 1 cup lightly packed leafy vegetables (spinach, mustard greens, cabbages etc) Optional- baby bok choys whole, shellfish (whole or chopped), peeled shrimp, miso Bring to a simmer and as soon as the veggies and optional meats are done to your liking, it's ready.

 bad beef,2,I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product.

 VERY POPULAR IN OUR HOUSEHOLD AND VERY FRESH!,5,"I research before I buy anything, and I mean anything. I am picky and on a tight budget. I appreciate others reviews as that helps me in making decisions. I know pretty much what I am getting with few exceptions. Thanks to all of those who take time to give reviews. I was a little hesitant to buy candy online without pinching them to see if fresh but all turned out well. They are fresh and delivered right to our door in two days with prime shipping. The price was right too. Will order more as this order is going fast. My 84 year old mother loves her candy! Superstore and their Prime shipping has been such a blessing to us in our situation so I want to let everyone know about it that it might benefit. If you order almost everything online, like we do, Prime shipping pays for itself many times over in a year. No, Superstore did not pay me to say that, in fact, I am sure they lose money on shipping to us! Just don't know what we would have done without it.

 1 gram of trans-fat per 16 grams of cookie!,1,"As of Nov 2007, the Keebler website says that each 16 gram serving contains 1 gram of trans fat! Don't take my word for it that this is terrible, because here are some quotations from the survey article Mozaffarian et al ""Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,"" The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354, pages 1601-1613 (2006). Here are a few quotations from this article: ""given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD [""coronary heart disease""] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. ""heart attacks""] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted."" Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet: ""The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed."" They conclude ""On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm."" Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook ""nutritional epidemiology"", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book ""Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."" …",3 out of 21 users found this review helpful

To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote: Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. ""Okay,"" I begin ""but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth."" My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt! Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. ""Alright,"" they said ""This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow."" Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth. It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg! Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful.

 You're better off buying or making different icing,1,"This product isn't that impressive as far as taste goes. Yes, it'll do what you need it to do for drop flowers, shells, rosettes, etc. But you could just as easily buy meringue powder (dried egg whites) at the supermarket and add it to a regular can of store icing or even homemade buttercream for a much better taste. If taking a Wilton coure, they try to sell you their entire catalog of products, which would explain why this is recommended for the class. It tastes like Crisco-y vanilla. I'd be embarrassed to use this on a cake or cupcakes that I am serving to people. It's really not a pleasant taste. If you do want to buy this for a Wilton course or another reason, buy it at Michaels, AC Moore, or a local baking supply store. I love Superstore--really, I do.

 $ 1 4 . 0 0 .....A.....G A L L O N....?,1,"WITH SHIPPING, (AND HANDLING!), THE COST OF THIS ARROWHEAD DISTILLED WATER COMES TO $14.005 PER GALLON! This price is even hard for luxury-loving me to swallow! Especially as there is a way to make distilled water, (even without a water-distiller!) for just about no cost at all! Please note that I am NOT here singling out Arrowhead Distilled water as being over-priced. It just happened to come up first on the list of ready-made distilled water, here at Superstore. I'm sure that it, (and all the other ready-made distilled waters being sold), is tasty and healthy, (and convenient!) distilled water. However, it is WOEFULLY OVER-PRICED. My review here is for ALL ready-to-drink, distilled waters, offered on Superstore, (and elsewhere), at such ridiculous prices. HOW can one make distilled water far more cheaply -- and without a water-distiller? By employing a method known as ""home-distillation"". (This has NOTHING whatsoever to do with home distillation of whisky, of course. It is for home-distillation of WATER. Nothing illegal here, (yet, anyway!) Copper kettles, copper coils, and new-made cornmash are NOT required, or used here! What IS used? Large, (gallon size, if possible), glass jars. The type in which organic apple juice often is seen. What to do: After washing out the bottle thoroughly, (and or, after previously drinking up all of the delicious organic apple juice), rinse jar throughly, to be sure no soap is left in the jar. Rinse first with hot water, then, very slowly, (so as not to have an abrupt temperature change that can crack the glass), decrease the amount of hot water, and increase the amount of cold water used to rinse out the jar. When 100% cold water is flowing from the faucet into the jar, keep rinsing jar for another minute. Finally, empty the jar, and fill with 100% cold(est) water. Lightly cover with a PLASTIC cap, as metal caps tend to get rusty after a while. (I find that different top colours from gallon-sized jugs of milk are perfect for this: gradually build up a collection of red, orange, green, white, and other colour milk-gallon tops, from whole, nonfat, and other types of milk. Caps from bottles of products such as ENSURE, and PEDIA-SURE, are also good for lightly covering these gallon milk containers, filled now as they are with home-distilled-water-in-the-making.) Fill up as many of these empty gallon glass containers as you can, (and for which you have room on your kitchen counter, or elsewhere), waiting at least an hour before you fill each jug in sequence, using a different colour top for each one. Get some magnets, and place them in a handy place -- like on your refrigerator door. Take some small pieces of paper, and write the colour of each top/cover, on them. Attach the pieces of paper to your refrigerator door, (or other handy place). Line the pieces of paper up in a row, with the colour of the cover of the first jug you fill first, the colour of the colour of the top of the second jug you fill second, and so on. Now, just wait at least 10 hours from the time you fill the first jug. When you want some distilled water, simply pour it into the saucepan / goldfish bowl, or wherever else you want to use your home-distilled water. DO NOT USE MORE THAN HALF OF THE CONTENTS OF EACH JAR! The secret of home-distilled water, you see, is that all of the flouride, and other things that are put into tap water, that you do not want, (and are the reason you buy or make distilled water in the first place), will, during the 10 or more hours you are waiting, sink down to the bottom of the bottle, as they are heavier than the water! I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU BOIL THE WATER IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU HAVE DISTILLED IT, HOWEVER -- AT LEAST TWO FULL MINUTES ON A FULL BOIL. BECAUSE ""STANDING WATER"" CAN GET STALE, (AND PROBABLY DANGEROUS), IF YOU LEAVE IT OUT TOO LONG WITHOUT REFRIGERATION.) Of course, if you have a HUGE refrigerator, you can probably put the distilled water into it immediately after filling the jugs, and reduce, or eliminate, the boiling time otherwise required. If you must boil the water, and want COOL distilled water, just turn the gas or electric stove off after the required two minutes, and wait until the water has cooled. When you finish using the first bottle of distilled water, rinse it out again with hot, then ever-so-slowly, cooler -- then cold water. Move the paper attached to the refrigerator with the magnet, signifying the first bottle, (say, with the word ""blue"" on the paper -- signifying that the first bottle has a blue cap on it), to the end of the row. Now, take the paper attached by a magnet signifying the second bottle, (say, with the word ""yellow"" written on it, meaning the yellow-capped bottle), to the ""head of the line"" of pieces of paper attached by magnets, on your refrigerator. And so on. This way, you need only move the papers attached by magnets, on your refrigerator, and not the bottles themselves, to always know which bottle has been sitting out the longest, (and hence has the most distillation at the moment.) Lifting these little papers-attached-by-magnets-to-the-refrigerator, and moving them around, to different places in the line on your refrigerator, is a whole lot easier than always lifting, and repositioning the gallon-size glass jars on your kitchen counter! In any event, you will now have pure, home-distilled water! The longer you let the water remain in the jugs, the more distilled the water will be. The less you take out of each jug, the more distilled the water will be. NOTE: DISTILLING WATER, BY ANY METHOD, WILL ALSO ELIMINATE NEEDED MINERALS FROM THE WATER. Because minerals -- along with flouride and other contaminates your well-meaning city water system puts into city water -- are also heavier than the water. SO, IF YOU DRINK DISTILLED WATER, FROM ANY SOURCE, BE SURE TO ALSO TAKE MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS! This SOUNDS like a very, very complicated process -- but read it a few times, and you will see how actually very, very simple it is. You get another bonus when boiling the distilled water -- it takes LESS TIME TO BOIL, AND WILL BOIL MORE THROUGHLY, because the floride, minerals, and other things have been removed from the water. It's like the difference between boiling water that has pebbles in it, and water that doesn't have pebbles in it. Because these ""extra-aqualar"" particles -- minerals, flouride, etc. -- are just that: tiny, microscopic ""pebbles"". Line up as many gallon jugs as you can find and have room for, (I have 8). Have fun and save money with your home-distilled water. It will cost ONLY the price of your water-bill! …",5 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Mild sweet tea,5,I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose. Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth. I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea. Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening. …,24 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Savory Gravy Enhancer,5,"If you love buying rotisserie chicken you can layer slices of chicken on fresh bread, then dip the sandwiches in a delicious homemade chicken gravy. The flavor of the gravy can be greatly enhanced by using this stock base. This chicken base also contains turmeric and soy protein. Better Than Bouillon is a stock paste or more like a chicken base than a bouillon cube. Dry bouillon cubes are famous for being overly salty and that is why chicken base is a much healthier, not to mention, tasty alternative. One teaspoon of bouillon blended into one cup of hot water makes one cup of chicken stock. I use two tablespoons butter and two tablespoons flour plus the stock and a sprinkling of poultry seasoning, freshly ground pepper and paprika. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, whisk in the flour and then the stock. The stock base is also perfect when you are making soups and one to two tablespoons is enough to flavor an entire pot of stock. You can also put the leftover rotisserie chicken in a stockpot, cover with water and simmer with vegetables and herbs/spices to make a delicious homemade stock. I love enhancing the stock with Better Than Bouillon and the possibilities are endless after you learn to make chicken stock and then use this product to enhance the flavor. ~The Rebecca Review …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 A versatile starting point -- here's how to boost the flavor and nutrition,5,"What's great about this mix? 1) Super easy, 2) Great, moist texture even when you change the recipe, and 3) Really good value, especially on Subscribe and Save. It's got a healthful set of ingredients -- whole wheat flour, molasses, brown sugar, baking soda, and spices. The large amount of molasses is unusual for a mix, and it adds rich flavor and lots of magnesium, calcium, potassium and iron. The whole grain adds nutrition and fiber. And best of all, it mixes easily, bakes up perfectly every time (I've made about 15 batches so far), and my 5-year-old loves it. It's great as an after-school snack; it satisfies his sweet tooth without feeding him junk. The one fault this mix has, IMO, is that it's a little bland. For some, that's perfect. But for me, it's a challenge -- what can I do to pump up the flavor? Here are some of the ""hacks"" I use to make my gingerbread tastier: I grate a hefty amount of fresh ginger into the mix, and/or add a heaping teaspoon of powdered ginger and/or cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Orange zest also adds to the flavor. And I frequently substitute orange juice or carrot juice, or a mix, for the 1-1/2 cups of milk that's called for in the recipe. I mash two ripe bananas, put them into a measuring cup, add fresh grated nutmeg and fresh ginger, and add milk or carrot juice to make 1-1/2 cups of wet ingredients to substitute for the milk. Wow, you wouldn't believe how great banana gingerbread smells and tastes, and the texture is so moist and tender. The Hodgson Mill site also taught me a great hack -- substitute a 15-oz can of pumpkin and 3/4 cup orange juice for the milk and fat. You can add nuts, grated carrots, craisins, pretty much whatever you want, and this extremely reliable mix always turns out well. Pretty much any flavor or food that works with ginger and molasses can be added to this bread with good results, as long as you don't change the dry/wet ratio. I highly recommend this mix either as an enjoyable, if mild, snack, or as a base for your own expansions and explorations. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Sumptiously delicious!,5,"I have searched high and low to find a high-quality sugar free, dairy free chocolate bar that tasted just like the real thing, and I can honestly say that these amazing chocolate bars fit the bill perfectly! Ross Chocolates has truly done it--I could not tell the difference between these and the kind made with sugar and dairy. These dark chocolate bars are perfect for anyone looking for a pure, healthy alternative to the standard sugar-laden chocolate bar out there. I am hypoglycemic, so normal sugary candy isn't an option for me. These bars, though, have no impact on my blood sugar--in fact, I feel even better after eating them and have no negative reactions whatsoever! They are also perfect for people who are allergic to dairy (like myself) because they are completely dairy-free. As an added bonus, each bar contains 3 grams of fiber! The bars have a wonderul, fresh crunch to them, with none of the strange aftertaste common to some products sweetened with sugar alcohols.

 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",38 out of 40 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",33 out of 48 users found this review helpful
 Multi Cat Family - All Of Them Love Newman's Own Pet Food,5,"We switched to Newman's Own dry and wet food several years ago. We have noticed a huge difference in our pets. Yes, we have cats and dogs all who are rescues. Because of their early history, many have health issues. Since switching them to Newman's Own most have leveled out and we spend less time at the Vet. The food cost less in the long run, because of better health for your animals. We also noticed that all of our animals love this product. Some of them like the dry better than the wet and vis-versa.

 Meh,3,"We got the twenty-four-piece multi-pack, which comes with four flavors: Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, Strawberry, and Sour Apple. The ingredients for the Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, and Strawberry are: ""organic apple puree, organic apple juice concentrate, organic flavor, pectin, colored with fruit and vegetable juice."" Also, some vitamins and minerals are added. Sour Apple ingredients are exactly the same, except there is no coloring added. The ""organic flavor"" ingredients are not specified, nor are the fruit and vegetable juices used for color. We can assume that these ingredients do vary among the different flavored fruit ropes, but we don't know what they are. These fruit ropes do not have the fruit taste we thought they should. Our family didn't like them very much. They aren't terrible -- we just don't think they're good enough to purchase again; but maybe that's just because we're accustomed to natural foods. The ingredients aren't bad either, but they're nothing exciting -- as far as we can tell, they're just apple (pectin comes from apples) with anonymous color and flavor enhancers (and the supplemental vitamins and minerals). Additionally, among the Tropical Twist flavored fruit ropes were several that had not been packaged properly. The ropes were sticking out the bottoms of the wrappers, having been squished along with the wrapper when the machinery pressure/heat sealed them. The reviewers who thought these were very chewy must have gotten stale ones. The fresh ones are on the softer side, but still sticky. (Braces wearers, beware.) For small, individually-wrapped dried fruit treats, I would recommend Stretch Island fruit leather instead. These contain the fruits named in their flavors (e.g. the ingredients in Stretch Island's ""orchard cherry"" fruit leather are: apple puree concentrate, cherry puree concentrate, orange puree concentrate, natural black cherry flavor) and they taste like those fruits, too, without being too sweet or tart or sticky. …",31 out of 36 users found this review helpful

 Another Good Choice in Organic Cookies,4,"After my positive experience with Valley Cookie Cremes, Double Chocolate , Own Organics Newman-O'S Ginger-O's, 16-Ounce Packages , and the Own Organics Alphabet Cookies, Cinnamon, 10-Ounce Bags , I thought I would give Country Choice a go. So far, I'm ""4-for-4"" in ordering good organic cookies. I took a chance and bought them without trying them first. I'm happy to say I was not disappointed. Country Choice Organic Ginger Lemon is a good tasting cookie that have all the benefits of sweetness we would expect from cookies, but lacking the artificial ingredients consistent with cookies commonly on the market. The cookies are lighter than other organic cookies I've tried, but the taste is quite strong and the cookies are sweet, a surprise from my initial introduction to organic cookies that had the flavor and consistency of the cardboard box they were stored in. There are some points the consumer needs to know; they may be minuses for some, but they're certainly pluses for me: 1) The cookies are VERY sweet; I had to have a glass of milk with them. While I adore sweet cookies, it may turn some people off. Be mindful of that. 2) The taste of ginger is overwhelmed by the strongest taste of lemon in cookies I've ever had. To me this would be a significant minus, except that I absolutely love the lemony taste in cookies. The aroma is heavenly, but the taste is so powerful it seems almost artificial. Oddly, I can taste a hint of ginger when they're dunked in milk (any explanation from food chemists/scientists out there?). Again I love that taste, but others may not. If you want the gingery taste, you would have to be an expert food taster to find it here (in my opinion). 3) While these cookies are made with organic and natural ingredients (no hydrogenated oils or trans fats), they're still cookies: they are loaded with sugar, sodium and carbs. Two cookies pack a whopping 130 calories; 50 calories from fat. Remember, organic does not always mean healthy. And because these cookies are lighter than other organic cookies I've tried, and very tasty, it is very easy to overeat them. 4) These cookies (barely) pass my all-important ""dunkability"" test, where they adequately absorb milk to compliment the flavor of the cookies (Oreo's, despite their artificial ingredients, is still king in the dunkability of cookies, in my honest opinion). They taste delicious when dunked, but these cookies begin to fall apart quickly, so holding them under milk for a length of time could be problematic. Given the minuses I've indicated, you wonder: why do I give it four stars. Simple: I love them. Taste, like beauty, is in the eye (or palate) of the beholder. And I can't get enough of them. While my opinion is unquestionably biased, I try to give as much unbiased information on the product as I can. Use it to make your decision. As with all Superstore grocery products, I recommend going to a supermarket or specialty store (Whole Foods, for example), buy a single pack and sample the cookies before you buy the entire case. I took a gamble and bought the case untested; it's a gamble that has paid dividends for me. …",16 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Mild sweet tea,5,I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose. Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth. I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea. Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening. …,24 out of 26 users found this review helpful
" Good taste, great nutrient density",4,"Product: ""Amazing Grass Green Superfood"" (unflavored) STRONG LIKES: * Nutritional Density: This product contains a well balanced organic mix of nutritionally super-dense dehydrated grass & vegetable extracts (wheat grass, barley grass, alfalfa, ""spirulina"" blue-green algae, spinach and broccoli), natural plant-based antioxidants (Acai berry, maca, carrot, beet, raspberry, rose hips, pineapple, green tea and acerola cherry), fiber (ground flax seed, and apple pectin), enzymes & pre/probiotics (chicory root, acidophilous, amylase, protease, lipase, lactase, cellulase), and mild herbal stimulants (peppermint and eleuthero root). * Pleasant Taste: For the unflavored powder (the only version I've tried as of this writing), the texture is very slightly gritty (as you'd expect from dehydrated plant extracts and ground flax), but the flavor is pleasant and pairs well with other flavors ... the finish is faintly sweet, with a vague hint of raspberry and cocoa powder. MINOR NITS: * Premium Price: This is a somewhat expensive product, but don't let that deter you because it's very good value, given it's quality and high nutritional density. On a serving for serving basis, it's still cheaper than a shot of freshly squeezed wheat grass at your local healthfood market - and it's more balanced too. Prices should begin to slowly decrease as other companies jump onboard with wheat grass and spirulina production, and you can always use a bit less than the recommended serving size (especially if you're mixing it with other supplements). * Mixability: I'd classify it as ""ok"" on mixibility. Stirring doesn't work well, so I've found it best to either use a drink blender, or scoop a little into a small reusable jar (along with any other nutritional powders you like), and shake it with your liquid of choice (I use fat free milk). * Nomenclature: The claim of ""amazing energy"" is slightly misleading, because this is NOT an energy drink - it contains only a small amount of carbohydrate. What it DOES contain are B-vitamins and pre/pro-biotic ingredients that indirectly help your metabolism. This is not a complaint per se, but rather an attempt to help clarify the claim on the label. BOTTOM LINE: * Highly recommended - a good and fully organic supplement for busy people on the run. I'd have given it 5 stars if it blended a little better and was a bit more economical, but regardless I'm very happy with it, and will continue to buy it regularly. You don't have to be a vegan to enjoy it. …",100 out of 100 users found this review helpful
 Outstanding product,5,"Fast and easy, and great flavor. About as close as you are getting without making them from scratch. My wife sadly is addicted to refried beans from a can. If you can't tolerate refried beans that look like jellied cranberry sauce and smell like a bad cross between dogfood and other unknown substances (let alone taste ugh!), then this product is for you! Ingredients are very simple, it's just that these are pre prepared and dehydrated. Very lightweight, so if you are going outdoors, these are great to pack and rehydrate, and will definitely help keep you warm in the sleeping bag later, and the packaging is lightweight, so easy to dispose of after. On top of that, there's normal beans in this pack as well, very yummy also. Packaging wise, they come in a 2 part box, dispose of the top and you have a bottom display like container to keep them well organized. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" 16 oz is a huge amount, the picture is decieving, bigger than a soda can",5,"I got sick of buying Mexican vanilla that wasn't real vanilla, and the blue cattle co. vanilla that just tasted watered down, so you had to use double or triple quantities in everything to get the right taste. If you didn't know, Mexico does not have label standards, or an FDA, and people can sell that non-conforming vanilla online because online purchases are not regulated since they can be cross boarder. It is a classic case of federal government not being able to respond fast enough in a globalizing food market and technology. Coumarin is a toxic substance found in Mexican vanilla (even if it is labeled ""organic"") that can cause irreversible liver damage from studies I read. I have decided that true madagascar burbon vanilla is the only way to go, and this McCormicks is the best price I've found on that variety of vanilla bean extract. I cannot tell the difference between other more expensive madagascar burbon brands such as spice islands, and safeways O-organics label. McCormicks has a reputation to maintain, they can't afford expensive lawsuits, and it is of course passed through standard American FDA standards, which basically protects the consumer from some of the stuff Mexico makes. The following is an excerpt you can find by googling ""Mexican vanilla danger"" 2008 FRIDAY, Oct. 31 (HealthDay News) -- So-called Mexican ""vanilla"" is often made with a toxic substance called coumarin and shouldn't be bought by consumers, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned this week. Coumarin is related to warfarin, which is found in some blood thinners. Eating foods with coumarin may be dangerous for people taking blood thinners, because the combination could increase their risk of bleeding. Mexican vanilla -- which may smell and taste like real vanilla and is cheaper than the real thing -- is sold in Mexico and other Latin American countries and has started appearing in some U.S. stores and restaurants, the FDA said. Pure vanilla is made with the extract of beans from the vanilla plant. Mexican vanilla is frequently made with the extract of beans from the tonka tree, an entirely different plant that belongs to the pea family. Tonka bean extract contains coumarin. Since 1954, coumarin has been banned from all food products sold in the United States. Consumers should be cautious when buying vanilla in Mexico and other Latin American countries, the FDA advised. Look for ""vanilla bean"" on the label's ingredient list. Don't buy the product if it says ""tonka bean"" or has a vague ingredient list or no list. …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Bad  Tooth Tartar: all but gone,5,"I have a Rescue Weiner dog with teeth that had very bad tartar from front to back. Simply said, they were total brown. The vet suggested scraping which costs about $90.00. She sold me the large size (bag of 15 each) for about $18.00. Foxie the Weiner dog loves them. I also gave her Cow knees fron the butcher shop. (You can bake the knees to get rid of the grease and rancid smell.)The combination of the two has cleaned the dogs teeth remarkably in about thirty + days. She no longer needs to have her teeth scraped. I searched many internet sources for these products. With the $25.00 minimum Superstore supersaver shiping I saved about 45% off of the vet's cost and about 20% to 30% from many online vendor's.I saved $ by buying the large size, then cut them in half with a sharp knife or poultry shears.To keep you dog from vomiting the chew, use the large or extra large size.

" Great System, but not inexpensive",4,"I have two cats (male, 12 pounds & female, 7 pounds) and just switched from the Scoop Free (because I had to scoop constantly due to my cat's litter habits) to the Breeze. I love the Breeze because it is very easy, low maintenance, and has excellent odor control. The only negative is the maintenance cost, but I figured out the usage for my household and it's virtually the same cost as the Scoop Free system. It is not an economical system compared to scoopable litter, clay litter, or all natural litter alternatives. You are paying for convenience and the neatness. It's really mess-free and I never have to touch the pad, just dump the tray into the trash. I'm confused by some of the poor reviews because it really is a simple system. Honestly, you'd have to be really drunk or half brain dead to screw it up. It has to be used as a complete system. It doesn't work if you try to not use the pads or take some other random cost-cutting measure. I cannot figure out how the urine pan could leak at all if you are using the pad (right side up with the green plastic side down and the absorbant white side up) and you are changing it when it becomes full. It functions like a diaper, once the absorbancy has been exhausted, that's it. You get longer life/better absorbancy if you rotate the tray since cats tend to pee in the same area of the box every time. If you have multiple cats and one box, or a large cat that pees a lot, you may need to change your pad more often, but that's specific to your cat. If you are using the box properly with any amount of common sense applied, it will not leak. The bag of pellets is sparse, but that's because it is just supposed to let the urine pass through and give your cat a comfortable environment to allow burying. The pellets are not meant to absorb the urine, or stick to the poop. They do recommend that you completely change the pellets every month, so you don't really want to put in more than you need for your cat's comfort. Both my cats are quite content with one pack. There is no tracking with these pellets, I rarely find more than two or three pellets on the floor near the box. I do not find that the pellets remove any odor from the solid waste. I do notice an odor right after my cat has a bowel movement, or if the box is left longer than day without scooping out the solid waste. I scoop daily into a litter locker and have no odor in the general areas of the box (unless there is something very fresh). My pads last a full week, I do have to rotate them once. I have never smelt urine from this box. I do want to point out that because we have two cats and three levels of the house we did add additional boxes per the mfg recommendation (which I thought was crazy initially), however, it really did improve my cats' litter habits. One cat was using alternative (and undesirable) areas to relieve herself (like my suitcase, laundry basket, etc.) Once I put in multiple boxes, that behavior completely stopped. We have three boxes for the two cats, one at each level: basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor. The pads generally last at least a week for all boxes, occasionally one box will be used less and a pad will last two weeks. The pellets are still odor free after 6 weeks. I agree that the refill costs are high, but as I said, comparable with the ScoopFree system, but this was actually cleaner and easier given the unique habits of my cats. For me, the cost is worth the ease, convenience and general cleanliness of the system. …",52 out of 54 users found this review helpful
 Worth a Try.,5,"Our baby was born in early October. My wife wanted to feed him the way nature intended and we were visited by a lactation nurse at the hospital. She advised us and said that if we ever had problems with obtaining enough milk, we might try Fenugreek, a supplement available at health-food stores. Of course, we forgot the peculiar name shortly thereafter. Well, my wife started to have difficulties a few weeks later in keeping up with the baby's growing needs. We mentioned the problem to a young couple who had a recent child. The woman said she had the same problem and told us to get Fenugreek. She said it had worked for her. There was that strange-sounding word again. We purchased Nature's Way Fenugreek shortly thereafter. Strange stuff. It's an herbal supplement in capsule form, but the label doesn't say what it's for. I guess you just have to know. Evidently, it's one of those things that takes a certain amount of faith. Anyway, since we heard about it from two completely independent sources, my wife started taking it. Well, it wasn't a miracle. There was no immediate change. However, my wife gradually began to keep up with the baby's needs and has kept up ever since. Was it the Fenugreek? Perhaps. Maybe she was just adapting to the new baby. It's hard to tell. However, if anyone is having this problem, I'd say the Fenugreek is worth a try. Gary Peterson …",20 out of 22 users found this review helpful

" The naysayers overstate the 'problems', and the bottom line is, this stuff WORKS. No sugar, no crash. It's true.",5,"Alright folks, so I'm just gonna lay all my cards on the table, because that's what you're supposed to do in an honest review right? I'm terminally ill, and I mean REALLY sick. I'm fighting hard, but it's a rough time. Part of that includes loss of muscle control, which includes the bladder, etc... Sheesh! LOL I was watching a review one morning on Fox News, after having been using this stuff for awhile, where the doctor they had on just TORE the energy drink business apart. He talked about how dangerous all of them were, and untested and how they basically don't work... Well I'm here to tell you otherwise. I went and got the EXACT bottle of 5 Hour Energy, Extra Strength, that I always buy, and which he was talking about. He was going on and on about how it was loaded with caffeine and was therefore bad for your heart. PLEASE! I've got the bottle IN MY HANDS right now folks. It states right on it, and this is the extra strength mind you, that it contains caffeine comprable to 12 oz. cup of coffee. That's not much! And yes, he was right that most of them work by being LOADED with sugar to go with the caffeine, and come with a REALLY bad crash afterwards. I experimented with some of the other products, and they taste delicious, but come with an AWFUL crash. This stuff doesn't taste so great because it has NO SUGAR, but it's just a tiny shot, and it works dammit. And then the doctor told the audience that it stimulates the nerves, and has been shown to cause nerve damage. I literally did a spit take. I was HORRIFIED. But low and behold, I talked to my own team of FIVE Neurologists that work on my case, and they disagreed. They said that a lot of the other drinks are unhealthy, diet-wise. This stuff causes what is called a Niacin Flush, and most of the energetic affects are from megadoses of vitamins. My Neurologists said that this stuff wasn't going to be hurting me, and at worst just might not work. But it DOES WORK! As I mentioned, I'm very sick. And that includes days when I am so weak I can't get out of bed or my chair. When I'm having nerve spasms, and can't control my muscles, I will sometimes have accidents when I fall asleep. I know the feeling well enough now to know, without doubt, when it will happen. Come on folks, I just admitted something really personal, and you can't get much more down in the dirt than that. LOL So when I feel that feeling, but am also really tired, I will drink one of these. It will keep me up and focused, and most importantly accident free, for between 3 and 5 hours while my nerve medications can kick in. And as those of us who have these problems can attest, that peace of mind, that time that is bought for us, ANYTHING to not make us incontinent if we can help it, is worth a LOT. Certainly the price of these little gems. The drink wakes me up, and it does NOT give me the jitters or make me edgy. I do not feel overwhelmed or hyper. It simply gives me the energy to get through my rough patch without falling asleep and waking up in a mess. LOL If there is one downside to this, it's the price. But I ask you this... How many of us are Starbuck's or expensive coffee fanatics? I was for YEARS. And we buy those mostly to help us to stay alert and awake through our day, and also because they are delicious. LOL These cost, per bottle, less than a Venti coffee. And seriously, they work. And that's what they are advertised to do, and that's JUST what they do. And that's all I NEED them to do. Not every product out there does what it says it will do. So that's a boost in my book right off the bat. I thank you for your time folks. Give these a try if you were needing a safe and least minimally harmful boost to your day during the more tired moments that we ALL have. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Sincerely, R.A.

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",18 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 This milk really makes our baby really sick!! :(,1,"Sorry to give this 1 star. but this milk really makes our baby really sick!! :(, literally!! if your baby can take it, I guess it's a good one but for us, we had the worst experience with it. Here is our story. My baby had been solely breastfed. After 9 months my wife was running short of her milk. She didn't have enough breastmilk for the baby and he didn't take as much solid food as we would want him to. We gave him Similac Advance, it was recommended by the hospital. First Similac Advance Liquid, he threw up 9 times within 2 hours after half an hour of feeding. That happened twice. A few days later, we tried Similac Advance power, he threw up again! This time 5 times plus serious diarrhea for 5 days. He has lost 5% of his weight within 2 days. That's really bad. We were desperate. We took him to the hospital twice that week. The doctor though it was stomach flu. However, I didn't quit agree with him. What a coincident that 2 different formula milk feeding incidents would throw my baby off balance. I'm a computer engineer and dealing with solving and debugging problems all the time. I was firm with the doctor that this was not a coincident. I thought it might have something to do with the protein in the formula that my baby couldn't digest. We decided to try Lactose free formula (Nutramigen from Enflora). It smell and taste really awful (my wife tried it and she gagged. As we thought, my baby rejected to drink it. Then I tried Good Start soy. Same story, smell bad but not as bad as Nutromigen. My baby also rejected to drink it. Now we were really desperate, not enough milk for him and he doesn't like to eat solid food!! He would throw up + diarrhea if he gave him normal formula milk. Phone call to 4 advise nurses, no luck! I finally search on the internet and found a lot of similar story to what we experienced (including this on Superstore reviews). I decided to give it a final try, crossing our fingers really tight. Good Start Gentle Plus is our last hope or my baby would not have any more milk to drink. He's losing weight!! And then miracle happened!!! This milk works wonderfully for him. The only complain I would have is that it doesn't smell as good as the normal cow milk-based formula, however, doesn't smell or taste awful like the other two. My baby didn't quite used to the tasted in the beginning and didn't really want to drink it at first. So we tried mixed it with breastmilk for a few days. Now he is a happy baby, gaining weight, doesn't throw up and used to the taste of it. My wife and I are now happy again :) …",2 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 deelish AND good for you!,5,"I ordered this through Superstore because it was such a good bargain. I can't even find the muesli at any of my usual stores here in San Antonio, so I was excited to find Superstore could ship it out. I anticipated it would be a good product, and I was not disappointed. It's not overly sweet; the dates and raisins take care of any sugar cravings you might have, but they're not so sweet that you feel like you're getting a kids' breakfast cereal. Instead, what you get is a very nutty flavor enhanced by a delicate sort of sweetness. If you want more sweetness, I suggest you add a dollop of honey. That would just put this over the top. I guess you could also use some artificial sweetener, but I'd not do that. Why mess up a wonderful ""natural"" product with something artificial like aspartame or the like? Yuk. I love the addition of sunflower seeds and flax, and the oats are especially healthy choices for this mix. YOu can eat this hot or cold, with cold being my preferred mode, but I like the hot version, too. I make mine with evaporated skim milk, which allows for a richer milk flavor without any of the fat. It's a hearty breakfast food, but I think you could also use it for dinner on especially cold evenings when you want something that will ""stick to your ribs"" and be all-around healthy as well. Oats--good for your heart. Flax--ditto. Sunflower seeds--good source of protein, I think. Dates and raisins--can't go wrong there, but don't ask me to pinpoint a body part they particularly benefit. Heh. Let's see--lots of whole grains here, so you will get your servings of the stuff that will keep you healthy, happy, and ""reglar."" :-) I love that this is so healthy a food and that it also tastes great! I plan to order more Bob's Red Mill products as a result of my good experience with this product. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful
" Tasty!  It's Different, at least!",4,"what is it? I'm so confused! My sweet, adventuremonger husband, Norman, thought this was a hoot, so he bought it and cooked it up for me, for our 15 and a half year anniversary candlelight dinner. MMMmm, yummy. After a few dee-lish bites, I, of course, asked him, ""Sweetums, what IS this?"" ""Why, Snugglepuss, it's Turducken, of course!"" he answered, with a wicked grin. I kept eating, trying the different colors, white and dark meat, that sliced in a lovely way. ""Huh?"" I managed, with a mouthful of white meat. ""Tur - duck - hen,"" he pronounced patiently, slowly. as if speaking to a very slow thinker. Like, oh, now I get it! Not. Then, he kindly showed me the packaging, which he fished out of the trash. Ohh, but of course, a part Turkey, part Duck, and part Hen. why didn't I see it!? The hen, I assume is the part that's chicken. Well, I give the inventors a gold star for inventiveness! Who'd of thunk?? Being as I love it when my man cooks for me (and shops) I didn't complain. It was lovely. tender, moist, and certainly unusual. Pricy, perhaps. But, how often do you see a turducken? my Norman is a hunter, and he's never brought home anything like this!

 People are crazy,4,"I bought this from a local eatery on lunch today and it really isn't that bad. If you cannot get past the color difference, I wouldn't recommend buying it. There is a VERY SLIGHT metallic aftertaste - which one might expect if something has ""over 77 trace minerals and electrolytes"" in it and does not contain any additives to HIDE these things. One post said it was greasy or thick - that person wasn't drinking BLK. Maybe they poured themselves a cup of motor oil and are mistaken. Obviously, if allow your mind to play tricks on you, this item will not be very enjoyable as you will associate the color with other things of this color (ahem...motor oil). But, if you can get past the mental part of it - I think it's worth a shot. The price, however, is a bit outrageous. …",40 out of 50 users found this review helpful
 Not for everyone,2,"Haribo makes a wide range of candies, including some world class goodies, but this is not one of them. The frogs are made of a hard gummi, and are all green except for a thin white layer on the frogs' bellies. You might not recognize them as frogs unless you're told. There is no discernible taste or texture difference between the white and green substances, and in any case, the flavor is unidentified, unidentifiable, and not very good. It definitely is not lime, as advertised. Maybe somebody likes this stuff, but I didn't. I set the bag out at the office after my first sample. …",0 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 AMAZINGLY Deceptive,2,"Honestly, this is probably one of the best chocolate bars out there. As I'm sure most people agree they can eat this in one sitting much like any other candy bar out there and maybe most can it eat more than once a day. What's deceptive is the nutrition for it! What should be one serving is considered THREE servings. Each serving is 200 calories and 15g of fat. That means the whole package is 600 calories and 45g of fat! An average build person should only eat 60g of fat a day! So the amazingly great taste comes at a massive price and it's not worth it. …",2 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 The ingredients are not correct! Very upset!,1,"I ordered this gum from this same store before because they didn't sell spry with titanium dioxide in it. I read the ingredients again before I ordered this time and it still said ONLY ""Ingredients Xylitol, gum base, peppermint oil (natural flavor), vegetable glycerin (humectant), gum Arabic (texturizer), non-GMO soy lecithin (emulsifier) and beeswax (glazing agent)."" Yes I copied and pasted it here to show you all just in case it gets changed. I refuse gum or anything else that has titanium dioxide in it. Why you ask? Here you read for your self. ""Titanium dioxide has recently been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen ''possibly carcinogen to humans''."" [...] AND "" Titanium dioxide is an inorganic compound used in a range of body care products such as sunscreens and makeup. It appears to have low skin penetration but inhalation is a concern."" So I don't want to chew something that is bad if I breath it in. I am VERY upset over this discovery, being I give this gum to my kids. Now I have to find a Xylitol sweetened gum for my family, again. I have been chewing this gum for years and loved the ALL NATURAL ingredients, not anymore! By the way here is the ingredient list for the new bottle "" Ingredients Xylitol, gum base, peppermint oil (natural flavor), vegetable glycerin (humectant), gum Arabic (texturizer), non-GMO soy lecithin (emulsifier), titanium dioxide (natural coloring) & beeswax (glazing agent).

" Great Idea, BAD Marketing",2,"I read most of the reviews (especially the negative ones) about this product before purchasing and knew of the possibility that this particular model may not fit the brand of natural PB my wife likes (16 oz Natural Organic PB from Trader Joe's in a plastic jar). I decided to get it because there was a decent chance it would fit. Without opening the package, I could tell it wouldn't fit. This could have easily been avoided if the specs were included in the product details. Anyone purchasing this or similar models should know that there are 6 DIFFERENT MODELS TO CHOOSE FROM: #100 -- crank mixer for 16 oz jar with 77mm lid #200 -- twist **** mixer for 16 oz reduced fat jar with 77mm lid #300 -- crank mixer for 16 oz jar with 70mm lid #400 -- crank mixer for 26 oz jar with 83mm lid #500 -- twist **** mixer for 26 oz jar with 83mm lid #600 -- twist **** mixer for 36 oz jar with 99mm lid The product considered in this review refers to Model #100. Those of you who want it to fit on the Trader Joe's PB that I mentioned earlier will need to get Model #300. As I said in the subject, this product looks like a great idea, but the marketing lacks an important fact (which I find unnecessarily deceptive) so I am giving it a sub-par rating. It does NOT take much effort to list these very important specs that would help people buy precisely what they need, especially when this info is contained on the back of the product itself. I found the #300 model on another site and am purchasing it separately. I'm also returning the one I got here. If you're going to get this product, pull out a ruler or measuring tape and measure your lid to ensure you get the right fitting model. Thanks for reading. …",355 out of 360 users found this review helpful

 A fine and sturdy everyday tea,4,"This is a very drinkable blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan black teas from PG Tips, one of the UK's most popular brands. Although some California grocery stores stock this tea, I had not tried it until reading helpful reviews on Superstore. Each PG Tips bag weighs 38 percent more than the Lipton bag (that is available in the USA). As expected, PG Tips makes a stronger brew. Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag. PG Tips is a sturdy, straight-ahead blend with more strength than Lipton's. It is a caffeine-rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands. PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. Does it make better tea? I don't know, but it is a point of differentiation. HINT: PG Tips also makes a Special Blend black tea that is only slightly more expensive in stores. I much prefer the Special Blend to their regular black tea. The PG Tips Special Blend is a very hardy and rich breakfast tea. The Special Blend is more sensitive to longer steeping times (I usually steep mine less than 3 minutes), but I find the taste more complex and satisfying. Many prefer loose tea because tea bags contain the less expensive ""fannings"" or ""dust,"" remains from processing loose leaf tea. And with some others brands of tea (not PG Tips), some people can taste the paper used in the bag. If you (like I) sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags, I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea. And, I more strongly recommend their Special Blend as a hardy and rich breakfast tea. …",34 out of 36 users found this review helpful

 I Can't Understand the negative reviews,4,"I bought two of these, and have been using them for a couple weeks now. They are well built, they seal nicely, and they work great. I've been testing them out on various teas - loose chamomile, green tea, I even took some Tazo out of the tea bags and tried it in the Solofill - all tests passed with flying colors. There isn't much documentation out there for using a Keurig as a tea brewer from loose, but I am extremely pleased withe the results so far - it will press tea from too weak to overly strong depending on grind and amount. I ground some coffee and tried it in the solo - it was great. The pressed coffee using Solofill and Keurig tastes superior to the drip-brewed coffee in our Melitta or Krups coffee maker. A coarser grind on teas and coffees seems to work better, on fine grind the water has trouble pressing through the medium. Cleaning them is quite easy, as long as you don't wait for the grounds to dry overnight inside the Solofill. …",30 out of 31 users found this review helpful

 Easy as Pie!,5,"This pie crust mix is the easiest and most consistent I have used. I love it. I have been dealing with Celiac Disease for over 10 years. I also live in a small rural community and can only get gluten free products with when going into Albuquerqe NM and visiting the health food store. Before my diagnosis I was a pie making queen (goddess if you will). It was very hard to give up, but if you can't taste your wares, you loose all quality control. I have experimented with different flours, tried different recipies and books everything. This is the one that works the most like a typical pie crust. This is my advice: 1) Use a hand mixer to cut in the shortening. I don't know why it works, it wouldn't with regular flour, but it does. 2) Keep it in a ziploc bag at least over night. The way the shortening combines with the dry ingredients overnight makes it much easier to work with. 3) Keep sweet rice flour, corn or potato starch on hand for rolling purposes, and roll it out using wax paper or foil. I also prefer to make smaller tarts using a muffin pan just because rolling to that size is easiest and you can control serving size that way.

" Week flavor and leaves tea ""powder"" in the cup.",3,"I really enjoy tea, and especially Earl Grey. I do not drink coffee, soda or anything else other then tea and water. So I find myself drinking lots of tea. When I purchased my Keurig, I also bought a selection of teas from Celestial Seasonings, which included their Earl Grey and English Breakfast. After using them up, I decided to try the Earl Grey from Twinings for K-cups but was disappointed. The flavor was quite weak, not to say everyone likes a strong tea, but those who enjoy the sophisticated taste of Earl Grey, often like it to have a bolder taste then what this produced. Also it left a lot of unpleasant tea powder at the bottom of the tea cup which gave the cup of tea an unappealing appearance of being dirty. I would have just assumed that this was the best a Keurig maker could do to produce a cup of tea if I hadn't already had 2 boxes of Celestial Seasoning teas that produced stronger tea with no muddy appearance. I was quite surprised with this result because I ordered the Twinings tea with the assumption that it would be better then the Celestial Seasoning.

This marzipan is made with corn syrup instead of sugar, has a low almond content, and is flavored with a hint of citrus that masks any almond flavor whatsoever. I may as well have been eating lemon-scented glue sticks. Even more interesting is that I froze the unused marzipan in the same bag with a 'better' variety. Within three months this marzipan had taken on a freezer taste, whereas the higher grade marzipan still tastes great even one year later.
