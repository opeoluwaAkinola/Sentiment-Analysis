 dried cherries,2,"I wish I was more positive, but I am not really happy with the product. I have bought Traverse Bay Cherries in the past. These cherries have an off taste as if they have been in storage too long and are far too over plump as to suggest extra sugar has been added to increase weight. Michigan cherries from Traverse Bay has been an excellent product in the past. I suspect these are second rate in some fashion. …",15 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Salmon Dog Treats,5,"Mini Naturals - 1 pound - Salmon Flavored Great product for training dogs! I use them all the time for training (walking on a lead, sitting, fetching). They are high in flavor so even with our 7 month Golden Retriever, treats cut in half work well for a reward. Unlike dog kibble or other treats, these are quickly digested so that your dog will not be gagging on them as he/she works on the next behavior. To keep fresh, keep bag tightly closed and put a portion of the cut treats in a resealable sandwich bag. If they do get exposed to air and dry out, a small portion of a moistened paper towel in the bag will restore them to original texture. …",137 out of 163 users found this review helpful

" Fantastic Coffee, BUT...",4,"BEST INSTANT, PERIOD! BUT... I can't drink VIA made according to it's instructions. It's just way, WAY, too strong. (I'm talking seriously stronger than what you get at a local Starbucks.) Let me explain. When I make brewed coffee, I freshly grind beans to a very fine texture, using two or three tablespoons of grounds per 6 ounces of water. So I'm used to a strong cup of coffee. Since one packet of VIA makes even a large mug of water into an un-drinkablly strong brew, I use only half a packet. The problem is, a couple hours later, the left-over half becomes an unusable blob that won't come out of the packet. No great loss... I've had a GREAT cup of coffee, and I can just toss the other half packet, right? Well, acutally, that's a problem for me. I'm of the 'clean your plate / starving kids in Biafra' generation. I would prefer a smaller packet at a smaller price. So one star off from someone who was taught 'waste not, want not' and is too old to change ;-) …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" Good quality, highly recommended",5,"The Sapporo noodles are more expensive than the ones you find at the local supermarket, but they are also a notch above the cheaper brands. The noodles do not bloat up and get mushy when boiled. As a consequence, the cooked noodles have a pleasant Al dente bite. The spice pack is pretty delicious, and I frequently boil some frozen dumplings from Trader Joe's when I make these noodles. The price offered on Superstore is really awesome. My local supermarket is selling these for $1 per pack. To be healthy: (a) throw away the spice pack. These noodle spice packs, any brand, are high in sodium, fats, MSG. (b) boil noodles and throw away the water. These noodles, any brand, are coated with a waxy substance to protect their freshness. They will come out when you boil it- so pour away the water. The noodles will taste better too. …",25 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 Buy through Superstore - there web site. Seeds not so good,1,"I bought these seeds through wheatgrasskit web site - it is not a secure web site. I was stupid bought anyways though that site and had false credit card purchases made within 2 days of purchase. Also I grow my wheatgrass by hydroponic, and the seeds don't so so well. They are slow to spout, the roots are rotting quicker than the growth. So I'm not getting a tall grass to juice with plus I have to watch the mold. Also I thought all seeds would be equal, but even the taste seems different and my stomach has to have smaller amounts of juice. My biggest regret is purchased 20lbs because I juice ALOT, and regret buying from this vender. I hope other buyers have better succes. Mine was just not so good. …",21 out of 29 users found this review helpful
 I'm only meh about this particular Lavazza coffee.,4,"Let me start by saying I love Lavazza coffee. I generally get the Crema e Gusto or the Qualita Rossa and I find them both incredibly delicious coffees. I thought I'd expand my Lavazza palate a bit and try the Tierra and so I confidently ordered the 3 can pack, but as I'm beginning can #2, I'm finding myself simply waiting out the use of cans 2 and 3 so I can go back to my regular Crema. The Tierra is not bad coffee - not by a long shot. It's smooth and... the word I keep thinking of is ""light"", especially if you're used to drinking a darker, richer roast. It has that slight lemon aftertaste on my tongue that Columbian coffee has, and I don't like that at all so I add flavored creamer to disguise that after taste rather than my normal warmed regular cream . And once the flavored creamer is added, it disguises the good as well as the bad flavors so I'm left feeling like I'm missing out on the coffeeness of my coffee. Also, I find myself using nearly twice as much ground coffee to make a pot as I use of the Crema or Qualita Rossa, so the cans themselves will only last half as long. Having said all that, I'm giving it four stars because my parents are visiting and this morning I made them the Tierra for breakfast and they really loved it. They both prefer a lighter roast and usually cream the heck out of their coffee at my house to dilute it down a bit. The Tierra they found delicious. So I'm giving it 4 stars to differentiate it from my favorite Lavazzas (which are 5s!) but also to acknowledge that this is probably really good coffee for those who enjoy a lighter roast. …",28 out of 29 users found this review helpful
 GREAT COMFORT DRINK! AND NO GUILT!,5,"Ferrara Instant Espresso Coffee, 2-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 6) I have been using this brand of Ferrara, Instant Espresso Coffee for about a decade now, often daily in cool weather. You don't need to use a lot of the product to get a full body cup of coffee with crema on top, so the price is right for me! I have tried other instant espresso coffees and I prefer this one. Originally I was in a gourmet store and this is where I found this coffee. Then after trying to locate this brand at a place with a better price tag I found it at World Market, but then they stopped carrying it, however, perhaps they have it back on their shelves again, I do not know. Soon later I began buying it from Sunset Foods in Highland Park, IL. They, like World Market, had it in stock only now and then so I began to order it special from them. After a few orders I decided to check Superstore since Superstore has become so much more of a store for me than books and movies! Now I have an Superstore SUBSCRIPTION for this product to ship to me automatically. To get the BEST PRICE I put this item in my WISHLIST FOR THE PURPOSE OF WATCHING FOR THE PRICE TO LOWER, & WHEN IT DOES I ORDER FOR AN IMMEDIATE SHIPMENT AT THE BEST PRICE *STILL* THROUGH MY SUBSCRIPTION WHICH GIVES ME AN *ADDITIONAL* 15% OFF THE THEN SALE PRICE!! The product itself: I have found this instant coffee consistent over the decade I have used it. Normally you will find this in Italian stores or high-end stores. I like the CONVENIENCE of getting a GREAT cup of SMOOTH coffee just heating water in my microwave and then adding the Ferrara Instant powder. If the water is hot enough the drink will have a lovely thick crema on top. Note: This coffee does not taste like actual coffee, but it doesn't taste anything like any other instant coffee on the shelves either, not like any other instant espresso from any company, and certainly nothing like those grocery store brand instant coffees which I find gross..., however, I admit find grocery store brand ground coffee like Folgers and Maxwell House, etc. to taste like garbage in my opinion! For daily drip (real) coffee at my house we use Lavazza or the online subscription Gevalia brand. So why do I also use an instant coffee like Ferrara? Well, as I said, I love the SMOOTH taste, it gives a comforting hot drink that has a lovely flavor, and with hot enough water you will get a thick crema on top once you drop the powder into the hot water. It is fast, and quite wonderful. And may I add one more thing? It takes away hunger for a couple of hours! I just love it!! …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 ...great for Hair!,5,"I recently bought this product after hearing great reviews on it and I can say that I definitely agree. I use this on my hair exclusively, I am an African-American and have natural hair. I usually just ""seal"" my hair with this, which it's good for, but it can be greasy. I don't really know how to combat that, but it doesn't really have too much of a smell either, which is good b/c I don't know how I feel about the smell of coconut. The amount is quite enough for the price, but depending on how much you use it may not last as long as it looks like it will. Mine probably won't last too long, but I will definitely buy again. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 4 oz. Great American Popcorn Portion Packs,5,"We purchased a popcorn machine for our media room which called for the 4oz. packs of popcorn. The machine was purchased at Sam's Club where the popcorn packs were not available. Not finding this in town, we went to Superstore where we found exactly what we needed. It works perfectly in our machine. One thing to be aware of: the butter/oil packet comes solid and you squeeze it into the machine. When we first opened the case we thought that the butter/oil was old and had solidified. We needed to look it up on the Great American Popcorn site to assure ourselves that we did not need to send it back.

 everything you need in one box,5,"I have been a sushi fan for many years, but have always been shy about making it myself. After searching online at the dozens of different options, I decided to go with the Sushi Chef Sushi Making Kit. And I wasn't disappointed. Too many sushi kits out there offer just the rolling mat, or dishes and the rolling mat, but no spoon, or all the dishes but no edible components. With this kit, you have the mat, the spoon, and all the edibles necessary sans the actual fillings (fish, veggies, etc.) And not only does the kit have edible components, they are top notch. The wasabi is scorchingly spicy, the rice vinegar is tangy, and the rice cooks and clumps together with ease. The soy sauce and wasabi are so good, in fact, that I would go out of my way to buy them if I saw them at a store somewhere. But, the best part of this kit is the manual. It's straightforward, written in simple English, and has very nice photos. As I read each page of instructions, I feel like I'm being walked through step-by-step by a close friend. I made darned good sushi my very first try. Criticisms? Hmmm... not many. The price is right. Maybe it'd be nice if they had a special ""sushi knife"" or something enclosed, but whatever. Bottom line: if you're looking to make sushi at home for the first time, you won't be sorry with this purchase. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

I'd throw in some sliced green onion and some sesame seeds too, but your call. Then, you throw in the honey roasted cashews. You can even go with half a cup or more of these things. Throw in some fresh berries. You get crunchy, salty, and sweet all covered right there. Now here's what you do: Make your dressing with 1/2 cut vegetable oil, 4 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar, and 1 half teaspoon of pepper. Seriously, it's good.

 Don't buy this poison!,1,"We received a free sample of Feline Greenies in the mail today from PETCO. Our 13 indoor cats gobbled the entire 1-oz. package in less than 10 minutes. Even our finicky eaters loved them. We are very careful pet owners, double-checking every ingredient in anything that they eat (in the same way that we watch our own food). Unfortunately, I fed first and checked later (something that I have NEVER done before and will never do again)! Imagine my dismay when I found menadione sodium bisulfite in this product. This toxic, unapproved ingredient has no business in our pet food. Its use is prohibited in many European countries, and our own FDA won't approve it. We have requested that PETCO discontinue the sale of this product immediately, until the manufacturer removes this poison. If you love your cats, you will not feed this product to them. Just do a web search for ""menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB)"". You'll be a better cat owner, that's for sure . . . …",15 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Ajinomoto Hon Dashi,5,"I buy this locally in a much larger box but it is the same product. This product is just as good as making your own, which I did for years before finding it. The larger box has 1,000 servings but that is for a weak dashi so I use double the granules. For this product with the 3 packets, just add them into a small jar and use 1 ts per cup hot water (adjust to your tastes). That adjustment is why it says '3 to 6 cups'. Also, this product stores with no loss in flavor in a sealed container for years. I actually have some in a salt shaker (with rice to keep it dry) and use it commonly as a flavor boost to vegetables (green ones especially work well with it). This is actually a good starter size box. For those not sure what to do with it, a sample recipe: 3 cups made up dashi (1 packet)- taste and add water if you wish it weaker. 1 packet Udon noodles (may use cooked spagetti) appx 1.25 cups volume 1 cup lightly packed leafy vegetables (spinach, mustard greens, cabbages etc) Optional- baby bok choys whole, shellfish (whole or chopped), peeled shrimp, miso Bring to a simmer and as soon as the veggies and optional meats are done to your liking, it's ready.

 Best litterbox I have used hands down.,5,"I have owned 3 of these with 4 different large (up to 16 lbs) cats and a variety of litter types. I would like to echo Esther G.'s review - this box is amazing if used ""correctly""!! I'll try and explain another way for the sake of repetition. This system comes with 2 bottoms: at any time one bottom contains the litter (let's call this the ""active box"") and the other is empty (the ""standby box""). The boxes fit inside of eachother so the standby is stored below the active box. In fact, the lid won't seal properly unless the boxes and sifter are all stacked together in a nice package. There are two major ways to use the system - the NASTY WAY and the AWESOME WAY: ******** NASTY WAY (most people do this): Most everyone leaves the sifter inside the active box so that the litter itself is sitting inside the sifter. The sifter, in turn, sits inside the active box. From top to bottom we have: SIFTER (contains litter) ACTIVE STANDBY When it's time to change the litter, people simply pull the sifter out and dump the contents into the trash. The sifter then goes into the standby box and the (cleaned) litter is dumped from one box to the other. What was previously the active box is now the standby box and everything gets re-stacked like before. This is the most obvious way and I think the product literature even suggests this. However, there is a small gap between the sifter and active box which leaves room for liquid to gather below (and around) the sifter. Clumping litter will clump *around* the holes in the sifter and create clogs. This also allows for some small clumps to gather on the inside walls of the box - these get smeared over time. After a week or two, you're left with a messy, stinky box and a sifter that needs lots of attention. ******** ******** AWESOME WAY (everyone should do this): You can eliminate the clumping inside the sifter if you don't leave the sifter sitting in the litter!! You can order the boxes like this: ACTIVE (contains litter) SIFTER STANDBY When it's time to clean, you simply pull the active box out and pour its contents (including clumped waste) into the sifter (which is sitting inside the standby box). Next, you pull the sifter out like you would have done for the NASTY WAY. The sifter now contains all the waste but, since it hasn't been sitting in the waste, doesn't have any clumps or clogs!! Throw away the waste, put the sifter into the empty box, and stack everything up. Voila! You're done. ******** I have 2 cats sharing 1 of these boxes. I can completely clean the box in less than 1 minute using this method. This allows me to clean the box every day without trouble. I change out the litter once every few weeks, rub down the insides every few months and do a deep clean maybe twice a year. That's seriously low maintenance and I have the cleanest box of anyone I know!! That includes those with fancy auto-cleaning systems! …",113 out of 114 users found this review helpful

 Better than EVERYTHING,5,"5 stars, 10 if it were possible. 2 mini-doxies who ate homemade from birth to 2, then went onto 'natural' kibble (Holistic Blendz, Hund n Flocken) and developed urine crystals, then went to a vet kibble that got rid of the crystals but developed another crystal. I needed a solution that wouldn't take all day to prepare, and without grain (dachshunds are better off with potatoes as their starch, no rice or corn). First impressions - smells good helped by garlic and oh look! I can actually recognize the bits of potato, broccoli and carrots! - add water, so far pretty easy. Add beef? I can't bring myself to do the raw thing, but I get organic ground beef from Costco, poach it, and when it's cooled down I add it to the Europa. Store 3-4 days worth in the frig, and it's done. Doggies used to sniff at the kibble and swallow enough of it to sustain life. Now they can't wait to eat. They're down to healthy weights, which is key for doxie backs, and the vet proclaims the smooth is the ""best looking dachshund"" he has ever seen. They're running and playing like puppies at the ripe old age of 7. I give them Missing Link Plus supplements, Cosequin DS to keep joints in good shape. I feel like I'm doing a good thing for them, and I want them around me for many more years to come. I can't thank Sojourner Farms enough for understanding the need for grain-free food, let alone the absolute purity of preparation and ingredients. Someone there actually thought about the dog first. I'm sure it takes longer to prep and dehydrate the vegetables than to pulverize and kibble-ize something far less healthy, but Sojos is doing it anyway and I for one am grateful for the product. Costly? I can't even calculate the value when I see the difference it has made in my dogs after just 2 months. They ship it free from the Sojos web site, and so does Superstore. Friends, just do it. You can make it in the time it takes you to cook supper. You'd do it for your kids. And your dogs don't talk back!! …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",19 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Two Paws Up!,5,"My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them. But I needn't have worried, they loved it!

 Really good for what it is,5,"This was very different from what I originally expected it to be. That being said, I found this to be probably the best k-cup I have ever had. It is very creamy and has a great hazelnut flavor. I enjoy a cappucino once in a while and I love hazelnut coffee. I expected this to be more of cappucino with a light hazelnut flavor. That was not the case. This is like a creamy coffee/hazelnut flavored hot cocoa without the cocoa. I was expecting something completely different but ended up being pleasantly surprised. This is a great after dinner or mid day pick-me-up and this will now hold a permanent row or two in my revolving k-cup counter top display. If you want a real cappucino, this isn't for you. If you want a great tasting hot liquid sweet snack, get this. I liked this so much, I will be ordering the French vanilla version to give that a try as soon as I complete this review.

" Unique, yet ubiquitous use",5,"The Vietnamese styled coffee filter is really a nice bit of kit. It makes the often mundane act of drinking coffee into a ritual. While its origins are south-east Asian, its has a cosmopolitan use that is quite underrated. If you're like me and have several different blends of coffee in your home to choose from, its nice to offer guests their choice of coffee without having to make several pots to do so. You can alter the strength of the coffee by how tightly you compress the top filter in this apparatus. Thus enabling a ""Lungo"" or ""ristretto"" type of taste as you would find with espresso machines. This is however, not technically an espresso maker as espresso is made by forcing water through the ground coffee beans, while this apparatus uses gravity to distill the coffee. Many people who first experience these will be in specialty Vietnamese restaurants, offered as a traditional ""C&agrave; phê su'a d&aacute;"" (translated ""Coffee milk ice""), but you should be able to find this nice little filter at many oriental specialty shops for anywhere between $3-$4. Don't worry about manufacturer, as I have seen several, and there seems to be absolutely no difference in quality. So don't pay a high price for this item. Often, the best things are the simplest, and it doesn't get any simpler than this. It should last you decades of use. …",24 out of 26 users found this review helpful

I'll drink lots of the tea for the next baby. Why not? UPDATE: Drank this stuff again during my 2nd pregnancy. Baby was out in 3 pushes. The midwives said I make delivery look easy.

 Excellent product... until Superstore ships it!,2,"I want to start by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily. It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it. Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Superstore anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer. The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic. Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top. Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car. Superstore customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition. In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No. And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism. I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Superstore, too. I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem. Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste. If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice. …",41 out of 47 users found this review helpful
 Food Should Taste Good ....,5,"... and these do!! Wow! I was really surprised at how good these chips are. These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there. The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right. They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips. Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt. Not these. An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium. For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts. Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack. Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges? These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers. Yum!! I'll definitely be purchasing these from Superstore -- I've never seen them in the stores, and I simply must have more of them! …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Rough Stuff,1,"I didn't have such luck with this product as the other reviewers--unfortunately I got SEVERE abdominal cramps the few times I tried it. Still, it's worth a try because it works for many people. Just bear in mind that if you get some bad cramping, you are probably sensitive to SENNA, the active ingredient in the tea. So stay away from other SENNA products, too. (usually labeled ""Stimulant Laxative."") So what works for me? Lots of the high-fiber foods every day. Plenty of raw fruits (except banana) and vegetables (two raw carrots a day works wonders!) Whole grains every day makes a big difference--I especially like brown rice and oatmeal. Apples are yummy: I eat one every day. Eating beans and legumes is also very helpful. Buy some dried lentils--they cook the fastest--and google some soup recipes. And keep products made with white flour to a minimum. In the worst case scenario, try plain old water. Both ways. Nature is great. …",6 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 They changed it and now it is AWFUL!!,1,"I've never reviewed anything before, but have relied on reviews for many purchases. If this keeps anyone else from buying this new soup thinking it is the same as the old one, then it's worth it. I've purchased and eaten the old version of the Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Chicken Ramen Big Cup Soup for several years. When I suddenly couldn't get the 2.1 oz soup cups, and this appeared (1.8 oz soup cup), I bought 3 boxes of 6. I ate the first one a few days ago, and barely could choke it down. The broth in no way resembles chicken broth, it's brown and watery and has a slight trace of miso or soy flavor, with a bitter after taste. YUCK! Don't buy this, unless or until they re-formulate it again to once again be edible and resemble chicken soup. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

And, best of all, no more itching or hot spots. Vet believes that she was allergic to corn products in Iams; a common allergy for dogs.

Their bowel movements are more normal now, and they no longer have problems with their **** glands getting full/hard and needing to be emptied like they did with the other food. I was surprised to find negative reviews for this food. I understand the one review about the dogs not being interested in the food, but please, people of Superstore, don't write negative reviews for products because your local store sold you an expired bag. 1) that has nothing to do with Superstore, and 2) that really has nothing to do with the product quality -- the manufacturer didn't sell it to you that way, it was probably just on the shelf for too long.

 I love Fog Chaser,5,"Fog Chaser is my favorite coffee and I buy it in whole beans for when I brew a full pot. I have used it for years and would not think of changing. When I saw Superstore had Fog Chaser for the Keurig I was thrilled. The flavor is full bodied and rich with a very smooth finish. Because I was familiar with Fog Chaser, I never even looked at the reviews before I made my purchase. Therefore, I was rather surprised when I opened the box and saw the different type of pod. With a filter bottom the pod seems much more environmentally friendly. There was no residue at the bottom of my mug so the filter did a good job. I agree with other reviewers of the need to keep these pods in a vacuum sealed container (or zip lock bag) but I think the use of less platics is a good thing. I have a B60 and these fit perfectly in the machine. I used the large cup setting and the strength of the coffee was perfect for my taste (I prefer stronger coffee).

 Poison,1,"POISON ""Chlorhexidine"" POISON We have two beautiful Saint Bernards. After using these for some time, it began to be a routine that they would BOTH have to go outside to vomit after their supposed morning treat and dental care. We investigated this chemical that the package warns you about, ""Chlorhexidine"" and stopped using the ignorantly designed dog hating treat. No more sick dogs. If anyone likes their Dog at all, they will READ the package. Notice first the ingredient, ""Chlorhexidine"" then the warnings. There's good vets who don't sell these, and BAD vets who like the profits. Of course, Pharma and all their ""vet/doctor"" salesmen will say this product has been tested, used for years, found to be safe in thus and thus quantities, and on and on. Well, the chemical Chlorhexidine is used to KILL bacteria. GOOD AND BAD! It's used pre-surgically, washing the body and prescription only mouthwashes. Your dog, like all living beings has a body especially a digestive tract, FULL of very much needed bacterium. The company knows this, and to protect themselves even warns that ""serious"" problems may occur, especially if your dog ""licks"" the surface first? Wow, and how is a dog supposed to NOT lick a dog chew he's sucking on for hours and yet consume it? Do some research on what this stuff WILL do to your dog people. Unless your trying to euthanize your dog with a long, painful, and; ""conveniently- racking up a massive vet bill to diagnose"" and non treatable death sentence, STOP FEEDING THEM THIS POISON. And YES, they are the same ""intellectual scientists"" who've managed to put half our nation on ""safe for you"" psychotropic drugs. Ironically, ""prolonged use of this poison will cause tooth discoloration,"" leading to possible other side effects of tooth decay."" Japan stopped using ""Chlorhexidine"" on catheters and other medical devices in 97' after many became sick and one died. Causes numerous (still discovering more) problems with cats. Deafness, respiratory problems, in 96 in Mitchell South Dakota they discovered it was the cause of a plethora of severe issues with cats and had to stop using it. The believe it was from the cats ""grooming"" it off their coats after surgery. Too many problems to report here, do your dog a favor and do your own. And don't look get your information from the doggy sites. Look up the problems with the chemical. Is it like declawing your animal? ""And they tell you it doesn't hurt them when they rip the dew claws out at the puppy age?"" Yeah, I'd like to declaw a few vets (Pharma salesmen) and have them give me a report? Most importantly, you do not want to kill ANY bacteria in your dogs system.

 The best Earl Grey!,5,"This is the best tea I've ever tasted - period! Each canister has a double lid plus comes sealed in plastic to preserve the flavor. On opening the lid, the rush of bergamot aroma hits your nose. Wow! You also smell the flavor of the black tea (unlike some other Earl Grey brands where all you get is the bergamot). The leaves are indeed the prized small buds from the top of the plant. This tea cannot be over-brewed. I left it longer than 5 minutes a couple of times and it never became bitter or acidic. Always you taste the smooth black tea and the bergamot is strong but never over-powering. I also like that you're supporting a local grower and the workers instead of being syphoned off into a large mega-corporation. If you like Earl Grey, get this tea!

 DO NOT SPEND A DIME ON THIS VENDING MACHINE!,1,"Simply put, this vending machine is a piece of ****. And, dealing with the company is even worse. Just check the long list of complaints they have at the Better Business Bureau. That said here is the breakdown on how the machine works: Coin Mechanism - Most likely the worst Coin Mech in the Vending Business. Anyone with a piece of straw, a paper clip or even with their car keys can easily tamper it and get free candy. After a couple of months of use, it will start jamming and will work with everything BUT quarters. Unlike in the feature description, these plastic coin mechanisms will not last very long with normal use. Chute Doors - The chute doors are made of plastic. Very WEAK plastic. They will not last a week of normal use. This will leave an extremely unattractive machine that looks like a toothless Hockey player. Not to mention how unsanitary that is. Canisters - Sure the easy on, easy off design might be the best any company has come up with. However, the canisters are so weak that I have had them crack on my hands while cleaning them. Another flaw would be that these clear canisters will turn yellowish within a month if exposed to indirect sunlight of strong fluorescent lighting. Even if they aren't, they will still turn yellowish within a year. Plus, they are very poorly manufactured. Finally these canisters would not only NOT keep the candy fresh, but also it is very easy for insects to get inside and make a total mess. Housing - This would be the piece attached to the metal pole and base and holds the canisters and coin mechs. It is so poorly made, that within a couple of months it will start to crack. I have had customers call me to tell me the machine fell on the floor. Imagine if it had fallen on top of a child! The Back ""Security"" Door - It is incredibly weak and made of plastic. Anyone with a screwdriver can steal your quarters without even breaking it. The Company - The Manufactures are Multivend. They might be one of the worst companies to deal with. As I said before, just read the complaints they have at the Better Business Bureau. If you are looking for a novelty TOY, this machine would be perfect if they didn't want to charge you over $100.00 for each (A new Unit can set you back almost $400.00). I would pay no more than $40.00 for a unit. But, if you are looking for an investment, then look elsewhere. I can recommend the Beaver Machines. Those are the best in the market.

 Disappointing,3,"I thoroughly enjoy Betty's and Taylor's of Harrogate. I had high expecations for this tea but it is quite mediocre. Yes, it's far better than PG Tips, but frankly, I think I prefer Tetley's. Even Lipton comes close to this Yorkshire Gold. There's just nothing exceptional about it. I expected to to be more like the better whole leaf teas that I enjoy. It's just another bag of dust and fannings. For an everyday tea, it's barely drinkable. Everyone has their preferences. Some like Darjeeling, Ceylon, Yunan, or traditional blends like English Breakfast. Some like bergamot (Earl Grey) or the smokey flavour of Lapsang Souchong or a Scotish Breakfast. Personally, I favour a pure Assam. It's hard to tell exactly what Yorkshire Gold is. They say it's a blend from twenty tea gardens. I suppose that actually means it's a collection of nearly everyone's refuse. Taylor's does sell better quality loose leaf teas and although I haven't tried enough of them, I'm sure they're quite good. Update: I have found that this makes the most outstanding iced tea. I highly recommend it for that. For a cheap bagged tea, I stand by Tetley's.

 Good Superauto for the Money,5,"I recently purchased a Vienna Superautomatica as an inexpensive second espresso maker. The first thing I noticed is that it is Italian made like many of the great espresso machines. The body of the Vienna is ""graphite"" plastic, and while it does not feel first class, it somehow has a pretty sturdy feel to it. I also like that the footprint is pretty small thus taking up little counter space. I opened the manual, which is not particularly clear, but need not be on account of very simple operation. The Vienna has three buttons--on/off, coffee, and steam. It also has a steamer control **** and a water volume ****. I turned on the machine after filling the coffee and water tanks. The buttons feel Italian--you'll know what I mean if you've owned an Alfa Romeo. They are a bit clunky next to my old Capresso C1000, but they work well (for now). The Vienna takes a couple of minutes to warm up--I don't mind this for reasons I'll reveal in a minute. The coffee spout is adjustable up and down to accommodate a large variety of cups and mugs. Once it's ready, the coffee light stops blinking. I push the button and it begins to grind the coffee. The noise level of the machine is louder than my Capresso, but not too bad. You might wake up the house with it in the morning, but my child stayed asleep. Once the coffee finishes the grind, the Vienna immediately begins making espresso. My first impression was that I saw a lot more steam coming from the coffee than my Capresso. I am hopeful. The coffee also looked a bit thicker than the Capresso. After the Vienna finished I observed the cup: nice crema, plenty hot, and smells like the genuine article. I gave it a taste--wow, step aside Capresso, this espresso is richer, hotter, and a lot closer to coffee bar espresso. Next I took a sip. Ah yes, the cup holds rich chocolatey espresso. If you are sort of a coffee snob, you'll like what you taste. The coffee is much richer than the Capresso, which I attribute to hotter water and fuller extraction. I'm sure that the Vienna will not make good enough espresso for some folks, but to me, it still tastes better than Starbucks. It was more than $100 cheaper than my Capresso and frankly makes better espresso. I cannot yet speak to the durability of the machine, but the Vienna is now my favorite inexpensive espresso maker. …",77 out of 78 users found this review helpful

She worked to remove the head and tail of the dino and while we were able to get the larger pieces from her, she swallowed several very small pieces. And much to our embarrassment, at her first vet visit (3 days after adoption) we were told to stop giving her whatever ""white plastic"" toy she was chewing and eating. Enough pieces had gotten into and through her system to cause the vet concern she may not pass all of them. I am giving this product 1 star because: 1) It is described as a product for powerful chewers - it did not hold up 2) It is rated for dogs up to 50 pounds - while on the upper end of the scale, our dog fits into that category and the product did not hold up 3) the vet warned us to stop using the product as the size and shape of the pieces were potentially harmful to our dog. …",40 out of 42 users found this review helpful

" A Horse Is a Horse Is a Snack, Of Course",4,"My dog is constantly out to get me. Keeping little miss 'Princess Paws' from rooting through the trash, diddling the carpets or wrecking the house is like trying to keep Lindsey Lohan out of dive bars, crack dens and paparazzi mug shots. In other words -- nearly impossible. But lord help me, I try. I bought a bag of these biscuits, thinking I could coax the mutt into good behavior through 'positive reinforcement'. Though the idea sort of fizzles when the dog is too finicky to eat the stupid things. She gave the tiniest of disinterested exploratory sniffs, then scrunched her furry little schnozz like I was offering her a handful of barf-encrusted ****. (Which, based on her previous dietary choices, she would actually eat. Tasty baked tidbit? No, thanks; I'm trying to keep my greyhoundish figure. The poop du jour in half-digested BLEEEH-rnaise sauce? Mmmm-mmmm! Bon appeturd!) I tried to entice her, but she wasn't having it. I even tried a little nibble myself, to prove I wasn't trying to poison her. (Yet.) And actually, the biscuit was pretty good. It's got a nice crunch, with a taste somewhere between a heavy water cracker and reconstituted horse meal. But pretty light on the 'horse meal' part. All in all, not bad. I'd give it about a four on the people-food scale -- somewhere between a stale bag of Funyuns and a plain rice cake eaten off a sweaty Clydesdale's back. I finished the first one and had another. Pretty soon I'd gone through half the bag. So this was a complete waste for the dog. But I found a new snack for TV nights. Now if I'm out of popcorn, I set out a bowl of biscuits and munch away. They're not gourmet. But they're filling, and I'm getting my recommended daily allowance of hoof meat all in one sitting. That's a winner. …",9 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Best cheese curls - UPDATED: overpriced and poor quality,5,"I won't say I'm an expert in cheese curls, but these sure taste great. Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Superstore price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective. UPDATE December 11, 2009 Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag ""freshness guaranteed."" That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients). I'd give this one star today if I could. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" Excellent food, excellent value",5,"I have been researching and studying canine nutrition since about 1988. Ironically, my interest sprang from a program that Hill's (makers of Science Diet) used to offer called the Small Animal Dietician program. I completed all levels that they offered and learned quite a bit about food, most especially, NOT to feed Science Diet, lol. That being said, I have been showing and breeding dogs for over 20 years. I have tried virtually every high end food on the market: Core, EVO, The Honest Kitchen, Before Grain, Prairie, Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Canidae, California Natural....I could go on. The *extremely* high protein content in some of those foods can be quite dangerous, especially for puppies. I just had to euthanize my 3 year old Staffordshire Bull Terrier in December due to kidney failure, and I am certain it was brought on by being on Before Grain, Orijen & EVO as a puppy. Chicken Soup is a fantastic food and a great value. I am currently feeding it to my Bullmastiff and 2 Chihuahuas, one of whom is almost 16 years old.

 Really Really Sweet!,5,"I was fairly skeptical when trying these, thinking they'd probably have little to no affect on me. I was way off. The tablets themselves are actually pretty nasty, like sucking on a vitamin, they take some time to dissolve so you've really got to be willing to put up with having these fairly unpleasant things in your mouth for at least 3-5 minutes. I recommend rolling them around all over the top of your tongue as you do, and trying not to swallow too often so you can really let your tongue absorb as much as it can. Another tip is that if you plan on trying this with liquids, do so after you've tried it with more solid foods as liquids will dissipate the effects much quicker. I gave it the old lemon test and I was shocked at just how sweet and delicious they were. Really, it made lemons taste like delicious lemon candy, not at all like those artificially flavored lemon drops. Natural applesauce was a bit much, but apples are already sweet so I sort of expected it. I also tried cheese, carrots, peanut butter, and while the peanut butter seemed a bit sweeter, the others didn't seem to show any affect at all. What impressed me the most, however, was tea. I poured myself a tall glass of unsweetened Lipton and it wasn't at all what I expected. Rather than making it taste sweet, it just removed the bitterness. Again, it's hard to articulate the sensation, but I can say that if you've ever wondered what tea tastes like without being overpowered by sweeteners or the natural bitterness found in most teas, try it with these tablets. The effect will wear off after a few minutes when you drink, but the taste you get is so uniquely pure. In all honesty, you haven't experienced tea until you've had a cup with one of these. I've read that wine is also good, so I may try that sometime in the future, along with other bitter fruits. I'm also curious how tomatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and bell peppers will taste. Whatever I decide, I really feel these things have opened up a whole new world of flavor experiences, and I'm really looking forward to trying them all. I totally recommend these tabs just for the experience, but as an alternative to sugar, they're way too expensive at this point. Happy Tasting! …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 The cereal that started a legacy.,5,"Brought to us by cereal giant General Mills, Golden Grahams is a delectable, yet simple, cereal that inspired such General Mills products as Cinnamon Toast Crunch and French Toast Crunch. Golden Graham squares are relatively the same size as other square cereals, though the pieces tend to be thinner and crunchier than those of Golden Grahams' aforementioned cousins. The taste is basic but delicious, utilizing a honey and cinnamon mixture that is highly addictive. I recall with much fondness eating half a box of these every Saturday as a kid, restraining myself from finishing the entire box only so I would have some left for Sunday. Though taste is obviously the most important feature of any cereal, its ability to hold up against the penetrating and destructive power of milk is a close second. It is my pleasure to tell you that Golden Grahams hold up commendably. Though they lose their crunch fairly quickly, they remain in one piece and retain all of their flavor even after many minutes in the bowl. Furthermore, Golden Grahams has a bonus feature one might not expect: it can be eaten dry with bare hands without fear of getting one's fingers (overly) sticky or tracking sugar-coating all over the house afterwards (I am glaring at you, Cinnamon Toast Crunch). But how healthy is Golden Grahams, you ask. Will my child be safe eating Golden Grahams? I'm really not the guy to ask. I will tell you right now that I am not concerned with this information, nor is it my job to type up all the fine print on the side of the box regarding how many calories each serving contains and how many vitamins are present in each cereal to include it in my review. All you need to know is that Golden Grahams is a healthy option and details regarding potential lethal dosage exist at the General Mills website. The only other area of interest to cereal eaters I have yet to cover is the state of the milk left over after complete annihilation of every Graham in the bowl. Unfortunately, it's also the only area in which this cereal is lacking. The leftover milk is quite average and definitely nothing to get worked up about. However, the fact remains: Golden Grahams is a hell of a breakfast cereal, so go classic. Go Golden Grahams. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Simple RECIPE,5,"Perhaps some of you are like I was... wanting to take advantage of the health benefits of oatmeal, but uncertain how to prepare it so that you and your family will actually eat it. After experimenting a bit, and reading lots of recipes, I've come up with a simple, yet tasty way to prepare McCANN's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal. Give it a try, and you may decide that oatmeal can be a healthy and delicious addition to your breakfast menu. Recipe: - Start by bringing 3 cups of water to a boil (about 3-4 minutes in the microwave). - In a medium saucepot, melt 1 tablespoon of butter then add 1 cup of oats. Toast the oats on medium heat for about 3 minutes. - Add the boiling water to the toasted oats and simmer for 25 minutes. Don't stir. It should get to a soft bubbling simmer. If it boils to hard, you stove is set too hot, so turn it down or it will burn. - Add 1 cup of milk (or can do with a mix of milk and buttermilk). - Cook an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Makes 4-5 good size servings with excellent texture and consistency. It thickens once it sits a little bit. You can increase or decrease the milk to adjust the consistency as desired. You can also save it for up to a week in the refrigerator without much difference in taste. Just store in small sealed bowls. Each can of McCANNs oatmeal makes about 16-20 servings. Everyone likes to top and sweeten their oatmeal differently (sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, raisins, etc.). Only add the toppings when you're ready to eat it, not before storing in the refrigerator. For my serving, I like to add 2 tsp of brown sugar, 2 tsp of maple syrup, a sprinkle of cinnamon, about 1/2 tbsp of butter, and then top with chopped pecans. I know it's not particularly healthy, but it is very tasty. Hope you enjoy! Please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

You also get a good mix of colors and flavors. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a ""chocolate-type candy"" where you'd have to worry about allergies. They arrived at my home fresh and delicious. Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some. But, I do recommend the five pound bag over the pack of twelve. You get approximately a pound and a half more in the five pound bag for about .50 more! Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound! And these are the same exact bears, but you don't have to worry if everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag! That's a big plus for me! I definitely recommend these gummi bears, they are a sweet and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal! I will definitely be ordering more and different kinds.

 Tastes great for what it is,5,"I have relied on these cake mixes for a few years and find them to be handy and to taste fine. As with most sugar free products they taste great if you have not been eating sugar, but taste a little off if you switch straight from eating full sugar/fat desserts. The cake mixes only require water to make. A teaspoon of real vanilla or almond extract improves the flavor. I like to make the chocolate cake with iced coffee. Then rather than use sugar free frosting (ugggh!) I sprinkle the top with either unsweetened cocoa or with chopped coffee beans. The bitterness of the cocoa and the coffee beans enhances the sweetness of the cake. These mixes make a very thin eight-inch layer. My local grocery store sells the mixes for $2.79 and rarely has flavors other than chocolate or yellow so the price and variety offered here is wonderful news. …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Yummy!,5,"For those that are looking for the ingredient list check out the Betty Crocker website - they have a great gluten free section for the new products. When mixing the ingredients don't be alarmed that the batter is very crumbly. We used a round ice cream scoop when putting on the baking sheet - worked fabulously! The result is a buttery, chewy delicious cookie! My daughter made them with her friend and her friend brought some home to share with her family...they had no clue they were gluten free. I would buy this over and over again! …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 this is pork gelatin,4,"This brand was highly recommended to me for quality. Just beware that this is PORCINE gelatin. If you want the beef gelatin you have to buy the KOSHER one, which Superstore also has at about the same price. I didn't realize all this before ordering. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Good formula and a great deal,5,"My two sons have both been brought up on Nestle Good Start with DHA & ARA. After the first three types of formula made my first son throw up all the time (Similac, Enfamil, and Similac Lactose-free), our doctor suggested Good Start and we've had much better luck. There must be something to that whole ""Comfort Proteins"" label on the can. As for people complaining about the price, I don't know how they do their math. We've bought cans of this stuff from Wal-Mart and Target, and Superstore is cheaper by dollars, not cents. Here are my tips: 1: You love Superstore, so sign up for Superstore Prime. You'll get the formula in two days without paying shipping. This eliminates people's claims that shipping makes it more expensive than Wal Mart and people's complaints that it takes four months (which is a problem with Superstore Grocery early in its genesis, not a problem with the formula itself). 2: Use the Grocery3 or other $10 off promo code while you can. This, combined with Superstore Prime's free two-day shipping, makes the cost of each can of formula less than $22 with no sales tax. Maybe if you live in Oregon and don't have sales tax and your local Target or Wal Mart for a goof drops the price to lower than $22 and you happen to live next door to Wal Mart and don't have to drive there, wait in line, and drive home, you can beat the price. In summary, this is good formula that lives up to its claim about being easier on babies' stomachs, and if you work the system, it's cheaper to have it delivered to your doorstep than to go fight the crowds at your local superstore. …",20 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Great tea for weight loss! One of the ONLY ones I have found that actually works!,5,"Wonderful tea, it really supresses the appetite! I love the packaging also. I would highly recommend as a weight loss tea as I have tried many out there that claim to be such and are not. This one has the garcinia that actually works to supress the appetite. It is great tasting also as I have tasted many that I could not stand. …",30 out of 32 users found this review helpful

" A Healthy version of Russian Roulette, with a flamethrower",4,"First off, this is a great snack. Loaded with protein, it's a real food (not overly processed), not sugared up, not overloaded with sodium, with relatively few calories for how filling it is -- you don't feel guilty reaching for it. They also taste good, with the one major caveat. The only problem is, like every other review states, the uneven distribution of Wasabi. So, you can go a few handfuls without feeling more than a tingle, and then you grab that one bean. I literally mean ONE bean too, because that's all it takes to get the party started. You won't recognize this one bean from the outside because the coating on all of them is invisible. You will only recognize it when it's inside your mouth burning away the top layers of cells - it's the fire bean. You will find this bean, and you most surely will find it, because there are a few special beans in every package. When you find this one bean it is like a quart of drano down the gullet. That sinus clearing wave of fire that only Wasabi brings. I'm a grown man, appropriately detached from my emotions, and the fire bean has brought me to the point of tears. A withering sobbing wreck, and this is only a slight exaggeration. The burn is like a wasabi burn or Asian food in general though, it passes quickly. Then you'll immediately want to go back to the burn bean lottery, pressing your luck, hoping you can withstand the next barrage. …",49 out of 49 users found this review helpful
 Careful!  Dogs can CHOKE and DIE on these!,1,"My 5 month old french bulldog puppy almost died on the first bone tonight. He chewed it down and attempted to swallow a piece that was too big to go down his throat. When he began gagging and throwing up I had to stick my hand down his throat to push the lodged bone into his stomach. VERY scary and upset me greatly. I do NOT recommend these bones. There is even a choking warning on the back in small writing. Keep your pet safe and purchase MUCH BIGGER bones for them, and take away anything too small so they cannot choke or get hurt. …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful
