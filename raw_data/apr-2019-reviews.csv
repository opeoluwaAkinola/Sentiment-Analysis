" Not what it's made out to be, unfortunately",1,"I purchased this soda from my local health food store, thinking that because it came from a health food store and claimed to be 'natural', that it didn't use GMO ingredients (yes, I know, I was naive, lol) . After reading some of the comments here, especially the one about the ingredients not being as advertised by the company, I decided to do some research. I ended up emailing the company and asking them why they used erythritol and where their erythritol source came from. The response that I received appears below. I don't appreciate marketing that is designed to mislead consumers by throwing the word 'natural' around like this product does. I have enough labels to sift through to try to remove GMO from my diet. Figured I'd pass the info on. Hi Joanna, Erythritol is 100% natural. It occurs naturally in grapes, melons, pears, corn to name a few sources. It is made through a fermentation process like yeast. Erythritol has no calories and no effect on blood sugar levels. The reason we blend stevia (hundreds of time sweeter than sugar) with erythritol (only 70% the sweetness of sugar) is because the combination yields a natural sweetness that tastes like sugar. Using either sweetener alone would not please the palate like Zevia does. ------------------ Hi Joanna, Zevia is always considering ingredients that are safe for personal safety and health and that of our environments. Our erythritol is not certified Organic by the USDA and is not certified GMO-Free and is made from corn. Zevia does seek out suppliers of GMO-free ingredients when they are available in the market and when it is a viable alternative, but we cannot make the claim that all of our ingredients are GMO-free. We promise that we will continue to explore ingredient alternatives when available and will always choose to do right by our customer and the environment. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Simply delicious flavor!,5,"I have been using butter ghee for cooking purposes, and found this product on Superstore. The color is much darker than the grocery store product I had been using, and this product has a richer flavor as well. I have been buying grassfed butter online as well, and it's clear there is a flavor difference. I would recommend this product and will continue to buy it for cooking. Butter is good for bread, ghee is better for cooking, and grass-fed is the best! …",29 out of 29 users found this review helpful
 Not from the Pacific Coast,3,"I'm sure that the fruit and nuts are just fine. But, if for example, you want to buy fruit and nuts that were grown in the Golden State instead of just packed there, you should know that on the label on the back it says that it's from Argentina, another country I've forgotten, and the USA.

 Great coffee but....,3,This is a great coffee nice and bold and not to bitter and a great cost (with the monthly subscription). Here is the problem why it doesn't get 5 stars for me. I have had some boxes that the edge of the pod gets sealed in between the two layers of the wrapper making imposable to get the pod out of the wrapper with out tearing the pod and making it useless. I have had as many as 10 out of 18 in a box do this also I have had some boxes that are perfect. I think with a little more quality control Melitta would have a 5 star product here. …,19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Nutiva Coconut oil,5,"There is absolutely nothing better in the world for your health then pure, virgin coconut oil. Research it and when you buy, buy it HERE. The cost with free shipping is the BEST in the world. Superstore has a lot to offer and has never disappointed me. The benefits of this oil are endless. Your skin, hair, cholestrol, blood pressure, liver & kidneys will all benefit from having 3 tablespoons per day. It also helps you lose weight as it stasbilizes your metabolism! You can also use this as a moisterizer on your skin directly. Skin rashes, psoriasis, excema (SP), will all be greatly and naturally treatd with this.

" I hate coconuts, but I love this!",5,"I'm not one to write reviews, only when I love / hate the product and for one thing, I HATE coconuts. However, I first tried the passion fruit flavored Zico and thought, this doesn't taste like coconuts at all! I loved the taste and soon got addicted to how good I felt post workouts. I tried the other mango flavor, and liked it too, so thought I'd venture to the natural coconut one. To my surprise, it wasn't what I remembered coconuts tasted like, in fact, it was more refreshing than the other flavors! I love the new bottle Zico has come out with, it makes drinking and cooling Zico so much easier. The Lime and Pomberry additions are amazing! The bottles make traveling with it easier, and now, I don't have to drink in one sitting. Best time to drink a Zico though is after a hard night of partying. I don't know what it is, but after a night of drinking, I always reach for a Zico and the next morning, its as if nothing happened the night before. I'm a firm believer in the natural remedies of coconuts now, post workout, post drinking, post anything where you exert energy. I still won't eat a real coconut, but I will drink a Zico. I've tried the other brands out there and cannot stomach it, but for some reason, love Zico. …",6 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Great salt,5,"This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a ""rounded"" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

" Liquid Jade is fairly good,  but high cost",3,"This morning I taste-tested 3 top-rated Matcha green teas that I recently purchased on Superstore. 1. Serendipi Tea matcha culinary grade organic green tea from Japan, 4 oz. costs $17.43 (result: *****) 2. Tea Zone matcha green tea powder, 8 oz. costs $16.99 (Superstore sells this as `Matcha Green Tea Powder By Malden Tea', but my black foil packaging label says it's made by Tea Zone) (result: ****) 3. Liquid Jade powdered matcha green tea 100% organic, 3 oz. Cost $18.46 (result: ***) Recipe: I made 3 different cups of `green tea latte' with the following method: 1 tsp tea powder, mixed with filtered water into a smooth paste, added to 1/3 cup hot soymilk + 1/3 cup boiling water + 1 tsp raw agave nectar, frothed into a Latte-style tea with hand-pump device. NOTE: I am a scientist. Each cup was clearly labeled. I tasted the teas side-by-side, taking 3 sips of each before proceeding to next sample. I tasted in random order until all 3 cups were consumed. Total time: 15 minutes. I took lots of notes and drew graphs etc. Result: Serendipi Tea (5+ stars) won for sweet smooth flavor, amazing long lasting froth bubbles, and the fact it's organic!! Cost: $4.30/oz but worth it. Note on the packaging: For those reviewers complaining of the green tea powder leaking, I have to point out that it's hand packed, with a note explaining that you must pack it yourself in an airtight and light-blocking container. Fine with me, since this is the best tea I've found, and the act of packing it myself is itself a ZEN moment in which I feel a connection to the individual soul who packed the brown bag by hand just for me. You decide. Tea Zone (Malden Tea) (4+ stars) came in second for a very nice flavor, but the frothy bubbles popped sooner than the Serendipi Tea, making for a lower rating, and plus, it isn't organic. But it gets extra points for its low cost: $2.12/oz (can't beat this price for a daily tea). Liquid Jade (3 stars) was an O.K. tea, ever-so-slightly more bitter than the other two I taste tested, and almost a chalky feeling (perhaps it was ground into larger particles than the other teas). Yes it's organic, always a plus, but at a cost of $6.15/oz, no way will I buy this again when I can get TeaZone 4 stars for a third this cost, and Serendipi Tea 5 stars for significantly less money as well. 'Au revoir' Liquid Jade (though I do love your container and I'll save it.) …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Looks like a winner,5,"I'm a serious label-reader, even more so for my cat than for myself, so before I ordered Petite Cuisine, I went to their website to see what they had to say for themselves. I was pleased to read that they use no wheat gluten in their food, nor meat by-products; neither belongs in pet food. They also make a point of saying that they use no products from China. It's a reassurance I appreciate in the light of the recent spate of pet deaths linked to product coming out of China. What they do use was also reassuring. White meat chicken, veggies, olive or soybean oils, vitamins and minerals. The sesame chicken does contain rice which isn't something that should necessarily be fed often, but it's a minor consideration. While it's never said that the ingredients are ""human grade"" they are listed as safe for humans to eat. I don't know about anyone else but I wouldn't want to feed my pets anything that wasn't safe for me to eat. The carton arrived and was marked as ""Product of Thailand"" which was a bit of a surprise since no mention of Thailand appears on their site. They are, however, quick to point out that no child labor is used in production of any of the food. (It's also listed as ""dolphin safe."" This is a pretty politically correct company.) Of course the proof of the pudding, or in this case, the cat food, is the eating. My response as I opened the cans was the the sesame chicken looked and smelled very tempting. The chicken pot pie, not so much. It smells wonderful, but is very watery. Again, this is a minor consideration. If my cat likes it, that's the important thing. He's a picky boy, in part because he can't eat beef or lamb, so he's limited to poultry and certain types of fish. He doesn't tend to like the souped-up, holistic foods that add things like rosemary and acai and all those things which humans so cheerfully add to their own foods. But this stuff is pretty basic, and, well let's just say, he doesn't hate it. I can probably add it to the rotation without causing much consternation, and know that he's getting a quality meal. Your mileage -- or your cat's -- may vary, of course. Cats are perverse little beasts, and you just never know what they're going to take violent dislike to. I can't tell you if your cat will like this food or not, but I can tell you that it looks like quality product made by people who have high standards. Yes, it's pricey, but if you feel, as I do, that your cat deserves the consideration you'd give to any member of the family, you probably won't balk at the cost. The rest is up to your cat. …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Superstore should be ashamed to even carry this.,1,"""2% Kopi Luwak"" That's the key part in the description of this fake Kopi Luwak coffee. For my money, 2% might as well be 0%. Basically they have taken ordinary coffee beans, which may or may not be good beans to begin with, and put in 00.16 ounces of Kopi Luwak beans per pound. That means this bag contains about 00.30 ounces of Kopi Luwak as it's a 200 gram bag. My point? Drinking a cup of this is not drinking a cup of Kopi Luwak, but just a very expensive cup of normal coffee, period. Superstore should be ashamed to be selling this. Enjoy your fake Kopi Luwak coffee. …",79 out of 79 users found this review helpful

 Canned Alaskan Pink Salmon,5,"Can't beat the price. No sales tax and no shipping is awesome! And the best part is just try finding low-sodium Salmon (or any other products) at your regular grocery store and if you can then you usually pay a premium for it. I am on the low-sodium DASH type diet and plan on buying this product again in the near future. Oh yeah! It is very delicious especially with a splash of Tabasco, right out of the can or make a nice Salmon salad out of it! I am getting hungry just thinking about it right now. :^) Go Superstore! Get some more low-sodium and NO-SALT/SODIUM products and you will definitely be getting a lot more business.

 Best PB Ever!,5,"I became addicted to this stuff shortly after my first child was born. Between nursing and not sleeping, I ate A LOT of peanut butter sandwiches in those months. I have tried almost every 'natural' brand out there - I won't eat anything hydrogenated or containing HFCS. Trader Joe's flax PB is pretty good. But then I discovered this stuff and have not switched back. Perfect crunch and just the right amount of sweetness to make it yummy, but not what I would call sweet (and I don't like overly sweet things as a rule). The only minor downer is that the jars from Superstore arrive with the PB separated a bit. This is no big deal for Natural PB veterans, but it something that you don't find when you buy this in the store. You have to assiduously stir it up or you'll get to the end of the jar with something closer to modeling clay. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Beware new formula!,1,"Be very aware that the new formula ALS is not agreeing with a lot of dogs. I have one of these dogs and no amount of transitioning improved the diarrhea, vomiting, and hot spots. There are many, many complaints on the web by people with dogs having the same symptoms that finally stopped upon changing to another food. Canidae made major changes to their ALS formulas and did nothing to alert the public until they had to (their web site only). There is still nothing on the bags to make people aware of the changes except a new ingredient list. Do your homework before buying this dog food.

" Organic, non-GMO & delicious butter with a high smoke point!",5,"This was the first Ghee or clarified butter I'd ever tried, to my knowledge, and I have to say it's the most amazing stuff to cook with. I saute a large batch fresh organic vegetables in it every week, using my large cast iron skillet, and the flavor it imparts is stupendous! Just a touch of celtic sea salt and a few tablespoons of this make the veggies something my whole family craves. Bonus: it's a healthy oil for us! You can also use some on a spoon as a chaser to fermented cod liver oil to get the maximum benefits. Look up the work of Weston A. Price for more information on that preventative, but even if you don't, you'll absolutely love this for cooking and in recipes. I also LOVE that it doesn't have to be refrigerated, so it sits in the cabinet, happily, with the salt and olive oil, not taking up precious refrigerator space. It's delicious, and it's NON-GMO!! In this day & age, where so much GMO corn, soy, canola & other foods are genetically modified, and I'm trying to outrun them, this is such a relief to find. No hormones, no antibiotics & no GMOS!

 New formula,1,"My dogs have been on Canidae for the past several years and even the picky dog who has lost over half her teeth loved it. However, I recently bought a new bag of Canidae. The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula. I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it. The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything. I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat. NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags. Their response: ********* Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas. ********* I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it. And when they say they are getting positive feedback from our customers that are *actually* feeding the new formula, are they trying to imply that I only pretended to feed the new food?!?! …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 I cannot say enough good things about this stuff,5,"I first heard about steel cut oats on the Oprah show about its health benefits. First of all I DO NOT like regular oatmeal like you buy in the grocery store. I don't like the slimy texture. But I figured I'd try steel cut oats and I'm glad I did. They are delicous and very good for you! The warm nutty aroma when they are cooking is very appetizing. I add a little bit of sugar or splenda and some cinnimon, it tastes fantastic! I also sometimes skip the cinnimon and add a tablespoon of granola and/or some dried berries. Excellent healthy breakfast. Normally these take about 30 minutes to cook on the stovetop. I found a way to cut the cooking time in half. Take 1/3 cup of oats, and 1 1/3 cup of water and put it in a large microwavable bowl. Cook in the microwave on High for 5 minutes, stir, then another 5 minutes, then stir again, and then cook about another 2-3 minutes until the texture is just the way you like it. For those of you who are asking what the difference is between regular oatmeal and steel cut oatmeal: -Steel-Cut Oats are whole grain groats (the inner portion of the oat kernel) which have been cut into two or three pieces using steel discs. Golden in color and resembling mini rice particles, they are as nature intended - nothing added and nothing taken out. -Rolled oats are flake oats that have been steamed, rolled, re-steamed and toasted. Due to all of this additional processing they have lost some of their natural taste, goodness and texture. …",278 out of 284 users found this review helpful

" So far, decent table wine for the price",4,"Having never made wine before, we decided to give it a try, mainly because of the price of this kit. Once we purchased the wine-making equipment (fermenter, carboy, siphons, air locks, hydrometer, etc) from a home-brew supply company, we were ready to make this wine. We used Midwest Homebrewing and Winemaking Supply ([...]) for the equipment package. They have a starter kit that is reasonably priced. I would also recommend purchasing a wine thief (to take samples with) and a container to hold your samples in when testing them, in addition to an auto siphon and maybe some oak chips for this kit. All in all, we spent about $60 on the equipment we needed to use this wine kit. Having read reviews about this wine-kit company's wines being ""watery"" I decided to make 5 gallons instead of 6. Later, I read that this can be VERY tricky with kits because they are specifically tailored for that particular volume of wine. Maybe I got lucky, but our batch came out pretty good. I also added some extra tannin, a little citric acid and I soaked some oak chips in it during the final phase. I was careful to keep everything sterile (with the sterilizer that came with my equipment package- never use bleach or other household chemicals on wine equipment) and I also paid attention to the fermentation temperature, having read that two of the most important things in home winemaking are sterilization and temperature. I just bottled 23 bottles of this wine a couple of days ago and we drank the 1/2 bottle that was left over. It tastes like an inexpensive table wine you'd get in a restaurant in Italy or France. Nothing special, so far. However, I've read that even a few months of aging in the bottle can do wonders for these kit wines so I'm eager to see how it tastes later this year. As of bottling it was clear (no haze) and had a nice, light raspberry color to it. It was semi-dry with lots of fruit undertones; decent legs and an okay nose. There was a faint hint of oak, probably from the chips, which soaked in the carboy for about 5 days before bottling. All-in-all, I've paid more for wine that wasn't as good. I've already started my second batch (a Vinter's Reserve kit purchased locally) and today I started a small batch made from organic grape juice purchased at the grocery store (we'll see what happens there). Warning, wine making can become addictive- it's one part science, one part art. I'd recommend this kit to a beginner who doesn't want to invest the $100 in a higher-end kit.

Those two liquids are the foundation for almost all recipes, and are used in some quantity in every dish. I do a considerable amount of Japanese cooking, and running out of mirin sends me into panic mode and heading out to the store. Don't be fooled into thinking that ""teriyaki sauce"" has anything with Japanese cuisine. Purely an American invention, true teriyaki cooking is a combination of mirin and soy sauce, based on the meat or vegetables which are then slowly cooked, rotating sides until they become a delicious brown sticky mess. It is sooo much better than the fast food restaurants try to pass off as ""Japanese teriyaki"". When it comes to brands, it is hard to go wrong with Kikkoman. For both mirin and soy sauce, they put out a consistently good product that you can count on to enhance your cooking. There are probably more refined and expensive brands out there, but Kikkoman does me just fine, as it does for the millions of Japanese households where it sees daily use. As a sweetened wine, mirin adds flavor as well as nutrients to a dish, and can even be used as a sugar substitute in some recipes for those trying to escape from refined white sugar. Check out Foods That Heal for an in-depth discussion on mirin's health benefits and uses. …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 A bit unbelievable really....,5,"UPDATE: It's been quite a qhile since I ordered my first box of Skin Detox tea, and have ordered it periodically since. I have the awful habit of using skin detox tea until my skin looks great, then not buying the tea for a while until I notice my skin becoming worse. I have to say, that this tea has helped my skin quality in general mroe than any product that I have used. I have at times applied the tea topically as well for stronger effects, but it isn't neccessary for the tea to work. I've decided that i am going to actualyl keep myself in a constant supply of the tea, and drink it each day, as opposed to only after bad breakouts, to take a more proactive rather than reactive approach. Ad for the taste, I actually like it now. it took getting used to, but I find the taste calming and comforting now, as opposed to tolerable before. Anyway, if you have any hesitation whatsoever about tryig this tea for your skin, buy a box at the grocery store to try it out. I can almost guarantee that with regular use, though, your skin will improve. PRIOR REVIEW: My first review, couldnt help myself! I heard some good things about this tea from a friend and decided that it couldnt hurt to order, as i am an avid tea-drinker anyway. Right before the tea arrived I began a horrendous breakout, the worst that I had had in years even. The entire left side of my face was covered in acne, perhaps a reaction from a new face-wash, that i since have been scared to touch! Well a few days following the breakout the tea arrived. I figured there was no better situation really than this to try the tea so over the course of two weeks, besides general rinsing in the shower i have used no face wash, no creams or ointments, nothing. And my acne is almost gone! nothing new has popped up and everything that had been there is almost completely gone, i even notice acne scars fading if possible. my ance is literally drying up, as if i was using some sort of heavy cleanser or astringent, it is quite ridiculous. I am already looking at my budget to see if i have enough to order another batch. I used about 3 bags a day, one cup about midday with two tea bags, and one before bed with a single bag. The tea has a flavor that takes getting used to, both strong and weak at the same time, hard to explain. i don't use sugar so i don't know how it tastes with anything added. either way, it cant hurt so try it, i say! …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Best quality agave currently available,5,"Over the years I've done bulk buying for a housing cooperative and have dealt with wholesome sweeteners before - they sell everything from sucanat to organic corn syrup (blech). A lot of the other agave stuff on the market right now is simply from resellers trying to make a buck moving high margin natural foods products - this stuff is from a company that specializes in selling sweeteners and has a reputation for quality. You can't really beat it. Uses: This stuff is perfect for tea - just a little bit takes the bitter edge off most black / green teas without overwhelming the flavor - and for making raw sweets. A lot of people like to use this stuff for baking, but I find it a bit expensive for this use - honey is cheaper and more readily available. This stuff is really healthy, but has to travel a lot of miles and uses a lot of packaging where both honey and maple syrup can be found locally in gallon jugs depending on where you live. Our coop actually buys honey in 60lb jugs :) Note: Different companies advertise widely ranging glycemic index values for their agave syrups - enough so to make your head spin at how they could be so widely different for what appears to be the same product. Wholesome Sweeteners advertises 39 or less on their site, which is believable, where some companies advertise values as low as 21 with no analysis to back their claims up. To give you an idea of how this stuff compares glycemic index wise both honey & maple syrup have glycemic indexes around 55, corn syrup's is around 100, and white sugar's is around 110(!). …",58 out of 59 users found this review helpful

 poor service from this company,1,"When I purchased this sauce to aid in my Atkins diet, it was shown CLEARLY to be a 6 pack.

They said Superstore writes the listing (Lies) and to contact them. I called Superstore, they said no, they couldn't possibly be responsible for the misprint on the ad, as they sell millions oof products for tens of thousands of companies, and each company writes their own ads for their own products. (Truth) and that I should make every attempt to resolve the conflict with the seller. After several more ""going nowhere"" calls with the supplier, they said the only way they would do anything is to submit it for resolution with Superstore, and I'd probably get my money partially refunded. Superstore ended refunding all of my purchase price and shipping. I can't wait to never buy from All Star Health , ever, ever again. I hope my review inspires you to look elsewhere as well.

 How Could You Be So Bold,5,"After FINALLY purchasing best coffee maker I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Superstore, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold. Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold. What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's. There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Superstore. Wake up people, and add this to your cart.

 A major improvement in menopausal symptoms,5,"I tried this product after researching menopausal heart palpitations and internal tremors on www.power-surge . The relief was immediate!

No more nightmares (brought on by hormone fluctuations). No more ""internal earthquakes"" or buggy-crawling sensations on my skin. Less anxiety (formerly triggered by hormonal changes). No more weak nails. Monthly acid reflux greatly reduced, sometimes none at all. Greatly reduced frequency of colds, flus and sinusitus. I chose the Calm with Calcium since I am dairy allergic. My body assimilates it well, much better than calcium & magnesium pills, which had little to no effect on the above-mentioned problems (in ANY ratio). Overall, I feel much calmer & more energetic.

" Say it once, say it twice, third time's the charm!",5,"When this movie first came out about fifteen years ago, my father owned a video store and every Wednesday night was ""Beetlejuice"" night. I'm older now, obviously, but I still cannot get enough of this movie. <p>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play Adam and Barbara Maitland, two Connecticut yuppies who die prematurely in a car wreck. Within a couple weeks, their home is overrun by an ultra-trendy New York City family, Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter, Lydia (played respectively by Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder). Adam and Barbara want their house back, and attempt to scare the Deetz's out of the house by wearing sheets and even by possessing them over dinner, making them sing and dance to Harry Belafonte's ""Day O."" Those attempts fail and enter Michael Keaton as Betelguese, ""the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist."" The movie is dark without being scary and funny without being ridiculous. <p>In my opinion, one of the real gems in this film is the late Sylvia Sidney as Juno, Your Case Worker. Sidney was pushing eighty when this film was made, but turns in a great performance as the embittered equivalent of an afterlife social worker. Love how the smoke from her ever-present cigarette comes out of the slit in her throat. <p>If you've never seen this movie, see it. If you have seen it but don't own it on DVD, get it.

 Loosen up and Enjoy Life!,5,"I wonder if the average person knows how difficult it is for someone with severe food allergies to find packaged preprepared foods they can safely eat?

Ingesting even tiny amounts cause life threatening reactions. As a result I cook most of my own meals from scratch, don't often risk eating out and take ""safe"" food with me when I travel. Unfortunately soy and gluten seem to be the foundation of most western foods. So it's really REALLY hard to find foods that don't contain at least one of these ingredients. So having an option like ""Enjoy Life"" foods is wonderful. Yes they're small and yes they're rich and calorie laden ... but they taste good and ARE SAFE for ANYONE to eat.

 The DIShonest Kitchen lies and rips you off- feed a real raw diet for much less,1,"The meat in THK dehydrated diets is not raw. It it would not be a human grade food if the meat were actually raw. The manufacturer told me that the meat in their food is ""dehydrated"" at a temperature that actually cooks the meat and that is how it is able to be labeled human grade. If this is the case, why use the word ""Raw"" over and over again in the advertising and ingredient list. It's not raw and it's not as good as raw. Secondly, and perhaps just as important, is that the consumer is paying for things their pet can't digest. The consumer pays for the very expensive dehydration process for VEGETABLES and other things that carnivores cannot digest and do not need. The only way to get the nutrients out of vegetables, fruits and seeds, and into a dog's system is to puree the vegetables and break down the cellulose or to COOK them. From I can tell, neither of these things are done to the vegetables. Ironically, the part of the THK diet that shouldn't be raw is, and the meat, which should be raw, isn't. The fact that a great deal of the honest kitchen diets are not digested is pretty obvious to people who feed it to their dogs. You can clearly see the celery, bananas, and other whole chunks of vegetable/fruit that come out in the stool. If you happen to take a look at the stool after a bit of rain has washed away the smooshy parts, you will see mounds of undigested vegetable matter that seem to equal 80% of the total volume. So not only are you feeding something that isn't being digested, but you are feeding lots of it. Why would you pay for something that is completely wasted? I know several dogs who are or were on THK who presented with hot spots, fleas, allergies, and other chronic conditions that didn't exist when they were on raw diets. I have seen it over, and over again. After seeing what I've seen, I could never go back to feeding a dehydrated diet from this manufacturer. I do see some promise in the Ziwi Peak line and Stella and Chewy's, so you might want to try those out and stop paying for chunky veggies your dog can't digest. It is far less expensive to feed a raw diet of human grade meats and bone from your grocery store. You would probably pay 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of THK diets. You would even save money if you went with a pre-packaged frozen raw diet such as Primal or Nature's Variety. I know a lot of people feed THK because they are afraid to feed real raw meat, but I pray that will change. THK is making millions, and for that they should be commended. They shed blood, sweat, and tears to create a market for their food and I know that was hard work. But they are/were doing it dishonestly. On top of that, they have the gall to name themselves honest. Yikes. To THK, If you care to tell us exactly what temperatures or radiation your meat is exposed to prior to packaging, and issue a statement that states your finished product contains non-irradiated, raw meat, I'll be happy to edit my review. Since meat begins to undergo chemical changes at 120°F and litterally cooks at 140°F, I hope you can supply proof that your product is processed at temperatures below these and is not irradiated. …",13 out of 41 users found this review helpful

 No Maltodextrin!!!,5,"This product is the best meal replacement drink I have seen to date. I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't. The main difference between this meal replacement and other meal replacement products I've seen is in the carbohydrates they provide. Most other meal replacements I've seen either use sugars or maltodextrin as their main carbohydrate. The problem with this is that they have a high glycemic index. This means that when you eat them, your blood sugar rapidly rises and your body responds by making a lot of insulin. Then in a very short time, your blood sugar is low and you have no energy and are hungry again. This product is low sugar and no maltodextrin which is great. Hopefully it has a low glycemic index. The oil blend is this product looks to be good. They don't report the exact percentages of omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids but they do contain omega fatty acids. As for the protein, it's a blended protein that's 40 grams per serving. In my opinion, the taste of these products is great, but that's only an opinion. Concerning the nutritional value of this product, everything I've said here is easy to validate with a little research. The only downfall of this product is the cost. It's a lot cheaper to just blend protein powder, oatmeal and Udo's oil in a blender, but that obviously isn't nearly as convienent.

" Yummy, weird, salty, and high in fat... but I like them!",3,"I would give these 3 and 1/2 stars if I could. Now that I have tried these I see why there are so many ""mixed"" reviews. To start: they are NOT ""healthy"". Yes, they are low in carbs, but for the total calories from fat (60 out of 75) - the percentage is WAY too high. That means the calories are 80% from fat. Yes, I realize they are made of cheese, which is mostly fat, but they are not something I want to be eating all day every day. (Kind of like the 100-calorie pack treats that are portion controlled, but not so ""healthy"" either.) Plus, they are high in sodium like most other people have pointed out. However, they are very low in carbs (1 gram) and high in protein (5 grams). I got the ""Classic White Cheddar Cheese"". Keep in mind that white cheddar is one of my all-time favorite cheeses. The texture is crunchy - similar to a rice cake (a little denser). The one thing that I strongly DON'T like, is the weird, greasy, oily feeling it leaves on my teeth. But maybe that is just me. But the flavor is fine. The packaging states the following: 1 bag (0.5 oz.) - 14 grams: Calories: 75 Calories from fat: 60 Total fat - 6.5g (10% Daily Value [DV]) Cholesterol - 25mg (8% DV) Sodium - 275mg (12% DV) Total carbs - 1g (0% DV) Protein - 5 g Vitamin A - 5% DV Calcium - 16% DV The size of the bag reminds me of those little pouches of fruit gummies that they make for kids lunches.

One thing I especially like about these chews is that they are made from tiny pieces of rawhide so as they get moist they break up and greatly reduce the danger of choking on a large piece. …,14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Total rip off,1,"I'm surprised no one has noted how much water is in the package and how little fat (only 1.4%). This Weruva flavor, for example, has 85% water (only 15% dry ingredients). Here is what the FDA says on its web site: ""It is especially important to look at the moisture guarantee for canned foods, even when comparing a canned food with another canned. Under AAFCO regulations, the maximum percentage moisture content for a pet food is 78%, except for products labeled as a ""stew,"" ""in sauce,"" ""in gravy,"" or similar terms. The extra water gives the product the qualities needed to have the appropriate texture and fluidity. Some of these exempted products have been found to contain as much as 87.5% moisture. This doesn't sound like much difference until the dry matter contents are compared. For example, a product with a guarantee of 87.5% moisture contains 12.5% dry matter, only half as much as a product with a 75% moisture guarantee (25% dry matter)."" On top of the nutrition problems, Weruva is ripping you off on a cost basis (this is my comment, not the FDA's). Looking at the dry ingredients, Weruba is charging you about $2 per ounce ($1.60 per 0.825 oz dry ingredients in a 5.5 oz can). The top premium cat foods charge about $1 per ounce of dry ingredients. Avoderm is 80 cents per 1 oz dry weight. Science Diet is less than 70 cents per oz dry weight. So Weruva is nearly 3 times the cost for ingredients other than water comparing Science Diet. So if you have a lot of money to waste and don't mind your cats having dry hair and other skin problems from lack of essential fats in the diet, then go for Weruva. Otherwise, wait until they drop their price and increase the fat content. …",17 out of 28 users found this review helpful

There was a study by the Mayo Clinic of patients with CLL [my form of the disease] and there were some statistical data showing benefits for CLL patients who took a green tea extract -- strength not specified by the Mayo Clinic. I ordered this product as soon as I was diagnosed, and found immediate relief from swolen glands, and night sweats. I contacted the manufacturer, using the info on the label, and they have oncologists as consultants. The response to my question: ""how much can I take?"" came back as 3 times daily. Five months later, swelling is minimal, night sweats rare. Doctor says my WBC is stable.... Those results are hard to dispute, in my opinion. Given the info above -- this is a great product, full of good anti-oxidents, but with some minimally proven benefits for CLL patients, like me.

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Results vary for Hot Air Poppers,4,"some good results some bad..., October 16, 2009 By V. Sandy ""V"" (Prescott,AZ) - See all my reviews Superstore Verified Purchase(What's this?) I bought the 12 bottle variety to try out. I just recently started using a hot air popper so wanted to see what varieties worked well. First off. The baby white and baby yellow kernels are just too light for use in a hot air popper. We did pop them at work using a traditional popper and they were fine. The are two varieties that stood out as my favorites for my hot air popper. The first is the Wisconsin White Birch, which popped up big, fluffy and close to zero unpopped or blow out kernels. The second is Savannah Gold, it popped up big, nice volume and again almost zero unpopped or blow out kernels. Two varieties that are close seconds as favorites are: Autumn Blaze Blend (small, crisp, no unpopped kernels but quite a few blow outs) and High Mountain Midnight (some no pops, good volume). There was only one variety that I would not ever use again. The Black Hills had about 4 times the quantity of unpopped kernels as any of the other types, the kernels popped up very small, it was extremely hully and some kernels burnt in the hot air popper. Orchard Blossom, Red River Valley and Harvest Blend types all popped fine in my hot air popper with only a few unpopped kernels. The Blue Heron also popped fine with a few more unpopped kernels than the three mentioned in the sentence before; it was also earthy in taste and popped up small kernels. Savannah Fire had very few close to no pops and was very chewy without being hully. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

I've used MRPs (mostly Met-Rx) for decades and also attest to their benefits.

Sucralose replaced aspartane---which from its invention at Searle was known to damage brain cells---as the no-calorie sweetner of over whelming choice by food packagers.

 Particular Puss Loves this Food!,5,"So, I have a HUGE cat (not fat, just laaarge) who has never had issues with being choosy about cat food until this past year. She'd kind of pick at a food for a week or so, then just completely stop. Getting her to eat consistantly has been a huge battle, and I've been worried because she's been losing weight which is not good on her gigantic Maine **** self. I don't have much money, but finally did the math and figured out that buying cheaper food and then throwing half of it away wasn't saving me anything...invested in the Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken cat food. It came a few days ago, and I think the year of struggling to find something Beatrix will eat is finally over. She LOVES this food. She's taken to lounging by the bowl and casting pitiful looks of longing at me whenever its not on hand! lol She's happy, so I'm happy. And its no lie that this is human quality food. I haven't actually eaten any of it, cause...well...yuck, but it looks like better quality than the chicken you get at KFC! lol Plus, and this is big because I live in a small apartment...there is almost NO odor to it like most wet cat foods...just smells slightly chickeny. I've also noticed that her tummy seems to be bothering her less if the litter and furball issues are a good indicator. Good food = happy cat.

" Yeah, Yeah, miracle drug, but how does it taste and is it worth the price",3,"Yes, Manuka honey is special. It is cultivated only in New Zealand and southeast Australia. It has also been used by some researchers in a clinical trial as a medicinal honey to ameliorate some of the ill effects of cancer treatment. It probably works in some medical indications. But this is not because it has magic powers or that it is vastly different from other honeys. Manuka honey is used as a medicinal honey rather than other honeys because it is very well characterized chemically. That characterization is consistent because Manuka honey comes from only two very similar flowers. This honey is unusually viscous and it has relatively high concentrations of the chemicals that kill bacteria in honey. But, most good honeys are viscous and have antibacterial potency; they are just not as well characterized for medicinal purposes. As far as using it as a folk remedy for all these various conditions? Honey has been used as a folk medicine for centuries and it works for some things. As a toxicologist, I have to say `well maybe it will work for this or that, but we cannot really know if something works medically until we do a clinical trial.' The reported `cures' are possibly real and are probably the result of immune stimulation or antibacterial activity that might occur with any honey. But for most people it is really all about how the honey tastes (unless you are on a clinical trial). I think it tastes rather good. It is floral and complex and full of flavor. Its viscosity means it clings to your hot biscuit better than most and it comes in a fancy jar. But my wife did not like it. It was not clear but rather cloudy like honey that has begun to precipitate out its sugar. But that was not the source of the cloudiness; it was actually due to the presence of honey comb. And the honey tastes of comb, which my wife found a bit objectionable. So why buy this honey. I really cannot think of a reason unless you are trying to impress someone. I have had much better, much clearer honey from a roadside stand in North Carolina, particularly sourwood. And this stuff is terribly expensive. I do not see anything wrong with trying it on your warts but you might try a cheaper honey first. Yeah but there is that impress people thing. …",6 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Could you have a worse name for a candy?,2,"People who take candy seriously are a vulnerable group. So why name a straightforward candy ""nerds""? It seems like you are poking fun at your supporters. Especially for the sour ones (which are I think the best), the conventional thing would be to call them something like ""McGillicutty's"" and have a picture of a scowling Irishman. The candy itself is just going to be sugar, corn syrup, stabilizers and some flavoring--the name is what gives you a sense of what it is. In general, the Wonka lines have been a depressing experience. First, no one should have been so cynical as to use the name ""**** Wonka"" for real candy. It's like Fruit of the Loom having ""Thomas Jefferson"" briefs. And I'll get back to that. But second, the candy has consistently been uninventive, third rate, and with no particular appeal. All it does is drag W.W.'s image into the ground as opposed to it being an inspiration. And as we all know, Wonka is now actually a part of Nestle's. Now as someone previously in the candy business, I have to say that Nestle's main-line and high-quality line products in the candy/chocolate world are pretty good. But as a company, Nestle is a nightmare--poisoning pets, starving babies. If Nestle owned the real **** Wonka factory, the Oompa-Loompas would turn out to be slaves. I just can't understand a world in which Nestle owns the right to put out low grade candy and call it **** Wonka. **** Wonka represented the dream of doing good, being a child, and being honest. That was why Charlie got the factory--because he precisely wasn't the kind of guy who would go far in Nestle's. I feel like in this product, Nestle is basically saying to Charlie, ""you're a nerd! Maybe you can work in the tech department programming the payroll computers! But you sure as heck can't run the factory and we're not interested in any of your spacey ideas!"" And one last thing--if you're my age, you've probably had to listen, more than you wanted to, to the song ""Nurds"" (the spelling was ""charmingly"" wrong) by the Roches. Now if there's one thing you don't want associated with your candy product, it's roaches. Animal contamination is always a real threat, and it's often not taken seriously enough. So, Nestle, when you were done with your ethically-dubious activities in the third world, you somehow chose a name for a candy that would both spit in the face of Charlie Bucket and make the consumer queasy.

Grains such as rice, wheat, corn and gluten are present in a large majority of pet foods available on the market. Manufacturers like to insert grain into pet food to their reduce cost and create inexpensive calories. Grain causes alkaline urine in both cats and dogs. Alkaline urine leads to crystals and bladder stones and develops when an animal eats pet food with grains and fillers (high carb diet). Our pets need only meat, organs and water for proper nutrition and you are not ""spoiling"" your pet by feeding them an all wet food diet. Kidney failure is one of the most common diseases in cats and I have learned that I'm putting unnecessary strain my cat's kidneys by feeding him **** food. I purchased 8-10 grain free options for my cat to try out because it's very difficult to get an animal to change their diet once established. Weruva Paw Lickin Chicken was a clear winner with my cat Otis and I highly recommend it. If you think you can't afford a grain free diet for your kitty, please consider the $4,000 I have spent unblocking my cat's urinary tract when crystals formed (emergency procedure). Also, be wary of so-called prescription diets that the vets insist will remedy the problem, they are also full of grains and fillers. …",60 out of 61 users found this review helpful

 Not worth the money,3,"I like to taste many different flavors, and I particularly like this pack because it has the Sour Cream & Onion in it. But, I like to make my money worth more than anything. I paid $17.08 for the whole package and got 36 x 0.81 oz individual pack. My problem was that I couldn't imagine how tiny the individual pack was until I saw it. Most likely, I won't be buying the same pack again unless the price is dropped. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Careful!  Dogs can CHOKE and DIE on these!,1,"My 5 month old french bulldog puppy almost died on the first bone tonight. He chewed it down and attempted to swallow a piece that was too big to go down his throat. When he began gagging and throwing up I had to stick my hand down his throat to push the lodged bone into his stomach. VERY scary and upset me greatly. I do NOT recommend these bones. There is even a choking warning on the back in small writing. Keep your pet safe and purchase MUCH BIGGER bones for them, and take away anything too small so they cannot choke or get hurt. …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 A much better alternative to rice that's for sure!,5,"I try to eat healthy, but it is hard to eat both healthy and cheaply at the same time. I've been looking into ordering Quinoa for years, hopefully the world is finally learning that this is the new super-food, and thankfully I can now finally order it at reasonable prices fairly easily too, so I gave this bag a try. The red because it tastes better according to the critics, and well quite frankly, everything I have read about it is true. It tastes like nuts, is a little crunchy, and the seeds pop when you cook it turning into little snail looking bead sprouts. It is a lot smaller than I expected, but slightly more than doubles in size when you cook it. It was a lot easier to cook than rice which clumps together too easily. Because of the nutty taste I can even eat Quinoa as is, nothing added, something I would never do with rice, and Quinoa because of the high nutrient content makes a completely healthy meal all by itself! Heads up though, WASH IT SEVERAL TIMES IF IT SAYS WASH ON THE BAG. It is not like rice that you wash just to get rid of the dusty powder. If you don't wash Quinoa well before you eat it, then it will taste very acidic like putting a penny in your mouth at first. I really like this stuff and will eat it all until it's gone. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 You have to try it,5,"I tried this based on my mother-in-law's recommendation. This milk powder is nothing like the nonfat milk powder that they sell at most grocery stores. You know what I'm talking about--the kind that tastes like powdered milk. Blech. This one is so rich and delicious. You have to use a lot of it to make a single glass, so it doesn't last very long. This is also great to keep at the office to use in your coffee where it's not always practical to keep a carton of milk. I can't emphasize enough how good this milk is. This may sound strangely random, but when I first made a glass, I noticed my dogs intensely staring at me, hoping I'd give them some. So I did. They absolutely love it, too. They reacted to it as if it were the most delicious thing in the world. They don't even react that way to steak. My husband even noticed and commented it's like doggie crack. I've never seen anything like it. It's also nice that you can control the richness of it by adding more or less powder. I also tried the Nestle Nido milk powder that I got as a sample, and it is just as good. …",47 out of 49 users found this review helpful
 Eh....,3,"I got this as a Christmas gift and I was so excited to open it and start it up. (At this point, I've had it running for 4 months) The instructions and set up are easy. Then I waited until the sprouts started, which didn't take long. Strangely, in the dill seed pod, there was only ONE seed, which... needless to say, produced a very scrawny tuft of dill. That died. The cilantro seemed to have so much promise, seemed to be off to an amazing start. It, too, died. The parsely, which is still alive, is really a useless amount of parsley. I feel guilty when I clip any of it for fear that the plant cannot survive off the tiny amount of leaves that remain. The chives, well.... lets just say that they're lacking in length and girth, and thats never a good sign. HOWEVER! the basil. Oh the basil - both the regular green and the purple, they will NOT stop growing. I am constantly cutting it back because the plants are growing up to the lightbulb and burning on the bulb. I haven't figured out how to use enough of the basil to keep those plants under control. But then again, basil grows like a weed under any circumstances, so it isn't because of the AeroGrow that they are exploding. And the lights, don't even get me started on the lights! They are so insanely bright that you don't need to use any other light source in any room that the AeroGrow is in. I have mine in the kitchen and have resorted to using a curtain to block the glare at night. I have it set to turn off at 10:00 pm, but until that time, its like the surface of the sun in my kitchen - blinding white light. The pump is quite, unless it needs refilling, which is often. I have mine near the sink so its easy to refill the reservoir when I hear the trickeling noise. But that noise is actually a pleasant sound, so really, no complaints about that. But you know what, for the price of running those lights for all those hours every day, and running that pump for 24 hours every day, I am starting to suspect I could just buy organic herbs and produce and still have money left over for a latte. Yes, its a cute conversation piece and yes its nice to have basil on demand (nothing else really grew at all), but really.... it takes up a lot of counter space, its blindingly bright and it is an energy vampire 365 days out of the year. So I give it a solid ""Eh..."" - 3 stars …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 unhealthy stuff!!! --MY EXPERIENCE with this stuff,1,"Initially we were so happy to find this darkest of the dark roasts. I really enjoyed this coffee every morning for over a year. However after extended use, I started becoming very irritable in my day, insomnia, ect. After seeing doctors for PMS and everything else, I just got on the web and searched for ""caffeine sensitivity"". I learned a little something about coffee from a website, ineedcoffee dot com. Dark roasts are terribly unhealthy for you! Dark Roasts break down the sugar and oils and burn the coffee bean to a crisp and you are left with ash material. Not many people can tolerate this and will experience unpleasant side effects which lead you to believe your falling apart when really it's an adversion to the dark roasted beans. It only took one cup in the morning to affect my overall health. So as much as I enjoy this super dark roasted coffee, I must make the switch to the light roast. At least now, I am able to determine if it is a quality coffee bean or not because it is not charcoal. …",5 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 HFAN higher in created Fructose than HFCS,1,"I had used THIS product for over 2 years. During that time I gained 20 pounds although I was eating a healthy diet (besides adding this agave nectar). I gained the weight mostly in my stomach. My doctor and I were at a loss as to what was causing the weight gain. My cholesterol and triglycerides went up as well as my liver enzymes. A friend told me that this product was made essentially the same way HFCS is made. I didn't want to believe him! I investigated several sources and found that I had been duped about this product. I threw an unopened case (6 bottles) in the garbage. Since then, March 3, 2010, I have lost 10 of the pounds gained (thankfully from my stomach) and and am having fewer problems with swelling and bloating of my hands and feet. I won't know about the cholesterol or the liver enzymes until my next physical. This is a High Fructose ""created"" sweetener, up to 90% fructose compared to 50-55% found in HFCS. I for one won't let HFCS or HFAN into my house. …",25 out of 28 users found this review helpful
 Great snack....even during battle!!,5,"I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Superstore). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it. For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product. If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it! …",51 out of 59 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Love it! And mold shouldn't be a problem...,5,"Just received my Beaba today and made two purees for baby. It's convenient, easy to use -- makes making baby food a breeze. Before I was steaming in the microwave, which kills some of the nutrients, not to mention that the plastic I was using may or may not have BPA. With the Beaba I don't need to worry about this anymore! I just take whatever we're cooking for ourselves, pop it into the Beaba and by the time our dinner is ready, so is baby's! I was a little hesitant to purchase this because I read some of the reviews about mold -- and it's difficult to know what the reviewers are referring to exactly without having the product in front of you. Now that I've used the Beaba, I'm wondering if the people who complained of mold were following the directions. I can see how mold could form in the water reservoir if you don't empty it after use. Obviously, mold can form any where there is water pooling for extended periods. However, the instructions clearly state to empty any water from the reservoir after each use, which I did immediately after using. I also left the top off just to ensure that any additional drops left inside would dry up. If you take this precaution, I don't see any way possible for mold to have the opportunity to form. When the instruction booklet talks about descaling the reservoir using vinegar, it's to ensure there is no lime build up-- not mold. After having used the Beaba, I don't think anyone interested in purchasing this should be turned off by claims of mold. If you take care of the machine properly, it won't be a problem. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
