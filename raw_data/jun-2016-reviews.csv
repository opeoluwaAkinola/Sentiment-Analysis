 Beautiful,5,"I received this tree this week. I have purchased Bonsai trees from other online vendors, but none have compared to this starting with the packing of the tree, you could tell it was packed with great care, it arrived in perfect shape. The tree is healthy and beautiful, far more beautiful than the picture shown on Superstore. The tree has a wonderful aroma, it smells like your in a forest, on a fall morning. I could tell it was healthy immediately. Sometimes when you order things on line your disappointed, but not enough to go through the trouble of sending the item back. The minute I saw this tree I had wished I had ordered more. I will order other items from this company, I hope they are as fine as this purchase was.

 bread machine mixes,5,"I've made a lot of bread in my day, worked my way through college in a bakery from 1100 to 0300 hrs, and this is one of the easiest and best sourdough breads that I've ever made. Caution: I recommend that unless you are an experienced baker, use the ""basic"" bread machine setting on your machine. It always comes out perfect and tastes just like you would buy in San Francisco. You can make it by hand, but unless you know what you are doing the results are less then the excellent product that will come out of your bread machine. This mix is equal to your own sourdough starter made bread, and that is saying something in this day and age. A terrific product if you like sourdough bread and do not live in Northern California. (Oh yes, have to add that you need to make sure the water you use is at specifically 80 degrees. Warm tap water will do the trick too.) …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Mixed Review for Mix Flower Bouquet,3,"I ordered two bouguets for two different members of my family for Easter. The first order was delivered promptly and in perfect condition. Flowers were gorgeous (or so I was told). The second order was also delivered promptly (apparently), but FEDEX did not ring the doorbell or knock to deliver them. Instead, they left the flowers on a not-too-often-used porch in 20 degree Michigan weather. They were discovered 2 days later - in poor condition. My parents were home all day - both of them. If FedEx had tried to notify them of the delivery, someone would have heard them. No refund was granted by the company. I believe the company has beautiful flowers, but the use of FEDEX as the delivery service failed them in this case. I will not purchase from any flower company in the future that uses FedEx or UPS. I will choose a company that uses a local florist shop for delivery. A local florist shop will call if they are unable to deliver. I'm disappointed that Falcon Farms did not offer to replace the flowers or issue a refund. …",36 out of 47 users found this review helpful
 better than average but difficult to find better,3,"Dark chocolate is all about marketing and has little to do with quality. Chocolate connoisseurs know better but constitute a small fraction of the gourmet consumer base. Godiva chocolates are delicious and have a wonderful texture. They taste better than Sees Chocolates. Unfortunately, they just don't satisfy my chocolate craving. It's a shame what qualifies as chocolate here. In the US, dark chocolate must contain 15% chocolate liquor; European rules require 35% cocoa solids. American milk chocolate must contain 10% chocolate liquor; European standards require 25% cocoa solids. That means American milk chocolate is 90% not. No wonder those drug store easter chocolates taste so horrible. The ingredients of Godiva are far from top notch. At the prices they charge, it's a crime that Godiva uses artificial vanilla (vanillin), palm kernel oil, lecithin, preservatives, and artificial flavors made in some factory off the New Jersey Turnpike. I doubt real vanilla costs that much more per box of chocolates. Get a Valrhona pure chocolate bar (see other comments on where to purchase or buy conveniently from Superstore). They make one which contains 85% cocoa! …",40 out of 49 users found this review helpful

" cooking, haircare, skincare and more!",5,"Our family avoids chemicals as much as possible, so we use coconut oil for cooking, haircare, skincare and more! We use coconut oil as a moisturizer in place of skin lotion (add a couple drops of a good quality essential oil!) We use coconut oil to saute or steam saute foods; I use a spoonful of coconut oil in our stainless steel cookware so foods NEVER stick! We also use it in our microwave popcorn popper with sea salt for the healthiest, tastiest popcorn around! Coconut is a solid at cooler temperatures, it will turn to liquid when warmed ""slightly"" to the mid 70s. Hence I store this bottle above our stove / microwave so it's usually a liquid. To make it MUCH easier to use, I have a wide mouth glass jar that I keep refilled. When the jar turns solid I can still scoop the oil paste out with a spoon. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Wow,5,"Not really sure if I can describe this salt properly. Yes, it has a wonderful flavor without too much of a salty flavor. It's very clean tasting. Mostly, though, I think it seems ""creamy"". Yea, I know that sounds weird, but the moisture with the salt gives it a creamy-salty embodiment.

 Stank,1,"I have never tried truffles before so I am not sure how they should smell or taste but I'm afraid there is something very wrong with the truffle salt I purchased from this company. When I opened the container I was hit with a sharp acrid smell that was similar to garlic. It was so strong it filled the entire room within seconds, which sent my family reeling with tears in their eyes. I was determined to try the salt in hopes that the flavor would be better than the smell. I cooked a tiny amount in with scrambled eggs. To my horror the flavor was the same as the smell. I asked some friends to try it and they had the same reaction to the smell and flavor as I did. After all the great things I have heard about truffles I find it hard to believe that this is the way they taste and smell. …",6 out of 29 users found this review helpful

 Our Top Choice Coffee,5,"When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types. We marked a rating of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating of one point meant ""Perfect, couldn't be better"", and five points indicated ""Don't like this one"". We rated one to nine cups of each of 30 coffees evaluated. Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top with the most number one ratings. We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts. We do not prefer the weaker strengths. The Parisian Nights has great flavor and aroma with no bitterness. This is a great cup of coffee.

 Miracle Supplement,5,"Magnesium is vitally important on many levels. It not only helps your muscles to relax, but also aids sleep and allows for a more calm & balanced state of mind. Low levels of this mineral make nearly every disease worse, whether you are dealing with asthma, diabetes, depression or cardiovascular disease. It assists in the assimulation of calcium & potassium, so those with osteoporosis concerns should be looking to include Magnesium in their supplements. I have been using Magnesium Calm for the past year and have found it very helpful for relaxing muscle tension, & getting a good nights sleep, not to mention its calming effect on my state of mind !

 Excellent Product,5,I orginally found this product after complaining to Nylabone. I had bought one of their 'Pit Bull Tested' toys - some knobby thing - for my half pit bull mutt. He enjoyed the knobby thing but it was in tiny bits in under 5 minutes. I pulled the package out of the trash and emailed nylabone with a complaint. Much to my surprise they responded the next day and sent me the Galileo Souper bone at no charge. My dog loved it. Nylabone later paid my dog $25 to test a new and improved 'knobby' product but it didn't last either. However the Galileos are great and we keep buying them. We get about 9-12 mos out of each one before they get down to plum size. They keep his teeth nice and clean too. The floor does tend to vibrate when he grasps it with his paws and start gnawing (wood floor over a crawl space) which is a little odd but does impress visitors :-) …,43 out of 43 users found this review helpful

 Not that great,2,"Like many high-carbohydrate instant ""soups,"" the Lentil Couscous Soup is more couscous than soup. Preparation is easy, although mine boiled over when prepared according to the very precise (1 minute, 40 seconds) cooking time in the instructions. I would have preferred a more vague time endpoint and directions to watch for boiling. The resulting food is quite bland as other reviewers have noted, and what this ""low-sodium"" (330 mg) soup really needed was more salt. The flavors that were present were nondescript, neither the couscous nor the lentils providing a distinctive flavor note. I kept looking at the package to see what kind of flavor I should have been expecting. The texture was also pretty monotonous, and the couscous itself did not have the best texture, which was disappointing because good couscous is not that hard to make. As for healthy eating, the product is essentially pasta with lentils added to provide some protein and fiber, and with 37 grams of carbs the 190 calories are pretty empty -- not all that much different from macaroni with low-fat cheese. I'm glad I tried it, I won't mind eating the other 5 cups in the pack, but I won't be buying it again. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" Reality check: dry, dusty, and uninteresting---and expensive",1,"My dogs are decidedly not ""new age"" or impressed by the fact that these dog treats ""are high in protein, naturally preserved with no wheat or corn, no artificial colors of [sic] flavor enhancers, and are free of added hormones, antibiotics and chemical additives."" Out of the bag, these treats seem decidedly overmanufactured, dry, dusty, and uninteresting. But I left it to my Australian Shepherds to decide on their own. During the first taste test, Kirwan, who will throw his head back like an alligator and eat anything tossed his way, crunched through the first one but was not interested in a second helping of these Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. Pippin, who has a more discerning palette, moved his across the rug with his nose and subsequently abandoned it. This morning, I placed a treat on the floor for each dog, and Kirwan ate his without enthusiasm while Pippin again ignored his. Look, I love my dogs and I think Newman's Own is a fine company. But this product seems to me the result of overzealous people going to great lengths to make themselves feel good about what they are feeding their dogs. I cannot imagine the amount of farmland, energy, and resources expended to create these organic dog treats. We are really out of balance here with our priorities and perspectives. Perhaps some animal nutritionist blessed this recipe, the art department created the bucolic packaging, and the marketing folks carefully crafted the spin for this product, all to make us feel good about having these tucked away in our pantries, but at $4 a bag, this will be the only time this product appears in our house. Besides, my dogs, who actually like foul smelling foods and will gloriously roll in who knows what sorts of awful stuff they find, do not like these sorts of boutique fabrications. I really think a reality check is needed. (And I can already feel the sharp sting of venom as folks take me to task for holding a contrarian opinion here.) …",8 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Perfect Cocoa,5,"Everyone in my family likes hot cocoa. I was running plain water through my k-cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids didn't really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow.

 Need to brew small cup size.  Check the price!,3,"I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this. Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans. We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally. I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery. I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed. I usually brew on the 3rd largest size. I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes. This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews. Those who can only brew (or choose to brew) smaller sizes probably like this coffee. Make sure you check the price before you buy. Click more buying choices to get to Superstore's price which is almost half the price of Liquid Nation's and it is eligible for prime.

 Looks like a winner,5,"I'm a serious label-reader, even more so for my cat than for myself, so before I ordered Petite Cuisine, I went to their website to see what they had to say for themselves. I was pleased to read that they use no wheat gluten in their food, nor meat by-products; neither belongs in pet food. They also make a point of saying that they use no products from China. It's a reassurance I appreciate in the light of the recent spate of pet deaths linked to product coming out of China. What they do use was also reassuring. White meat chicken, veggies, olive or soybean oils, vitamins and minerals. The sesame chicken does contain rice which isn't something that should necessarily be fed often, but it's a minor consideration. While it's never said that the ingredients are ""human grade"" they are listed as safe for humans to eat. I don't know about anyone else but I wouldn't want to feed my pets anything that wasn't safe for me to eat. The carton arrived and was marked as ""Product of Thailand"" which was a bit of a surprise since no mention of Thailand appears on their site. They are, however, quick to point out that no child labor is used in production of any of the food. (It's also listed as ""dolphin safe."" This is a pretty politically correct company.) Of course the proof of the pudding, or in this case, the cat food, is the eating. My response as I opened the cans was the the sesame chicken looked and smelled very tempting. The chicken pot pie, not so much. It smells wonderful, but is very watery. Again, this is a minor consideration. If my cat likes it, that's the important thing. He's a picky boy, in part because he can't eat beef or lamb, so he's limited to poultry and certain types of fish. He doesn't tend to like the souped-up, holistic foods that add things like rosemary and acai and all those things which humans so cheerfully add to their own foods. But this stuff is pretty basic, and, well let's just say, he doesn't hate it. I can probably add it to the rotation without causing much consternation, and know that he's getting a quality meal. Your mileage -- or your cat's -- may vary, of course. Cats are perverse little beasts, and you just never know what they're going to take violent dislike to. I can't tell you if your cat will like this food or not, but I can tell you that it looks like quality product made by people who have high standards. Yes, it's pricey, but if you feel, as I do, that your cat deserves the consideration you'd give to any member of the family, you probably won't balk at the cost. The rest is up to your cat. …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 Much better than corn starch for gluten-free cooking.,5,"Many gluten-free baking recipes call for arrowroot, which is hard to find in health food stores. (I'm in Austin, Texas. ?) Anyway, this is incredibly cheap--it's a tenth the price of some suppliers. When to use this: in any recipe where you would use wheat flour for a thickener, like soup, sauce, gravy or pudding. Why to use it: your alternative is corn starch, which can be shiny and tastes like corn. (Imagine vanilla pudding that tastes like corn.) Arrowroot isn't as gluey as corn starch, and doesn't thicken as well, but it won't overwhelm other flavors.

" Average chocolate, strong fillings",3,"These are definitely ""mid-range"" chocolates, not quite as good as Godiva or See's. If you're used to low-end chocolates like Fannie May or Russell Stover, you'll probably find these to be very good. However, if you're used to very good chocolates like La Maison du Chocolat, you'll be sorely disappointed. I found the chocolate to have unexceptional flavor and a somewhat waxy texture. The fillings were mostly very sweet or alcoholic, which is a common practice to cover up mediocre chocolate. I guess they're a good value compared to Godiva, although I think See's Candies has an even better value.

 Excellent product... until Superstore ships it!,2,"I want to start by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily. It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it. Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Superstore anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer. The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic. Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top. Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car. Superstore customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition. In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No. And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism. I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Superstore, too. I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem. Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste. If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice. …",41 out of 47 users found this review helpful
 You get what you pay for - Quality worth every penny spent,5,"This product is everything you would expect, and then some. The shipping was fast. The Matcha is sent in a resealable, heavy-duty FOILED plastic bag, EXCELLENT quality. I recommend using a small tin for everyday use, taking no more than an ounce or two from the larger bag, to preserve the flavor and freshness. The taste is WONDERFUL. Very fresh, very green, very subtle, yet intense. I purchased this product after Starbucks raised their prices (again!), because I had become a frozen green tea frappucino addict...Now I am just a Matcha addict. I love it in the evening warm, in a large mug with a good splash of milk, and simply adore it from the blender with milk, ice cubes, some vanilla syrup and a splash of whipping cream for the frothy, creamy taste...

" Taste, Mixability Poor, Nutrition Optimum",4,"This powder tastes very earthy (think vegetable fibers and peat) frankly. If you're consuming this, you're probably not particularly interested in drinking a milkshake (If you are, go to the Mickey Dees and grab a big ol' glass of milk and assorted toxins). This is not a product that is meant to ""taste like candy"", so if you are used to those designer whey powders that are full of sucralose and/or other artificial toxins and ridiculous flavors like ""Super Duper Berry Cookie Crunch"", then you will find this product to be very disappointing. This product has very low solubility in water or milk, but mixes better with any freshly squeezed (non-factory-processed juices). Fresh squeezed juice will generally have pith, fiber, etc. left in it that adds to its viscosity and greatly lowers the rate of dissolution (how long it takes for the hemp to become 'unmixed' and sink to the bottom of the glass). Essentially, the thicker the solvent, the less that the hemp will settle. Additionally, having the juice at room temperature will further increase the solubility. I might also suggest a shaker/bottle combination of some type, as opposed to an open glass stirred with a spoon. I use a 28-Ounce with BlenderBall, Blue myself. If you want a cheaper way to mix up milled hemp, please note that the above rules are applicable to canned tomato juice, since it is viscous, and stores well at room temperature (and is dirt cheap). Most of the time I take my hemp protein with a can of no-salt-added tomato juice (it is delicious and so easy to make for a low-carbohydrate, high-protein breakfast. This product is pure and truly free of chemicals, there is only one ingredient: Cold-milled hemp protein, mechanically pressed (no reverse osmosis or other chemical processes are used on the hemp seeds). The reason that people consume this is for maximum nutrition. All you get is Protein, antioxidants, heart-healthy fatty-acids, and a little fiber (from the hulls), that is everything nutritionally in this stuff. It is awesome. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Good until it comes back up!,2,"I loved this product when I initially received it. I purchased it to use as a dietary supplement and was pleased to discover that it works wonders on hair and skin as well. I read the label carefully because I was concerned about whether or not to refrigerate. The label clearly said that refrigeration was not required. However, after appx. 2 weeks of using as a daily dietary supplement, I began to notice an awful cramping, nauseous feeling not long after I took it. It was the sickest I have ever felt in my entire life and I repeated it just to be sure that it was the coconut oil causing it and not something else I had eaten. Same thing again. All I can figure is the oil went rancid. There's no other explanation for why it suddenly started causing me to be sick. So, word to the wise, consider refrigerating this product. I've stopped using it altogether because I now associate the smell of it with sickness. :( …",8 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Outstanding Roast,5,"I am a dark-roast coffee drinker who appreciates beans that have been roasted according to generally accepted standards (nonetheless mindful of conflicting definitions of exactly what constitutes say, French v. Italian roast, from one area to another). Apart from very well-known, and might I add expensive, whole-bean coffees sold at Superstore that I have purchased, Coffee Bean Direct Italian Roast Espresso is the first that I have purchased that is, in fact, a true Italian roast. The beans, characteristically, are almost black and are glossy with a pronounced oily surface - as they should be. I brew these beans as ""regular"" coffee as well as Espresso and find that, in either case, they present me the precise dark-roast flavor that I seek. I must admit that my palate, whose acuity is mollified by Balkan pipe tobacco, cannot adequately distinguish the subtle differences amongst different varieties of beans. As a consequence, my singular focus is on the precision of the roasting. Coffee Bean Direct Italian Roast Espresso is spot on in that regard, producing an exquisite cup of coffee - if one prefers a very dark roast. Finally, at a little over $5 per pound, I dare say one is not likely to find a superior, similar roast, at twice the cost. At $27 for a five pound bag (and free shipping), I believe few would be disappointed with this roast as is. Furthermore, one could use this roast, blending it with ""common"" coffees found on local grocers' shelves to add body - and flavor. Well done, Superstore! …",28 out of 32 users found this review helpful
 Best chai you can ever get from a bag.,5,"I have just bought this tea yesterday and made a traditional ""chai"", as I normally do. I've used other brands and types of bagged chai tea before, and they were decent, but nothing like this. I absolutely love my chai to be extremely spicy, and this is it.

It could be that it is just an ordinary flavor enhancing recipe similar to MSG or it could be worse. Might our bodies think it unnatural? Do they mean 'natural' as in from planet earth?

" Taste the RAINBOW, a lot of RAINBOW",4,"UPDATE: Superstore has lowered the price to under $6 x2 a bag which is around $1 less per bag than what we've seen at Wal-Mart. What can I say, it's two giant bags of SKITTLES. You get two 41 ounce resealable bags of SKITTLES, you may have seen these in the Wholesale Clubs or in the candy aisle at your local WAL-MART. Superstore is thankfully selling these themselve's instead of what was previously only available from 3rd party Marketplace sellers who inflate the prices by 2x, 3x, 4x or even more than what you'd pay in a physical store NOT including shipping/tax. Buying direct from Superstore offers you FREE shipping, $25+ of more purchase, or FREE 2 shipping day if you have PRIME, which is great. Our Skittles were double sealed in plastic packaging within a cardboard box with plenty of air pillow bags. The two bags Skittles and thee Skittles themselves were in great condition and weren't expired. Given that WAL-MART charges about $6.50 per bag so this price for two from Superstore is great since you don't have to go down to Walm-Mart or the Wholesale Club and feel like an idiot buying a MEGA bag of Skittles when you bring this up to the cashier.

 What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical,1,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands. This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi. Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering. The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much. While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal. Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products. Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money). Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer. One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer. Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail *Concentrate Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99 Liters of product per container 12 Flavor/l $0.42 *Carbonator Volume of CO2 130 Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99 CO2 cost per liter $0.23 *Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter Equipment cost $89.00 Equipment life (years) 5 Discount rate (cost of money) 8% Liters per month 10.00 Monthly amortized cost $1.80 Cost of equipment per liter $0.18 *Water Cost with Brita Filtration Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004 Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95 Brita cost per liter $0.0373 Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377 (assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration) ***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2 SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73 Without filtered water: SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65 *****What does CO2 Really Cost???? THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW *Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit) weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2 cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35 CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams *Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation losses: 10% available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85% net accessible CO2 of total: 77% usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams *Output carbonated liters of water: 2,479 cost per liter in USD$: $0.014 *SodaStream Output SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product) Cost per refill: $30.00 cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231 *SodaStream Markup Economics ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534% math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing This is an incredible 1500% markup Pros Saves plastic Allows flexible mixture of flavors Cons Cost of output is not compelling Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit ***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times. At the time of this review, I did NOT have an investment in SodaStream either short or long. In the past, I have both owned the stock and shorted it (bet against it).

 Read this article first,2,"2.0 out of 5 stars Read this article first, August 11, 2009 By Pregbaby (Florida) - See all my reviews I thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby. That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...] From the article: Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas. No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity. …",18 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 You can fit 63!,4,"I use three of these across one of my storage shelves in my kitchen. I also have the large drawer that fits under the Keurig. Essentially these 54 pod drawers are for my overflow. This particular brand - Nifty - is... well.... quiet nifty! It's reasonably priced. There are other brands that make this same exact drawer and charge a lot more. Hypothetically speaking, since I use this for storage, I supposed I could use the actual boxes the K cups come in.... but the nice thing about these drawers is that you can easily see when you are running low... versus going in the pantry and sticking your hand in your favorite K cup box to find only a few left (or worse... empty, because some used the last one and didn't tell you!). I think my only con to this is that the drawers are not smooth sliding drawers. Sometimes you have to shimmy the drawer a bit. But that holds true for those 'other' pricer versions as well. Also... you can actualy fit more than 54 in this drawer. I can fit 63. If you alternate between storing each K cup top side up and bottom side up in each row... you can fit 1 extra cup in each row. However, I don't think all of the rows are exactly the same size. The middle row of each drawer is a bit snug.

 False Labeling!!,1,"This stuff is called ""Cook's Organic PURE Vanilla Powder"" but it's definitely nothing of the sort. First of all, anyone should be weary of a ""pure"" vanilla powder that isn't dark brown/blackish in color. That should be the first give away. Cook's PURE Vanilla Powder is a white powder, and anyone who takes a moment to read the ingredient list should not be surprised to find that the #1 ingredient in this ""PURE"" Vanilla powder is, in fact, sucrose. That's right folks, it's sugar. Corn sugar. Cook's calls this product ""a revolutionary vanilla and the first real alternative to pure vanilla extract"" but the truth is there is nothing revolutionary here, and this is a horrible alternative to a perfectly fine product such as pure vanilla extract. As white as this powder appears by looking at the jar, one has to wonder just how much vanilla powder is actually even in there. It can't be much. Or maybe they bleached it? Anyone willing to shell out $55 for 4.9lbs. of corn sugar with a splash of vanilla will be very pleased with this product, but if one were to actually care about their health and well-being, it would be wise to stay clear of this product and purchase some REAL vanilla powder or a vanilla extract instead.

 Cancer Alert,1,"This gum have is an outrage! It worst than Coke Cola. ""When launched Coca-Cola's two key ingredients were cocaine (benzoylmethyl ecgonine) and caffeine.

Coca-Cola did once contain an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass, but in 1903 it was removed.[31] Coca-Cola still contains coca flavoring."" I have read in Wikipedia, that Pemberton was a morphine junkie. This man, a junkie, was allowed to formulate the formula for coca cola. What a low down standard.

 Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS,1,"We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products.

 Why You Should Go With Another Product,2,"Dark chocolate has been well established now to have major heart-health benefits. Only 20 grams (just over 0.7 of an ounce) per day will halve your risk of heart attack, which is a pretty impressive achievement for a chocolate bar! But there is an important caveat here. One of the things I like best about the version of this product that I buy here in Australia is that it has no dairy in it at all. From a health perspective this is very important. Dairy foods block absorption of some of the beneficial phytochemicals in chocolate (the flavanols in particular), which is why eating dark, as opposed to milk chocolate is so important. However, I have also seen a version of this product that does have milk in it, and it is far from clear which version we are getting here. At the time of writing, there is no list of ingredients on the product page. What I can tell you is that Superstore does sell a 70% cocoa version of essentially the same product, on that product page there is a list of ingredients which states that the product on sale DOES contain whole milk powder. The fact that whole (as opposed to skim) milk products are used renders this an especially bad choice, since whole milk products have been found to be more potent in blocking absorbtion of the beneficial flavanols. In response to some of the comments I have already received on this review, it seems to be necessary to stress that whole milk powder is specifically listed AS AN INGREDIENT. We are NOT just talking about the standard warning that the equipment used to manufacture the product may also have come in contact with dairy. What's more, despite the fact that whole milk powder is listed as an ingredient, the 70% cocoa version's product page states that it is suitable for vegetarians and VEGANS [my emphasis]. Do these people even know what ""vegan"" means? It hardly inspires confidence. It's also worth noting that by contrast, this product - the 85% cocoa version - is only described as ""suitable for vegetarians"". No mention of vegans anywhere. This heightens my suspicion that the product on sale here does have dairy in it. All this is a great pity because otherwise I consider it a very fine chocolate. So it may be worth your while to continue watching this space. My hope is that the version on sale here on Superstore will ultimately be replaced by a dairy-free alternative, just as it has been in Australia. Theo. …",21 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Subtly Sweet Vanilla with a KICK.,5,"Vanilla is close to the top of the list of my favorite flavors -- my fave protein supplements have been mostly vanilla based. Add espresso to that, this HAS to be a winner. I got my hands on an advance sample of CLICK Vanilla Latte. And, completely ignoring the fact that my espresso machine is dead, this was the perfect day to try it out. As with any CLICK protein flavor - the suggested method of serving is to add the protein powder to 12-14 ounces of water, and mix well either cold, or warm it up. I added 14 ounces of steaming water from my hot tap on the water dispenser. It was lighter in color than the Mocha Flavored CLICK, more like a cappuccino. It even frothed, but that could have been from the psycho blending I do to it.

 Powder is better value,5,"I think the K20 protein drinks are fantastic. I am a vegetarian and am always looking for ways to supplement my protein intake. I first tried the actual bottled drinks for K2O; I was disappointed that there was only about 5g of protein (about 2/3 cup of milk), but when I tried the drink and found, not only no aftertaste as many of the other protein drinks out there have, but excellent flavors... I was hooked. My problem is that even in bulk... they were priced at around $2 a bottle (around $24 for 12 bottles) which is out of my budget. Then came the powders which you can just mix in a 16-20 oz cup or bottle of water. If I buy a case of bulk water at my local warehouse for around $5 (or just use filtered water at home) the cost for 28 bottles is now anywhere from about $5-$10 less than the price of only 12 premixed bottles. Plus they are significantly easier to transport to work. Now I have the best of all worlds... added protein to my vegetarian diet... low calorie, great tasting drinks... and a very reasonable price. I have them on subscription now! …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Great product! No hormones or antibiotics in the meat!,5,"I adopted my dog about 6 months ago and he had digestive problems that the vet could find no cause for. He would get diarrhea with mucous in stools regularly. His stools would vary from constipated to unformed soft stool. I decided to switch him to a better quality food and did a lot of research. Newman's Own had all the qualities I was looking for, so I switched him to it gradually - 1/2 Purina One and 1/2 Newman's Own at first and gradually more Newmans' Own in the mix until finally 100% N.O. Ever since switching about six weeks ago, he has not had constipation or loose stools. I also don't hear his tummy roiling after meals like before. And despite what a few reviewers have written, the chicken and beef used in the pet food, while not ""organic"", is ""natural"" and raised without hormones and antibiotics. According to [...] ingredients list: ""Natural Chicken - Raised without growth hormones and antibiotics and fed only a 100% natural, all-vegetable diet, the chicken meat provides amino acids essential for muscles, hormones, enzymes, antibodies and structural and protective tissues."" Also, the beef is free-range anad range fed w/ no hormones & antibiotics.

" Creamy maybe, but not bold",3,"The quality ""Bold"" stated in the title of this jalapeno sauce is a misnomer. The jalapeno flavor is very mild. Very, very mild. And it is even somewhat sweet to boot. The sauce is not thick, therefore, it might do quite nicely as a dip with potato chips as it wouldn't crush or break them. But you'd have to like the flavor. It would also probably be suitable as a light salad dressing, e.g., lettuce and tomato. (Re-edited version: after I posted this, I tried the sauce on just such a light salad, and it did turn out to taste quite pleasant on it.) As for its being right as a taco sauce, as a long-time veteran of tacos living near the Mexican border, I find that claim absurd. We're a bit more daring with our beloved taco sauces here in the West. As for sandwich wraps, it might do. Personally, I'd prefer good old mayonnaise or even mustard. Some of the ingredients are: buttermilk, egg yolk, sugar and salt, with less than two percent of cheddar cheese and red and green bell peppers. The sodium level seems high at 310 mg., and two tablespoons of the sauce contain 110 calories. The only vitamin noted is Vitamin A at four percent. Although this sauce is definitely not to my taste, it might appeal to those who like ""a little bit of Mexico"" on their food, but not too much. Just a little bit! …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Agree with the other reviewers,1,"Don't let the ""Earth's Best"" name fool you .. as stated in multiple reviews here - CHECK THE INGREDIENTS! No wonder so many positive reviews here have the same theme, ""My kids will only eat Earth's Best!"" .. Well that's because they are all SWEETENED, which is one of the worst things you can feed to your child regularly. They WILL develop a sweet tooth QUICKLY, and will start rejecting pure vegetables / other good things because of this. There is no need to inject applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods. That's just shameful, and there is only one reason for it - so the child will eat it and only want this brand. Best advice - if you must buy pre-made food, be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredient(s) and (if needed) water. That's it. Don't buy a vegetable that has ""applesauce"" or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that brand because it's sweetened. Shame on Earth's Best as a company. Kudos to their marketing department for creating a name whereas consumers will automatically be drawn to them because they think it's a great product based solely on the name. …",6 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Great right out of the can,5,"This 100% pure organic sweet potato puree is slightly tart, so it can be used in many recipes--like sweet potato pie or casseroles--without adding lemon juice. For a fast side dish, dip a couple of tablespoons of puree straight from the can, stir in a little of your favorite sweetener and spice and serve. Cover tightly before refrigerating the leftovers--air causes the puree to discolor. Overall it's a tasty and very handy way to add a nutritious super vegetable to your meals, plus it works great in classic sweet potato recipes. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" Great food, feed sensibly",5,"This is great food; it has natural ingredients and is formulated to be as close as possible to a cat's natural diet. I switched my kitten to this food with NO issues, not even the smelly stools others complain about and I'll explain why. I am into body building and diet and I know that when you switch from bad food to good food, you actually need to eat less and adjust from there. The smelly stools occur when there is undigested (unused) protein in the stools. Thus you need to balance your cat's food intake and exercise so that he's getting enough food for his or her energy needs. Too little and your cat will definitely let you know, too much and the stools will let you know. I feed my cat Innova Wet and Dry food, leaving dry food out all day with one serving of wet food in the morning or at lunch time. Unless my cat has finished all his food early on in the day, I don't feed him any more of either; no matter how much he meows (it took about a week or two to change his routine). Also, if he's finished or nearly finished his food by the time I go to bed, I don't refill his bowl till morning. I would strongly recommend consulting your vet and watching your cat closely while adjusting his feeding. Watch for energy levels, alertness, responsiveness and overall demeanor. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 Gotta Love a Good Cuppa,5,"I am a coffee drinker of the first order. I used to drink a couple pots a day, but now I've cut way, way back, so now that I'm not into quantity, I'm into quality. I really enjoy, really savior a good cuppa joe. I've given up my Mr. Coffee and now have a Home Brewing System and I make my coffee a cup at a time and I really love it. It only takes a minute to make a cup and each cup is different, depending on my mood. I've been drinking K-cup coffee for a couple years now and have more of these little cups in my house than you can shake a stick at. For awhile I used a Carosel , made by Keurig, but I had to keep filling it and also it was kind of clumsy for me. Besides, my coffee affliction is way to huge to be held down to a little spinning coffee merry-go-round. For the first few months my coffee problem went spinning out of control. I had boxes and boxes of coffee in my pantry, refrigerator, cupboards, garage, even in the trunk of my car, but now I've sort of got my gourmet coffee disorder in hand and down to twenty-eight flavors. For Breakfast I have my favorite seven and they are: Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Fair Trade Nicaraguan Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Bold Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend Tully's French Roast Coffee Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast Timothy's World Coffee, Morning Blend Coffee People Coffee, Wake Up Call Bold For Lunch I have my favorite seven and they are: Gloria Jean's Coffees Hazelnut Coffee Emeril's Big Easy Bold Gloria Jean's Coffees Black Gold Extra Bold Timothy's World Coffee, Private Blend Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Parisian Nights Timothy's World Coffee, Colombian La Vereda Gloria Jean's Coffees GJ Special Blend And for dinner, yes I drink coffee in the evening as well, but that's not so bad, considering I don't drink, don't smoke, don't eat sweets and eat very little meat. Sometimes I'll eat meat, but not often, so a cup of coffee with dinner doesn't seem so bad, considering. If it kept me up at night, well then that would be different, but it doesn't. Anyway for dinner I'll drink one of these seven: Tully's Full City Roast Coffee Gloria Jean's Coffee, Mudslide Timothy's World Coffee, Italian Blend Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic Extra Bold Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark Gloria Jean's Coffee, Classic Reserve And then there is my absolute favorite, number twenty-two and that is Bold Rainforest Espresso , a Timothy's World Coffee. I keep my little individual cup packages in three large assorted tupperware tubs, marked in of course, ""Breakfast"", ""Lunch"" and ""Dinner"". So when I reach into the breakfast tub for example, I never know which of the seven flavors I'm going to wind up with. I don't drink coffee during my meal, but afterwards, instead of desert. It's a quiet time for me. I think and reflect over my coffee as I delight in each and every sip. I know for some, having twenty-two different flavors of coffee in my kitchen might seem a bit much, maybe even a bit quirky, well everyone's gotta have their quirks, besides, I've cut way down. Now, about that twenty-second flavor. When I absolutely have to have an extra cup during that quiet, coffee drinking them, then that's the flavor I go for. How often does that happen, when one cup isn't enough? Only about once a day. Still, from two pots a java a day, down to four cups, is a pretty good thing, I'm not as wired as I used to be, but let's face it, I'm still running on caffeine. That's not so bad though, better a coffee crutch than something else. In my opinion these are the twenty-two best cups of joy in the whole wide world. At least the best twenty-two flavors I've come across in the hundreds I've tried. But please don't take my word as gospel, everybody's different. You have to dive right right in, take a chance, try several flavors till you find the one or the twenty-two that you like best. …",21 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 Convenience Store Cappuccino,2,"I was so excited to see this product (Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino) for my beloved Keurig. I usually brew flavored coffee into a mug of heated milk & a touch of sugar. I thought this would be a step faster & a step up from my usual morning cup. I was dismayed to read that the first ingredient is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but I figured I'd make the small nutritional sacrifice in the name of morning caffeine happiness. Well, it turns out the taste is nothing like a true cappuccino, but almost identical to a convenience store (7/11) machine cappuccino. If you love that flavor, you'll love this k-cup. I thought those instant-flavored coffees were GREAT when I was a college student!) Another complaint about this new k-cup is that the box suggests you run a hot water cycle (sans k-cup) after making the cappuccino. I presume this is to rinse out any dairy or sugar product which could muck up your machine. I'm glad for the tip, but wish I didn't have to run down the water in my reservoir. I'd hate to throw this coffee out, so this morning I brewed a cup of this and then followed it with a plain coffee k-cup. It isn't as sweet and has more ""real"" coffee in it, but it still tastes very artificial. FYI: In addition to the artificial dairy & sweeteners, the cappuccino uses instant coffee.) …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful

I bought a case and stored them in my kitchen which is cool. The bread was fine however within 1 week I opened a second loaf and noticed mold inside one of the loaves.

Anyway I then filed an A-Z claim to wait over another week for Superstore to send me this short curt mail saying it was not covered under A-Z , I was shocked as they knew why I was claiming this item and now to say not covered is very poor service indeed.

" Outstanding, Bold, Lively Sumatran. best of the K-cups",5,"First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine. Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being ""tangy"" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich. IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4. I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc. Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star. Stale and bitter. I will definitely stay with Puck's. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

The ingredients list reads like a pack of Fruit Roll Ups: Water, Glycerin, Flavors - Natural and Artificial Extracts and Flavors. These bitters taste awful. There's a slight grapefruit flavor behind the awful, overpowering lime (as in limestone, not key lime) flavor. If you want grapefruit flavor in your drinks, this isn't the bitters for you. You should really just buy a bag of grapefruits and spritz a small amount of juice into your drink. I've used this in a couple of drinks, and each turned out poorly.

 The great Australian condiment and beer by-product,5,"Vegemite, the great Australian condiment and beer by-product. This is a jar of vegemite. Real vegemite, not that half-strength new stuff. Not a big jar, but with Vegemite, a little goes a long way. Really. There is even a rumour that no non-Australian has ever finished a jar. Also, don't worry about the expiry date. Vegemite never goes off, even keeping it in a cupboard in the heat of an Australian summer, so you do think the sub-Arctic conditions of Europe or the USA will have any impact on it? Nuclear waste will decay faster than this stuff. Alright, so you have your jar of vegemite. Advanced users can find recipes involving vegemite as a dip, in cooking with meat, etc. But if you are an advanced user, why read a review? Walk away from the computer and go and eat some vegemite right now. For you interested novices, here goes: 1. Buy vegemite. 2. Eat vegemite, preferably on buttered toast or grilled with cheese. Step 2 probably needs a little explanation. Vegemite is not peanut butter, or marmalade. It is best used in moderation. Very moderate moderation. So get your slice of bread, and toast it if you wish. Spread butter on it - as thickly as you like. This is vital, both to cut the richness of the vegemite, and also to act a lubricant (spreading vegemite on dry toast or bread is a recipe for disaster - just because it resembles engine oil does not mean it has the same physical properties). Now, get a little vegemite on a knife. Less than that. Probably a third or half what you started with. You only need enough to faintly discolour the butter with a brownish tinge. Do the same thing with another slice of bread, or just fold over the one you have to make a sandwich. Now eat the sandwich. Vegemite is an acquired taste, but its not too hard to pick up. Remember, we feed this stuff to infants in Australia - and they love it. Try it with both toast and plain bread. If you can't enjoy a vegemite sandwich, there is one more thing to try: a vegemite and cheddar cheese sandwich (Don't try using Brie, or any fancy cheese for that matter). Its best using toast, and then spread vegemite as above. Slice the cheese quite thinly - about 1/16th of an inch - and lay over the top. Leave the sandwich open and grill in the over until the cheese bubbles. Remove, let cool slightly, and eat. Its best on a cold rainy day -but good anytime. If you like that, you can build up to using more vegemite on your butter. But always be careful, as mistakes have been made by those who thought they ready to try more and more vegemite. Some will even talk about the experience; most never will. Vegemite is a great source of vitamin B, and tastes yeasty and salty, in an indescribable sort of way. It has to be tasted to be understood. …",64 out of 64 users found this review helpful

Did you know real meat isn't RED, like in the store. If blood is drained properly, it is brownish. A green sheen means it's rotting, but red meat is just dye. …",2 out of 55 users found this review helpful
 I would order this product again if ...,1,"... only I could be assured that it would arrive undamaged. I only gave this product one star because of the packing during shipment. The product itself gets four stars from me. I have used this oil before and I really love it. But I ordered twice and both times I couldn't use the oil because the cans were so severely bent-in. Can't changes be made in how these cans are packed for shipment? Surely they aren't stocked in such horrible condition! The two little air pillows placed on top of the cans did nothing to keep them from banging into each other during shipping. Does anyone listen to the complaints that are posted? Does anyone care? On the chance that someone is listening, please change the way you pack this product for shipment. Pieces of heavy cardboard that can't move placed between the cans might work best. And add some environment friendly 'peanuts' as well as a ""FRAGILE"" warning. Please continue to give us the products we want in the condition we deserve. Thanks for letting me share my two cents' worth. …",9 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 This Stuff Is Amazing,5,"I have been plagued with a biting red ant problem in a rocked area running the length of my driveway that actually started last summer. I was reluctant to put poison down and hoped the Colorado winter would eliminate the issue. The opposite happened and it has been impossible to walk down my driveway this summer without getting my legs swarmed by biting ants. I covered the area twice with borax - which seemed to send them below ground just long enough to have Town Hall meetings and come out fighting mad. In desperation I purchased 3 containers of this hoping to make the situation even a little better. I sprinkled ONE container lightly over the area just to guage the effect. I kid you not, ALL THE ANTS ARE GONE. I keep checking to see if they will reappear with tanks and airplanes and cannons aimed at my garage, but they are GONE. This stuff is amazing. …",57 out of 59 users found this review helpful
 Real Customer Service,5,"I ordered this collection on 6/9/10 and it arrived on 6/12. Although it was was very well-packaged, this did not prevent the USPS from managing to break one of the tubes. The seller was contacted by email and a replacement requested. As this was a birthday gift and the occasion was only a week away, I offered to pay for expedited shipping. Seller responded immediately stating that a replacement would be shipped ASAP. The replacement tube arrived three days later in good shape. My offer to pay additional shipping charges was declined. In summary, this product is excellent and the customer service absolutely first rate. I highly recommend both the product and the seller. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Coffee Treat,5,"I'm a long time coffee junkie. I think I had my first cup when I was five or six years old. One of my most potent memories as a child growing up in New York was going to Schraffts or Chock Full 'O Nuts to enjoy a cup of coffee, New York style. I've gone from stove top percolated pots to electric pots to camp-fire brewed to drip machines. And I must include several years of ""chow hall"" coffee while in the military. I've been using whole beans for many years and even spent a few years roasting my own beans. In all, some sixty years of varied levels of products & as varied means of delivery. Then a friend recommended Yirgacheffe. Now I cannot compare Coffee Bean Direct's Yirgacheffe product to other roasters but I can say, without exception, this is one fine tasting coffee. Two cups, prepared with a French press, and my day begins in a most positive way. The price is right, the quality is outstanding and the taste - well you have to try it for yourself. Do yourself a favor, you'll enjoy the flavor. Coffee Bean Direct has a winner with this coffee. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Don't believe the hype people!! Please don't give up this company!,5,"This formula is the best out there. Don't be a media-hype sucker. The media are well paid to produce unnecessary hysteria by big business like Hain Celestial Group who happen to produce EVERY organic baby formula including the store brands, except Nature's Only. A little convenient no? Look, EVERY piece of produce you eat, organic or not, and anything produced from that produce has arsenic along with many other heavy metals in it, from past pesticide abuse. Your tap water, well water, even the bottled spring water and juices you drink have more arsenic in them in some cases than this formula. The Dartmouth Doctor who did the testing has admitted as much plus stated the testing they used has an inaccuracy of up to 40%! They did not use the government standard. To boot the other formulas use corn syrup which was recently found to have high levels of mercury and that stupid Life's DHA which is derived from algae using horrible chemicals like hexane. You are telling me that's safer? My daughter has thrived on this formula. I have never had to switch her from anything. Once I stopped breastfeeding, I went right to this and have never had issues. My older son on the other hand, I had to switch the big brand formulas like five time to finally have one that didn't make him sick with digestive issues and colic plus eczema! By that point he was almost off of formula. I swore I would not make the same mistake again and I fully trust and believe in this formula. I am so tired of this world's misinformation for financial gain at the cost of our health. Please do some research about EVERYTHING you put in your and your children's mouths before you put it in you. The reality is that this one news story has possibly permanently damaged a reputable small business trying to feed our kids right. …",11 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Formula change. IT NOW HAS GRAINS,2,"I loved the food for my cats as you can read below. However when it came time for me to buy another bag I read the ingrediants again, something I do to make sure there were no chnages. I was concerned as my cat with the Yeast on her skin had started getting it again. To my dismay I read that Oats has been added to the formulation. WHat it it that Blue Buffalo Doesn't understand that Oats is a GRAIN and they can't now call the formulation GRAIN free. I hve had to change to another brand of cat food. Shame on you. I have 2 Ragdolls. One is 3 years old. SHortly after I brought her home as a kitten she developed yeast growind on her skin. It was on her face, eyes and mouth. I took her to many vets even a dermatologyst who charged a fortune and none could figure out what she had. I had used a grain litter as it seemed like the healthy thing to do. I changed her bowl from plastic to ceramic to stainless steel and nothing made a difference. I would spend an hour a day cleaning and blow drying her. It had spread down to the area where a mane would grow and she lost fur wherever it was. My vet took in a new partner who reacted in horor when he saw her. He did a scraping, sent to the lab and found it was yeast. All the other expensive tests that were done never showed yeast. I started her on a grain free diet that helped a lot but after a year all of a sudden it got worse again. The manufacturer changed the ingredient. I tried a few other products and after a short time the same thing happened. Grain free was no longer really grain free. For some reason the companies didn't know that wheat is not the only grain out there. Oats, was added and some other grains. I was at a loss and dthen I saw Blue Buffalo's Wilderness. I tried it and as each day went by her yeast growth would get less. It took around 2 weeks for the other foods to get out of her system. SHe now has just a tiny amount of yeast around her mouth and her fur is growing back. Her tail the was once goreous and then sparsly covered with fur is becoming beautiful again. I only have to wash her mouth area every 3 days to remove the yeast, instead of the hour a day I used to spend.I think if the flax was taken out she would be yeast free as flax is a grain. I am thrilled with the difference as is my cat. My vet wanted to know what I did and he told me that most cat owners end up putting their cats to sleep as they can't deal with it. I also changed to a pine litter over a year ago which helped somewhat. My other act developed crystals in her urine which then became sludge. THe vets flushed her bladded but it didn't help. She was getting cortisone shots to help with the swelling of her bladder and the bleeding. I told the vet to biopsy her bladder which is surgery and he cleaned out her bladder. The pathology report said she has cystities. He didn't like giving her the Cortisone as it has bad side effects. I didn't like it either but she would stay in her litter box all day when she would start bleeding and did not feel good at all. It would take the con around 3 days to work and then she would be o.k. for around a month, then 3 weeks and then after the surgery it started again after 2 weeks. I told my vet he would have to put her down if this kept up. She is only 2 and this started when she was 1 1/2 years old and was my favorite pet. He gave her a shot of cortisone and I told hin we would see how long it lasted before she would start bleeding again. The food I had been giving her had Soy in it and she was getting a hypoallergenic treat that had SOy oil in it. I noticed that she would get worse when I would give her the treat. I ahd swithced to the Blue Buffalo for my other cat and it had not Soy in it and I stopped the treats. It is nwo 7 weeks since she had any bleeding from her bladder. I stopped the soy when the vet told me she had cyctities as I know Soy gives cysts to women due to it have plant estrogen in it. The vet had given me foods that were expensive to try that were made specificly for the crystals and she wouldn't touch them. SHe had become an obese cat that didn't want to do anythin when she got sick. SInce she had the food change she lost a lot of weight and is a playful happy cat again. I hope Blue Buffalo doesn't change the ingredients ( except perhaps to take out the flaz)as it has saved the life of my 2 cats that I love dearly. No more yeast, no more crystals, sludge or cystities. I told my vet whta I had figured out and one has called me to ask me what I had done for the yeast as he had a cat that had it and he had to put down cats whose owners couldn't deal with it. I hope other cat owners who have these problems would try WIlderness and see if it helps their cat. Thank you Blue Buffalo. WHen I told him she was doing well he told me he should send his patients to me when he can't cure. Update 5/12 . THe cats have been on the food since December. Both are doing beautifuly. THe one with the yeast on her body and severe loss of fur, now has a beautiful coat. She is no longer hiding 24/7. SHe is a happy cat. The one with cycstitis and sludge is as happy and healthy as can be. If I hadn't tried this food she would have been put to sleep months ago. Please keep the formula you are using. A very greatful cat owner. …",29 out of 32 users found this review helpful
