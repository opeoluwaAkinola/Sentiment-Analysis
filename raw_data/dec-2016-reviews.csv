" Seams split, some bags slashed",1,"I had been happily using these bags for about a year, and ordered them through Superstore's subscribe and save, but in my last shipment of 4 boxes, two of the boxes had bags with weak side seams which split open when I tried to use them. Also, in one of the boxes, some of the bags were slashed or cut, even though the box itself was whole and unmarked. That's 100 bags that are completely unusable. According to Superstore's return policy, this item is not eligible for return, so you'd be out some money if you order this item and it's defective. I have contacted Superstore anyway, and also written to Biobag USA to register a complaint. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful

" Seems like a healthy choice. . . but, it's really not.",4,"This review is for the grapefruit flavor, but I've tried clementine and pomegranate, too. I'm continually surprised at what passes for ""healthy"". I received this product to review but was already familiar with Izze sodas, as they're available at most Starbucks and now at grocery stores, as well. These are 8.4 oz cans and each can is 90 calories. Since nutritional data isn't included in the item description, I'll include them here. Each 8.4 oz serving has 10 mg sodium, 20 gm carbohydrates, and 20 grams of sugar. So, for those who believe this is a ""healthy"" alternative to sodas, I would disagree. An 8-oz serving of Caffeine-free Coca Cola Classic has 97 calories, 27 grams of carbohydrates, 33 gm sodium, 24 grams of sugar. So, really, having an Izze isn't such a healthy alternative to having a coke. You aren't reducing your sugar intake with an Izze nor will you reduce your carb intake. Yes, it's juice and ""natural"" but your body responds to sugar and carbs quite the same whether the sugar comes from juice or another source. The sugars that come from juice is fructose-- and your body responds to fructose the same way it responds to table sugar. They both cause your insulin levels to increase. Each 8 oz glass of juice has about 8 full teaspoons of sugar. So, if this 8.4 oz can of Izze soda is made up of 70% juice, you are still consuming 5.8 teaspoons of sugar. Whole fruit is much healthier than juice since the fiber has not been stripped away. Fiber moderates the release of the sugar in your bloodstream and moderates the insulin release. Sorry for the nutrition lesson. Izze sodas TASTE good-- and even this Grapefruit (and I don't care for grapefruit) tastes good. As long as one understands they aren't having something ""healthy"" when they have this sparkling juice, great-- if it's just taste you are looking for, give this a try. Sometimes, though, a pretty label and a spot on a shelf in the Organic Food store causes people to believe that what they are consuming is healthy when, in fact, it's just not. I received a case of 24 cans. My family enjoys Izze sparkling juices because they taste good and, because we have them, I don't mind them drinking them. Even though I will occasionally purchase Izze juices for my children when we're out and hit Starbucks, I never buy sugary drinks at the store. I consider these sparkling juices to be empty calories. When this supply is through, we won't buy them again to keep at home. 4 stars for taste. …",35 out of 49 users found this review helpful

 Works for spiders! Follow directions carefully.,4,"The placement of these traps is key to their success. As per the instructions, if you don't see anything in the trap in 24-72 hours, move the trap. If you do see something within that time frame, place more traps nearby as this is likely close to an ""infestation"". I'm not really sure how well these traps attract bugs and spiders. At one point, there were several stink bugs congregating just inches from one of the traps; they showed no interest in the trap, choosing instead to discuss politics and global warming. I really stress that placement is critical. I have found that putting these in dark corners and under things where creepy crawly creatures like to hide tends to net the most kills! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Love my fake sugar...,5,"Splenda...aka...sucralose To be clear, I do believe this is not the same SIZE bag you can readily pickup in your local supermarket. The local Walmart, Target, Publix and Albertons bags are of the 9.7 ounce variety, not this huge gigantic bag. So this is in essence, two of those bags for this price. Pretty even I would think. I love this stuff and it for all things that need sweetening. I put it in coffee, a little in my high fiber cereal, sometimes in high protein smoothies, sometimes to sweeten my green tea, and just about anything else I can make that needs extra sweetness. I don't bake yet so would think I need the bake friendly version. ;) …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful
" Whey Low Type ""D"" Granules Rating.",3,"This is a good product and meets all of the promises expressed by the manufacturer. I thought initially that it had the same sweetness as sugar, but for some reason I found myself using more of it than I would have used refined sugar under the same circumstances. I don't know if it's because of the very fine granules (much finer than table sugar), or if it just wasn't really quite as sweet as table sugar; it's hard to say. I doubt I will purchase this product again unless it comes down in price. The price seems reasonable until you factor in shipping charges and, again, the fact that it goes so quickly. I purchased a 1 lb. bag and it only lasted for about 10 days. The same amount in table sugar would have lasted a month or longer! I got it to bake with and to use in my coffee but it went so fast I never got the a chance to bake with it! I have used Suzanne Somers' ""Somer Sweet"", made from a Chinese fruit, so it's a safe artificial sweetener and it's 5 times sweeter than sugar. I found it to be much more cost-effective than the whey low because the price is comparable but it lasts a very long time. I went back to that for my coffee. I have not baked with that product yet, although the manufacturer says that it works beautifully in baking. Hope this helps. …",14 out of 18 users found this review helpful
" It's not coffee, but I like it just as much as coffee",5,"I bought a bag of Mediterranean Java at my NFS yesterday to try, and I think it tastes great with the same ""mouth feel"" as coffee. I even get a bit of a coffee head buzz from it, but it has no caffeine. I had been using those instant grain coffee substitutes like Roma and Cafix, and they are kind of watery with a taste that is no better than just OK. The difference is that with those instant substitutes, I am fully aware that I am depriving myself of real coffee, but the Teeccino is just something good and different, but not a sacrifice. I just ordered a 3-pack of Teeccino in 11-oz bags from Superstore since I plan to drink this stuff as long as they keep making it. With Superstore's lower price, free shipping, and no sales tax, I save about 33% over what it costs to buy it locally. Thanks, Superstore. ETA 4/19/2010. I ordered the $12.95 (includes shipping) sample pack from the Teeccino website and got it two days later in TN from CA. It includes packs of all ten varieties and each pack makes a quart of full-strength brew. Some of the flavors I really didn't like, so it was a lucky accident that I randomly picked my favorite of all ten, Mediterranean Java, the first time I bought an 11-oz bag. I don't like most flavored coffee, so I didn't like flavored Teeccino any better, but that is no slam against Teeccino in particular since some people love something like Amaretto in a hot drink. Anyway, my advice is to buy the sampler, then get your 3-packs of whatever you like best from Superstore. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Good Clean Barley,5,"Not much to say here. The barley is as advertised. The shipping was slower than I expected, especially since the state of origin isn't all that far from my home, but the price was better than I could find anywhere else. This is hulled barley, which has the bran intact, unlike pearl barley. It takes longer to cook, but it also keeps better and that is what I want in a grain. Also, of course, having the bran intact means having the bran to eat, which is more fiber in our diets. I have cooked this whole in a stew, and it was the same as pearl barley in appearance. I cracked it in a Corona mill and it then cooked up like rice in a soup. When we poured it into the storage bucket, the grain appeared clean. There was no dirt or foreign plant material. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 My Family's #1 Formula,5,"Enfamil Premium Lipil Formula is the same as the previous flagship Mead Johnson formula--Enfamil Lipil--except that it has ""prebiotics"" added in. Our son was on Enfamil Lipil from September 2007-September 2008. He was breastfed and formula fed during this time. Our daughter, who is due in January 2010, will also be breastfed and formula fed for her first year of life. We tried two other formulas with our son--Similac Advance and Parent's Choice. The Similac was fine but clumped badly. During the time we experimented with the Parent's Choice formula, my son was consistently troubled by colds and the flu. I think the Parent's Choice formula lowered his immunity somehow and will never use it again. I believe that Mead Johnson's decision to use prebiotics is a good one. Our son had colic/acid reflux in part because his digestive system was not yet populated with the good bacteria for breaking down milk proteins. He was a lot more comfortable after we started putting a little Culturelle (a probiotic) in his formula in the evening. And since a lot of our immune system is in our digestive tract, he had fewer sick days after introducing the Culturelle. Probiotics and prebiotics will also help infants rebound from the negative effects of antibiotics like amoxicillin quicker. Regarding the bpa found in formula can liners, I talked to an Enfamil customer service representative who told me that Mead Johnson now uses cans that are lined with a ""modified polyester"" that is bpa free. Similac Advance Earlyshield comes in a bpa-free can also (the SimplePac container). Another concern parents have is the cost of formula. Name brand formulas are expensive! But if you think about it, you are feeding a human being for about $15 a week (a can usually lasts us 1.5 to 2 weeks). $15 a week is peanuts compared to what a hungry teenager devours! And with name brand formulas you are getting the absolute best product available--Bill Gates couldn't buy a better formula than what's on the shelves at Target or Wal-mart. If you are a new parent and feel overwhelmed by the infant formula section of your grocery store (as I was in September 2007), I suggest starting with the flagship formula of either Mead Johnson (Enfamil Premium Lipil), Abbott Laboratories (Similac Advance Earlyshield), or Nestle (Good Start Gentle Plus or Good Start Protect Plus). They are all excellent infant formulas. You just have to see what works for you and your baby. …",22 out of 24 users found this review helpful

It does have a strong 'soy' taste to it 'raw,' however I found that once the pancakes were done it was pleasant and ""better than regular pancakes"" as my husband stated. My almost 3yr old also enjoyed them as well without batting an eye. I think it is worth giving it a try and then evaluate for yourself, you never know till you try it how you'll feel about it!

 BEWARE - Superstore LIMITS THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU CAN BUY,1,"The food is GREAT. The cats have gotten completely addicted to it.

Long story, and 2 phone calls plus 2 emails later, I was told I have bought the LIFETIME MAXIMUM of this product.

 Not bad but not Jasper proof,4,"This toy is great for preventing my dog from inhaling all his food. Unfortunately it takes him less than an hour to empty it, so it's doesn't keep him as occupied as long as I'd like. So far minimal/suspected wear (bottle is scratched up and some of the nibs of the rubber chew part are gone) and I'm waiting to see if he manages to untie the knot of the rope (like he has on another toy). Update 6/30/07: The screw on part has suffered some damage. It's almost as if Jasper bit it while it the toy was intact, nearly breaking a chunk out of it. Looks like I'm gonna have to buy another or find another toy. (So if I could I'd drop my rating to 3 stars.) Update 12/30/07: Now the rope is ""unraveling"" near the top knot and it's getting stuck in the opening, making it hard for even me to get the rope out enough to dislodge the food. So it's definitely time for a new toy to dispense Jasper's food, which could very likely be this one simply for the ease of loading the food. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 A delicious treat,5,"Well, since some other user decided they'd paste their review on to each flavor allow me to give my short but sweet review: MiO is delicious. I like that I can just put in the tiniest of splashes in my drink and just have a hint of flavor... or splash a lot in and get a real flavorful experience. It's a quick and easy thing to use. It's also fun to watch it splash into the water. I've also found it's good to flavor different types of alcohol. In regards to the criticism by other reviewers for it containing propylene glycol - don't be in a panic like them. propylene glycol is harmless unless ingest massive quantities of it. Using a canard like ""it's considered harmful to pets so humans shouldn't ingest it!"" is just alarmist behavior. Chocolate is harmful to dogs. Better not eat that then! Lastly, in regards to it having so many ""food colorings"" - well, if you don't like anything that flavors your water to have anything artificial in it, squeeze a lemon into it. Put a dash of sugar. Or just drink the water plain. You know what you're getting into when you buy this stuff. Bottom line: This is my new favorite drink flavoring.

 King of Root Beers,5,"Hi, I am a HUGE Root Beer Fanatic. I have always loved the Natural, micro brew, old fashioned root beers. But for some reason the root beer I liked the best was Boylan's Root beer which ironically is an artificial root beer. Then one day I was strolling throught the soda section of my local health food store looing for some natural root beers when I stumbled upon Boylan's ""The Natural Kind"" Root Beer. I almost fainted right there in the aisle! It was my favorite root beer only better! it was made micro-brew style with REAL ingredients. Then for about 2 months I was constantly in and out of the store getting that root beer. I was just like the Boylan's root beer that I had come to love only it was, as I said above, better! First of all, the second you taste the root beer you can tell the quality of craftsman-ship that went into making the root beer. The root beer is creamy and velvetly smoothe. It just slides down your throat. The amazing thing is that you then notice that it is definitley the signature Boylan's cane sugar root beer flavor. The flavor is deep and complex but mild. I know this sounds contradictory but you'll understand when you taste it for yourself. Then something terrible happened. I was going into the store to get my weekly bottle only to find that the store had discontinued the root beer. I was so upset I seriously almost cried. But then I have discoverd that Superstore sells it. I can't stress to you enough how much I like this root beer. -Desty …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Outstanding Food for both healthy and sick cats,5,"I first switched to this food for my senior cats who both had cancer (most likely from my feeding them cheap food all their lives - never again). Within days of starting my cancer-cats on this food they both perked up, gained weight, and actually maintained the last few months of their lives in an active and normal manner. Both of course finally succumbed to cancer, but even the vet was surprised at how long they lived after diagnosis, and how brief the period of their final decline was (they both sort of bottomed out within a two day period at the end). Now, the other piece: I had purchased another Siamese upon learning of my other cats' illness, and he not only loved them, he also loved the Natural Balance food, which was all he got. I noticed that as he grew he was not anemic looking as most siamese are, but actually had good muscle tone. When I brought him for his first vet checkup the vet said, and I quote ""In 20 years, this is the healthiest looking Siamese cat I have ever seen."" She commented on his physique, muscle tone, activity level, coat, etc. I later adopted a Tabby the same age as the Siamese, and got the same response. Both cats just have sleek, beautiful coats, are very athletic and energetic, and love the Natural Balance food. I firmly believe that this food (and I now also use Blue Buffalo Wilderness for some variety) has made a real and noticeable differnce in the health and quality of life of my cats, and I highly recommend it to anyone. I will say my cats don't care for the wet Natural Balance foods, so I supplement their diet with an occasional Fancy Feast flavor that is free of glutens and fillers (you can Google for the list. Highly recommended. Addendum 4/12/10: My cats have changed their minds about the NB wet food and really enjoy it now. The key is to switch around the flavors. Addendum 4/22/11: have since adopted two more shelter cats, one a snowshoe siamese, the other a sable burmese. After each being on Natural Balance for about five months, the Snowshoe has a fur coat that is silky and beautiful; the little Burmese has a sleek shiny coat. Both have loads of energy. Again the vet was amazed at their coats and muscle tone, as was the vet tech. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
" UPDATE 07/12:  OMG, this is AWESOME!!!! Finally a really good alternative to high fat peanut butter",5,"Guys: Although this may not have the exact taste of a typical commercial brand peanut butter out of the jar, it is VERY CLOSE. THIS IS THE ONE THAT SATISFIES A CRAVING FOR CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER without all the fatty oil.. It has no chemical or weird aftertaste (it's the most peanut-nutty tasting alternative out there which I've tried), and you really can adjust the consistency based on the amount of liquid you add. Although I previously favored the ""Better-n-Peanut Butter"" brand sold here N Peanut Butter, Better N Peanut Butter, Orig Lf, 16.00 OZ (Pack of 12) and at Trader Joe's (which needs no mixing or preparation and has a real peanut butter texture), I must admit that the taste of ""better n peanut butter"" is not nearly as good as PB2 ( ""Better n Peanut Butter"" is less peanut-y and does have an odd sort of after taste) and it needs to be refrigerated after opening or it gets moldy (trust me.....yuck). Anyway, back to this product:PB2. It has a very good peanut buttery taste and if you're cooking with it or mixing it in drinks or smoothies (like a banana smoothie), the texture is a non-issue. And having it in these 1 lb packages makes it much more affordable than buying the small jars sold here or directly from PB2's website (where they add $10 shipping). And if you get at least three bags at Superstore, it qualifies for free shipping (it works out to about $8.70/lb). I also ordered the chocolate which is also good (not a strong chocolatey taste, more like a hint of cocoa), but my favorite is still the plain PB2. ***UPDATE*** Guys: I just tried another product from Byrd Mill and searched under peanut flour product (basically peanut butter with the oils removed as well) that's also very good (it's cheaper than the PB2 product here if you buy the 5 1lb. option....I ordered -1- 5 lb bag and the total price with shipping was approx. $32.65 (therefore about $6.50/lb). The package comes in about 4 days after you order, but the one negative is that it is not vacuum sealed. It's in a plastic bag with a twisty tied around it and then placed in a large paper bag with a folding top (the kind of bag that coffee beans come in, but bigger). In order to keep it fresh, I use about 1 lb. at a time and then vacuum seal the rest. They also sell larger and smaller quantities at slightly steeper discount with little change in shipping. You have an option of getting a dark roast (more peanut-y) or light roast (less peanut-y tasting) and either 28% fat left in (at 6g/serving) or 12% (at 3g fat per serving). I buy the dark roasted, 12% fat. It is definitely more peanut-y than PB2 and is smoother and creamier in texture. The only big difference from the PB2 product (which I prefer, others may not....) is that Byrd Mill does not have any salt and sugar added (it's just pure roasted de-fatted peanut flour) so you'll most definitely want to add a little salt (maybe even a little honey) to the mixture to suit your taste if your using it plain (like on a sandwich, or with crackers or right on a spoon. So if you find yourself snacking on peanut butter every day to satisfy your peanut butter cravings, go ahead and try this. …",90 out of 94 users found this review helpful

 Healthy Alternative for Working Moms,5,"I give props to any mom, especially one that holds down a full time job or two, that can puree and strain her own food. If that's you, hat's off. You're my hero. I'm no superhero, so my goal was to find the best quality, best tasting food with minimal processing. Let's face it, there are plenty of organic options out there. And these days, I think most of them are good. The little man likes the Gerber organics fruits. They're easy to find and inexpensive. But hands down, the Happy Baby products are the best quality, best tasting (in my opinion) and most convenient of them all. The pouches are great, especially for when we're on the go. We can eat the fruit varieties without even putting on a bib. The Chick Chick is the man's favorite (bib required). The negative is that they're about twice the price of the Gerber fruits and meats. So if you're on a budget, this may be a bit of a stretch. Nonetheless, keep some pouches around for when you travel. Baby will love them! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 such great treats!,5,"I give these to my dog to help with her minor tartar problems. She LOVES them and they definitely do the job. One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up. …",23 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Your happiness will depend on your sensitivity to artificial sweeteners,3,"I recently bought a Sodastream Genesis for the purpose of creating my own club soda. It's a great machine. As an additional experiment, I've tried a few of the flavors from this sampler pack, and I've been rather disappointed with the results. Even the _non diet_ flavors are sweetened with Splenda, and the soda leaves a strange aftertaste in my mouth. If you're used to diet soda, you're likely to find these flavors quite delicious. However, if you're really sensitive to artificial sweeteners, you might want to pass on Sodastream's regular and diet flavorings. (Their website provides nutrition information on all of their flavors, so you can check to see what sweetener is used in each flavoring.) …",60 out of 66 users found this review helpful
 Excellent product,5,"My primary reason for buying this product was to help my digestive system. I have iron deficiency anemia, but I could not tolerate any brand of iron supplement, and the shots were extremely painful. So I became extremely anemic and needed transfusions. Consequently, I couldn't take a chance anymore on not using iron tablets and I had to find a way to take them without suffering. Because I use coconut oil and milk in my cooking and for skin/hair care, I've done research on the benefits of this amazing seed, and I thought that these capsules might help me to tolerate iron tablets. Well they have, and I am now able to tolerate 3 daily doses of ferrous sulfate, so I'm in compliance with my doctors orders and my hemoglobin level is rising. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Been using for 5 months...GREAT!!!,5,"It's been over two months since my original review in june...I was turned on to the benefits of acai back in december. As part of my new years resolution, I am drinking at least one spinach/fruit smoothie DAILY. For the last five months, I add one scoop of the Sambazon acai powder along with Green Vibrance powder to my smoothie. I am on my fifth jar of this stuff. I haven't felt this great since my 20's! My body has transformed dramatically, but NOT overnight. If you are looking for a miracle potion, it doesn't exist. However, I highly recommend acai powder with sensible diet/exercise. I have been using the Sambazon brand because it's not overpriced like Monavie, and is easy to add to my smoothie. The slightly bitter taste doesn't bother me and is not even noticable when mixed w/ fresh spinach, banana, mango, blueberry, strawberry, and rasberry. Results speak for themself: it is now early august...in 7 months I went from 165lbs to 140lbs of lean muscle. My skin has cleared up completely and I feel great.

 Still Amazing!!!,5,"I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet. The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch. With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now. My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you. Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that. I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra. It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge. Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me. And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant. ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!! Cheers!!!! P.S. ZICO is still amazing. …",13 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 This water is making a difference for me,5,"This water tastes good, and after drinking it for a few weeks, it has most certainly helped with my indigestion and acid reflux. I also feel like I can drink more of it without getting bloated than I did with Evian. It tastes smooth and does well at quenching my thirst, better than some other bottled waters I have tried. I have now subscribed to a couple of cases of this direct from Superstore each month, as the price per liter works out less than I was paying for Evian from the store on a regular basis, and with a subcription, the shipping is always free. Hard to beat that.

 What it is....,3,"As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying ""fresh"" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;) The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh. …",19 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 So Good why isn't it Bad???,5,"After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked **** hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend! The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else. First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right. Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches. It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the ""bowl"" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked. I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too. All in all, I highly recommend them! Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway. Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this! PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Superstore I've found a site called ""netrition "" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Superstore is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food. I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Superstore charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Superstore, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them. So like I said, Superstore is great for most things, but when it comes to food, Netrition is a whole lot better! …",26 out of 27 users found this review helpful

Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain.

" Good food, excellent value",4,"Overall, I think this is a good food and an absolutely amazing value as far as grain-free foods go. My cat certainly enjoyed it, I saw an improvement in her fur, and she became leaner and more active. On her prior diet of Science Diet Light (high carb, filler food - shame on me!) she was becoming fat and lethargic. The difference in feeding a grain-free, high protein food was almost immediate. My only problem with Taste of the Wild is that the amount of vegetables after the first ingredient (chicken meal) seems excessive. Too many pea proteins and potato proteins. The next meat ingredients, venison and salmon, don't appear until the sixth and seventh ingredient. Recently I decided to switch my cat to Orijen, which I believe is the very best dry cat food out there - the first 6 ingredients are all meats! Orijen, however, is also significantly more expensive. For those who are on a budget, I think Taste of the Wild is far better than the vast majority of commercial dry kibbles out there. Taste of the Wild is certainly better than the by-product and corn filler loaded (not to mention expensive) Science Diet that I fed my cat for the first 3 years of her life. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 NOT better in person.,2,"I was so excited when I found these cookies online, they were perfect for my sister's hello kitty themed birthday party, i was going to pass these out as favors. When I received them, I was less than thrilled. They are defintely a lot cuter online. I wasn't expecting them to be perfect (after all they are just cookies), but I wanted them to be made with more care/time. In the entire box, there are about 3 that I like. The rest it looks like someone made them very quickly. About 90% of the black outline of the face are jagged as if they did it on purpose, but only a select few have a nice smooth outline like in the picture. Many of the faces have tons of black marks from the black frosting, but the marks are extrememly noticeable on the white face and I'm embarrassed for the people who end up with a MESSED UP LOOKING HELLO KITTY. Also, many of the pink bows are mixed with black so much that it bothers me. I am not a picky person, but when I order Hello Kitty cookies, I expect them to be done decently. I am a person who makes things for parties and I put a lot of time and detail into my work. Next time, I will make these myself. Such a disappointment. I had high hopes for this item. Oh well. If you want to order these for a party and don't really care what they look like, then go for it, but if you want them to pass out as favors, I would suggest you think of something else.

 Great salt,5,"This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a ""rounded"" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Review on TASTE,5,"I'm writing this review, because it's exactly the kind of review I was looking for before I bought this product, but could not find anywhere. When I first started using Natural Calm I bought it in the Raspberry-Lemon flavor, thinking it sounded the best and used it with water (usually just put it inside a water bottle and shook it up to mix it and drank it that way). Both me and my husband used it and HE really liked the taste, but for me this stuff tasted BAD. I don't know why, but I did not like the taste at all. I guess some people do (obviously my husband did or at least didn't mind it) but I definitely did not. It made drinking it everyday a CHORE. So, this next time I decided to try the one that isn't flavored and I like it SO MUCH better, like a million times better. I just mix it in with my blueberry-pomegranate juice and it's great! It is virtually tasteless and just adds a little 'fizz' to the juice that I actually LIKE. I also put it in teas as well. I wanted to write this review just to let people know that not everyone loves the raspberry-leomon flavor (and I didn't think I'd like the orange to begin with, but haven't tried it yet and probably never will). There are a lot of reviews claiming it tastes great... but for me not so much. I recommend the flavor-less one. Also, be careful when starting out to use the recommendation on the bottle and start with 1/2 a teaspoon a day and then work up from there. :-) I never had any negative side effects, but I guess some people get diarrhia if they take too much in the beginning. This stuff really is amazing and will help you feel GREAT! :-) If you're thinking about trying it don't hesitate. It has many, many benefits. You might just be using it to help with mood or to help with ADHD/concentration, or just for a natural way to keep from becoming constipated... There are MANY benefits. But no matter what you're using it for, it's bound to help out your body and mood in other ways as well! :-) Can't say enough good things about this product! Just try to get the flavor-less one first, it's so much better!! I hated having to drink it when we had the raspberry-lemon one. But now I definitely don't, and like the little fizz it gives my blueberry-pomegranate juice & teas! :-) Drinking it right now and loving it! And loving the way it makes me feel and the concentration it gives me! …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 OK but bottled juice is better,3,"When I mix up the concentrate, at the lower recommended amount it is weak and not sweet enough. It is better if you add more of the concentrate, but it still has a bit of an off-taste compared to tart cherry juice that I get in glass bottles at Whole Foods.

 Mild sweet tea,5,I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose. Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth. I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea. Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening. …,24 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 My Dog Loves This Food,4,"I have a 12 year old golden retriever. I have been feeding him Happy Hips treats for almost a year hoping the glucosamine helps with his arthritis. He eats the treats like crazy. I like the fact they are apple, banana, chicken and sweet potato. They are healthier than store bought treats. I have the same hope for the chicken & oats dry dog food. This dog food came the other day, I cut the bag open to dump it into a plastic tub and by mistake I tipped it over a little and some of it went scattered all over the floor. Well, my dog with the arthrtis jumped right up and cleaned up the floor in no time, tried sticking his head in the bag and then wagged his tale licking my face. If this is as good as the treats, I know it will help with his arthritis. Superstore is the cheapest I have found for this food, plus the free shipping is a bonus. I bought mine when Superstore had a 20 percent promotion so it was an added bonus. Thanks Dogswell and Superstore. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Inedible Dried Fruit,1,"I bought whole bunches of different types of dried fruit, including these dried cherries. I always read the product descriptions very carefully. I suppose the cherries met the product description, but they could not give me any help on the taste. These and many other dried fruits offered on Superstore were terrible in taste. I've had such good results with return of items for refund that I never even wondered if, for these cherries, Superstore has a firm policy to not accept returns, to make no refunds. Now that I think about that, I agree. Food is an item that could be adulterated by a evil-thinking customer, then returned. We would not want a 'returned food item' to eat. I complained and got a curious letter of apology from a real person and the data that she had authorized a ""apology payment"" to me for some $60. I sent her a very nice thank you, only to have it return with the notice that I had replied to a ""no reply"" address. I will never buy any food item from Superstore.

 Not Really K-Cups But They Do Fit in Your Keurig,3,"Don't be alarmed when you receive these and they don't look like a standard K-cup. These are not K-cups, but dowill fit in your machine. I thought I had ordered the wrong product at first. These simply have a plastic ring at the top so that they'll fit in your K-cup holder and the rest of it is like a standard coffee filter. I've only tried Fog Chaser (ordered all 3 flavors) and was surprised that I liked the coffee. However, because it's using a filter rather than the K-cup technology, it does leave a sediment in the bottom of your cup. I find this also happens when using the My K-Cup filter with whatever brand of coffee I use. You will need to store the ""k-cups"" in a ziploc to keep them fresh. The 36-count come packaged in 3 plastic bags of 12 each. This is nice so that you only have to open up one 12 pack at a time so the others can stay fresh.

" You Can Blame It On The Gravy, I Guess",1,"My apologies to all who give this particular Hormel Compleats good reviews. I've tried several in the Compleats line, gobbling all six in the box myself. This is the very worst of all I've sampled. Really sorry. Please remember, these all are personal opinions. The chicken is tasteless; but would be so-so when compared to most Compleats. The dressing is...well, I don't know really how the dressing tastes because any flavor is ""compleatly"" wiped out by the true culprit in this disaster..... That would bring us to the gravy, or whatever they call that stuff on top. I don't know how the good folks at Hormel accomplished this; but they produced a substance that not only is tasteless in itself, but draws flavor from everything around it. That had to be quite an accomplishment, scientifically; but not good, gourmet-wise. Certain brands of glue might be better, I'm afraid. At least you could taste them. While doing this, let me again apologize to the dressing. Just too much gravy to have any idea what it might be like. …",17 out of 20 users found this review helpful
" "" A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!""",5,"I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try ""Natural Calm""; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot. I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because ""Natural Calm"" does the job. I've been taking ""Natural Calm"" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff. As for negatives to ""Natural Calm""...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick. All in all 5+ stars. ""Natural Calm"" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer. …",39 out of 47 users found this review helpful

 ***Miraculous!***,5,"Before trying this miraculous product, I had been happily nursing my second daughter for 9 months with no problems. Then I got my first postpartum period and my milk supply was down to almost nothing. My daughter was miserable, biting me and crying at every nursing session and quickly ended up constipated. For a week I was nursing constantly, pumping and drinking over a gallon of water a day to increase my supply, with increased frustration being the only result. I was devastated and my daughter refused formula in bottles and sippy cups except when she was asleep. I knew I had to either wean or find a miracle! I googled my issue and learned about a few products that could possibly help. I can't swallow pills so fenugreek wasn't an option but this tea sounded totally doable. I ordered the pack of 6 with overnight shipping for only an extra $3.99 with my Superstore Prime benefits. To brew the tea, I pour 8oz. of boiled water over the tea bag and cover the cup with a saucer and let it sit for a minimum of 10 minutes. Then I dunk the tea bag 15 or so times and then gently squeeze it to extract every last bit. When I tried my first cup, I hated it. It tasted like musty, minty licorice. I have a sensitive stomach so I thought there was no way I'd be able to drink it. Adding honey didn't help but just a bit of sugar made it taste okay. My second cup was a little bit better and by the third cup, I genuinely liked the taste of it! I drink 4 cups a day and now I actually crave it! The first day of use I didn't notice any increase in my milk supply but I did smell a bit like maple syrup, which my husband actually likes. When I woke up the next morning my breasts felt slightly fuller, but not much of a difference. I again drank 4 cups that day, waking up the next morning with fuller breasts and enough milk to sustain my daughter's thirst. And the next morning? I woke up practically engorged! I have been enjoying 4 cups of this miraculous, soothing product everyday for almost 2 weeks now and my daughter and I are both so thrilled and grateful.

When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee. Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about. When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing. Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe. My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day. Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one. It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.

 Title is a little misrepresentative,5,"Assorted Green Tea Flowers should be called Assorted Jasmine Green Tea Flowers. It's the blooms that are assorted not the tea flavor. They are all Jasmine. Having said that, it's a wonderful surprise when you put in the bud and don't know what kind of flower you're going to be getting next! Usually when I buy Jasmine Tea I get the finest- A small 4 ounce bag that runs me $20 and although this tea isn't as good as what I regularly buy it's still very nice tasting. The best part is that it's practically impossible to overbrew. Jasmine Tea in particular can get really bitter easily if it is overbrewed even a bit and I was afraid I would have to take the flower out after a couple of minutes to stop the brewing process. But NO! The makers thought ahead and made it so that you can leave the flower in and it won't overbrew. The only bad thing about this is that if you like your Jasmine Tea really strong then you won't like the way this works for you. But strong Jasmine Tea is always bitter so you might want to try a lighter brew like this. Hint: If you never liked the way Jasmine Tea tasted because of it's bitterness here's a trick. Standard instructions for Jasmine include having your water at around 180 degrees and brewing for aprox 2 minutes. Instead of this, try using a lower temperature instead- say 130ish and brew for 7 minutes. What you'll get is a tea with all the Jasmine and none of the bitterness. With these flowers however you don't have to worry about brewing time (unless you like your tea VERY weak) and are free to enjoy the flower until your tea is gone. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Discovery of the Century!,5,"When I found out I was pregnant with my first child, I read in a baby magazine about the wonderful health benefits of Chia seeds. They are packed with Omega-3 fatty acids, and because healthy brain function is nurtured by Omega-3 fatty acids, I wanted to supplement my diet with something other than fish oil pills that can pack a fairly unpleasant aftertaste. These seeds are so tiny, and so flavorless, that you can mix them into cereal, or even juice, without ever realizing you have consumed them. I have also found that adding these seeds to my breakfast keeps me fuller longer. Chia seeds are more convenient than flax seeds, and a pound of them, costing around $12 (depending on the seller), lasts a few months. If you want to avoid the potential unpleasantness of fish oil supplements, Chia seeds are a great alternative, and for new or expecting mothers, they are a great way to ensure your baby is getting what s/he needs for optimum brain health and development. Lastly, you do not have to be considering motherhood to consider adding Chia to your diet. It is a wonderful, all-natural supplement that is perfectly painless (in both taste and cost) to undertake. Who would have thought that the seeds responsible for the (infamous) ""Chia Pet"" would offer so much more than a gawdy table ornament? Highly recommended. …",97 out of 100 users found this review helpful
 Time saver!,5,"While I was waiting for my order to arrive, I used a steamer and a handmixer to make food for my baby. This was a pretty easy, hard to mess up process and I started having doubts whether or not I really needed a Baby Food Maker. Boy, was I wrong! The Baby Brezza saves me so much time! 1. it steams faster than a regular steamer (I think it's because the space is so compact, the steam gets right to the veggies/fruits) 2. I don't have to be around the kitchen after I fill up the container. Just set the time and walk away! And wait for the beeping sound. With the regular steamer, you'll have to set a timer or keep coming back regularly to the kitchen to check if the food is ready. 3. The machine itself can automatically blend the food for you. Once again, you don't have to be around the kitchen after the food is steamed. Just stay away and wait for the beeping sound. With a regular steamer, the food has to be moved to the measuring cup before you can blend it with the handmixer (and wait for it to cool down). The accessories work perfectly along with the product. The machine is very easy to operate. I couldn't have asked for more...I'm happy! Yes, a regular steamer and handmixer can do the job too, but if you appreciate the freedom of not having to monitor the food being steamed or blend, buy the Baby Brezza! …",70 out of 72 users found this review helpful

 What Do You Mean I Can't Bring My Milk???,5,"I approached the Airport Security Gate and fed my bags into the x-ray machine. ""Sir,"" said the TSA agent, ""is this your bag?"" ""You know it is,"" I replied. ""There's no need to get testy sir,"" he said. The agent escorted me over to a side table. ""Do you mind if I search your bag?"" he asked. ""What will you do if I say no?"" I asked. ""I'll take you in the back room and we'll strip search you,"" he replied. ""Then by all means, go ahead and search,"" I said. The agent opened my bag and peered inside. ""What do you call this sir?"" the agent asked holding up a pair of nail clippers. ""Those are nail clippers,"" I said. ""I'm going to have to confiscate these,"" he said. ""That's alright,"" I replied, ""they sell them for a dollar in the store next to my departure gate."" The agent looked at me with hate in his eyes. He looked back into my bag and pulled out my gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk. ""Sir, you can't take this on the plane,"" he said. ""Why not?"" I asked. ""Because, if you have more than three ounces of a liquid you could use it to blow up the plane,"" he said. I was astonished. I had no idea that Tuscan Whole Milk was so powerful. ""May I drink it now?"" I asked. ""Yes,"" he said, ""liquids are harmless once they are inside of you."" I drank the entire gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk that I had purchased on Superstore while the people behind me grew increasingly inpatient. It was delicious.

 Great Energy Mix but price is too high!,4,"I have a similar product that I purchased at Wal-Mart for less than $5 for 19.25 oz., so this price is way too high. The product currently comes with 20% free, so it probably is usually available in a 16 oz. size. The product that I purchased is called Ann's House ""Good Health Energy"", but it appears to be a similar mix of soynuts, cranberries, almonds and pumpkin kernels.

When I first got him the breeder had him on Purina Puppy Chow.

 Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on,5,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups. I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive. I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products. If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :) EcoBrew VS Solofill First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew. Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker. These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable! I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product. The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly. …",559 out of 562 users found this review helpful
 Superior quality food -,5,"After many fits and starts, I 've totally switched my two Flat coated Retrievers to Orijen. Fantastic quality food and although price per pound is higher in reality w/o the cereal and other fillers of so many other dog foods, its actually only nominally more expensive. I weaned my K-9s (ages 2 and 6) off other commercial foods and have found their stools now on 100% Orijen are normal, not odorous (during the transition there is some how do we say ""stink"" as this food contains beneficial probiotics that initially are dealing with the grain based old foods in the K-9s digestive tract). Also my k-9s sleep inside at night and travel quite bit with me to training and searches - nothing worse than a dog flatulance and there is none and I mean none of that with this food Yeah! My K-9s are my Search and Rescue partners and this has given them excellent stamina, better coats and they both relish it. I'm using New Zealand dried lamb bits for training and reward treats but occasionnally use just a few Orijen kibbles instead and you would think I was serving them prime rib. Wish I could find a local vendor in RI - shipping is a little steep but many of the vendors will offer you a significant discount on the second order so I order two bags at a time and change-up the flavors from time to time so the K-9s don't get jaded. Can't say enough how pleased I am with food. …",48 out of 49 users found this review helpful
 Great Bar!,5,"Though it's now out of vogue, I'm still a fan of a healthy version of the low carb Atkins style diet. This is the perfect meal bar for that diet (probably great for South Beach, too). It is delicious, the peanut butter is creamy, and the chocolate on the outside is superb. I've used the Atkins bars for years, and they taste of chemicals and artificial sweetners. These Think Think bars, though, are practically candy bars. They have low net carbs (2 for this version, I think). Even when I'm not dieting, I still love this bar. It isn't a large, filling bar, and I can't really eat one to replace a meal, but if you're looking for a snack to cut between meals, or just a desert to eat with a nice cup of coffee at night, this is the bar for you. This price on Superstore can't be beat, either. I pay about $1.7 per bar at Trader Joes, 2.20 a bar at the local megamart (when they have them in stock), and only about a buck fifty here on Superstore. Great deal. I was kind of sketchy ordering food online (though I order everything eles online), but Superstore grocery proved me wrong. Give 'em a try. …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Strong and with a kick but....bitter and defective cups,1,"Taste.. 3 stars. Yes, strong with a kick, but to my taste buds very, very bitter. Might be the guarana but the bitterness is very difficult to overcome regardless of brew cup size (I've tried 5,7 and 9 ounces so far). I like the smoothness and strength of Kona and the strength of Revv does equal that of the Kona but it is not smooth. I occasionaly add hazelnut non-dairy creamer as a sweet treat to my coffee and the bitterness still comes through over the hazelnut creamer. My latest on the go experiment that seems to make it more palate tolerant, is brewing 7 ounces of Revv and adding 5 ounces of a milder medium roast coffee to it in the travel cup. It still has the bite, but with a reasonable amount of sweetner the bitterness seems to be dulled to an acceptable level. K-cup container 1 star if not less. I've made 5 cups of this coffee, The 5 K-cups I've used today have had the lids come unsealed during brewing, resulting in a god awful mess of coffee flowing around the K-cup holder, out all gaps in the brewer itself and coffee grounds all over the place, in the coffee, in the brewer, in the K-cup holder. I've used lots of K-cups from every one (haven't tried Wolfgang Puck's products yet) and have never had a K-cup unseal like this before. I'll not be ordering more of these. …",15 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Saving Whisper's Life!,5,"Update: 3-9-12 Tomorrow marks the six-month anniversary of Whisper's attack. It's hard to wrap my mind around that with an objective perspective. He's going to get steamed salmon filet to celebrate, and I will celebrate by trying to continue to spread the word about this wonderful tea! As I mentioned earlier, there is a bulk package available through Superstore that makes 14 gallons for $70.00. The bulk essiac came yesterday. It is in four packets of ingredients, with 2lb burdock root, 1lb sheep sorrel, 4oz slippery elm and one ounce Turkish rhubarb root. Those are the ingredients in both my books on making it yourself. The Flora product also includes kelp,blessed thistle and red clover, none of which other than red clover are mentioned in either book that I have read, although they suggest adding a bit of bloodroot for hard cancers. I should be able to accurately measure out portions to brew whatever amount I like at a time. I'm probably going to try for two quart batches and see how long that carries Spirit and me. Whisper will remain on the Flora product. I can be pretty scientific about the preparation, but I'm going to quote an Ojibwah medicine man from ""Essiac, A Native Herbal Cancer Remedy"" by Cynthia Olson. ""I use a big handful of chopped, dried burdock root (My hands are kind of big. This weighs about 3 ounces.). Then I use a big handful of sheep sorel. This weighs about 1 ounce. Then I use big pieces of dried rhubarb root, amounting to about 1/2 ounce (I use bige pieces so the laxative effect is not boiled away). Then I add a wad of slippery elm (inside bark) about the size of a golf ball. This won't move most scales (about 1/18 of an ounce). This makes about one week's supply, so boil in one gallon of water, then let it soak overnight, strain it in a one gallon apple juice jar and store in your fridge. Drink one 8 ounce cup twice a day. More if you feel like it. Don't dillute it. That some whimpy white man's health food store thinking. It tastes kind of thick and slippery. If you heat it, do it in a small saucepan on a burner. Don't ever use a microwave or it will be useless. By the way, when you drink it, pray that your body will get back in harmony with The Great Spirit."" I think this may be the best way for me to prepare it, although I will probably see what my particular hand measurements amount to. Also, it looks as if everything in the packets is pretty well powdered, so it may force me into weight measurements. I like the medicine man's philosophy. Also, since for spirit and me, it is more for purification than ""cure"" (knock on wood!), we will probably take a couple of ounces per day, each...we'll see what the results are and adust it. I'll keep you posted. Six-month portraits of Whisper will follow! Update: 1-31-12 I've added two more photos of Whisper, taken this evening. I don't have much to add, other than the fact that his blood-work is normal, and I continue to give him daily doses of Essiac tea. I will always do anything to keep Whisper and Spirit in my life, as long as theirs have quality. I can ask for no more the joy they give me daily! Update: !2-4-11 A picture is worth 1,000 words, and if you look at the photos I just uploaded, you will see two sweet critters who are the pictures of health!!! Update: 10-26-11 Whisper continues to thrive! I have not seen him act so playfully for a couple of years, at least. He is happy, accessible and loving. His appetite is very good. He threw up once the week before last, which was scary. The vomit was dark brown and the consistency of espresso coffee. Although it was unnerving, he seemed fine afterward. It was a single incident, and may have been part of the process of his body purifying itself. Spirit has not needed Rimadyl and continues to be extremely playful. I have been taking a couple of ounces per day a couple of days a week, and even at low-dose, I feel more energetic. Tonight I added photos of the brewing process. It isn't the simplest thing in the world, but it takes about fifteen minutes of your actual attention. Remember, the Drs at the emergency hospital told me Whisper had only days...or weeks, at best before he would die. When he came home, I had almost no hope. Yesterday, I received my second box of tea. We haven't consumed all of the first. I've given a portion of it to friends who also have animals with serious illness. We live in a toxic world, and Big Medicine will try to separate us from our money by nuking us with toxic chemicals and procedures while draining our money if we let them. There are viable alternatives. Essiac Tea is one of the most potent, but there is also colloidal silver as an antibiotic that is gentle, effective and works over and over, unlike prescription products. Olive leaf extract also fights many infections safely, and for UTIs, try Usnea and Uva Ursi tincture. Just those few remedies, with the recent addition of the essiac tea, have kept me disease-free for years. Don't forget to eat healthy food, never smoke, and if you drink, do so moderately. Exercise daily, drink water, and thank the earth for all of the tools we have to keep healthy naturally. I will update this review as the treatment progresses. So far, so much better than I had hoped! Original Review: On September 10th, 2011, my 12-year old cat, Whisper suddenly became near death. I had seen him about 4:00 and he seemed fine. At 6:30 I went to find him to give him his supper and I found him in the bathroom with his belly inflated to the size of a volleyball, a look of horror on his face, and screeming weakly. I rushed him to the local animal emergency hospital, and by the time I got him there he was almost gone. They rushed him to their ER, relieved the pressure and got him on multiple IVs. The next day, they did extensive tests and determined that he has aggressive lymphoma. I was devastated. I had lost his sister, Shadow, in June to a different attack, apparently from the same cause. The vet who came to euthanize her said she thought that a large lymph gland in her abdomen had ruptured and caused a huge infection which was untreatable. In Whisper's case, they told me that with chemo, he might have weeks, and without it, he probably had days. They managed to get him stable enough to take home with steroids and a special compounded prescription to restore function to his bowels, but the prognosis was grim. A friend of mine who had a cat who was diagnosed with a hard-tumor cancer, given two months to live and when put on essiac tea, lived 18 months and passed peacefully of heart failure told me about this brand and recommended I try it. I ordered it, and by the time it arrived, although he was still alive, he had become anorexic, lethargic, and I really didn't think it would do any good. He also had caught an upper respiratory infection in the hospital. I gave him his first four doses with an irrigating syringe, and he started eating again, coming out socially and began taking it with juice from canned salmon. Now, just over a month since he was released and three weeks into the tea protocol, he takes two doses with salmon juice and he and my dog, Spirit, who I found out at the same time had a mass on his rectum, both get it in one of their water dishes to drink during the day. Whisper has gotten back to his old sweet, loving, playful personality, has a great appetite, and plays like a kitten, running to me like a puppy! Spirit has responded to the point that I can't locate the mass. I've been able to take him off Rimadyl. He was starting to have soreness after hikes and play. He can travel up the stairs with no problem, jump into the back seat of our SUV, and doesn't have the risk of upset stomach he had with Rimadyl. This is amazing stuff! If I ever develop cancer, I will use it first, and ignore chemo and radiation therapies. Until now, I had simply believed when cancer was diagnosed, it was going to get you someday, somehow...sooner or later. With essiac tea, I believe we have an amazing weapon, which, if it doesn't outright cure it, works better than anything I have ever seen with anyone or any animal diagnosed with cancer and from reports I have read may actually cure soft cancers such as lymphoma. I don't know how advanced Whisper's is, but I have seen pretty much miraculous changes in him over the shortest of times. I will update this review as we continue using the tea, but in three short weeks, I have come from feeling despair and huge grief to believing he may be with me for a very long time! I bond to my animals almost as much as my daughter, and I am still not over Shadow's passing. If I had lost Whisper, I don't know what would have happened to me emotionally or spiritually. Over the last fifteen years I have lost nearly everyone of importance in my life except my daughter, and I am saturated with the pain of loss. Essiac tea has already bought me more time than I expected to have with Whisper and the fact that he has become so vital again in such a short time gives me hope that we will be together for a long time to come! I will update this review as I watch Whisper's progress, but right now this may be the best $25.00 I ever spent! It cost me almost $3,000.00 to find out what he had and stabilize him. If I had known about this when Shadow passed, I would have started him on it prophylactically. If you or a loved one are suffering from any form of cancer, please try this. It's a bit of a project to brew, but worth every penney and every ounce of effort! …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 good cereal but complaint about subscribe and save.  so 1 star for bad service.,1,"Ok. So why the one star. Well Superstore ca canceled my subscription order when I got a good deal on it after I canceled it right after that is. Seems they don't wanna honor it also they deleted the order from my history without notice so I wont have records to back it up. It was for 5.50 or so during the sale after sub and save. I first bought them for 6.50 or so after s. s., They deleted it right before the 2nd delivery and me canceling on them for charging me the 8 dollar deal. Why do I want that. Yep always cancel order on them after getting the first shipment. They wont honor the lower price deals anymore if you get them. Well I did change my cc number so maybe they had a error and just wants an excuse to not honor their contract, who knows. But dont I would not trust s. s. There is always a catch in good deals. It's a bait and switch. Obviously like all the retailers. They hate careful consumers. A knowledgeable consumer is retailers worse nightmare.:P Well same old corporation ways. Anyway Now for the cereal review. Pretty decently healthy and tasty for regular cereals . But like all processed foods the stuff they use is processed so the canola oil/veg oil they use is **** and then extra sugar etc. If you do care then try to buy the natural organic cereals, of course even though they take less work they charge more. lame yes less work more pay because there is less supply. Well this is great and cheap as long as you just want processed food and is less than 11 cent per oz. Otherwise I'll just get it from my local supermarket since its about the same price when on sale. …",1 out of 17 users found this review helpful
