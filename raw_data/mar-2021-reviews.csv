 The Premier Hotsauce.,5,"I first ran across Sriracha (and am still uncertain how to pronounce it) while eating at a Vietnamese restaurant in California. It was given to me with a seafood entr&eacute;e and I found that I kept squeezing the bottle and tasting the sauce separately with my fork. Its flavor is absolutely amazing. Yes, the other reviewers are quite correct, it is not a conveyer of great heat, but its texture and flavor are incomparable. I brought it back with me to Illinois and have about 6 of them in a cabinet--just in case I ever run short. I've turned at least 5 people onto it and now use it with chicken, pizza, and even eggs on a daily basis. It is exquisite and I've very glad to have made its acquaintance. …",31 out of 31 users found this review helpful
 Keurig K-Cups Cause Keurig Coffee Maker Problems,1,"We are on our third Keurig Coffee Maker. The original model has worked well for three years, although it's internal timer has given out. (We just turn it on and off) The second and third machines were the B70 Platinum, and worked well for about 9 months, at which point they either refused to pump water through the K-Cup altogether, or ""short cupped"" us by pumping some of the water back into the reservoir. Keurig replaced the first, and the replacement began to act up in December. After two hours on the phone today with both Keurig and Green Mountain Coffee, their K-Cup division (Timothys, Tullys, Newman's, Caribou, etc.) it turns out that some K-Cups get ""domed"" because the ""coffee is so fresh."" (The dome is apparently caused by gases emitted by the coffee grounds, creating a slight overpressure - bold coffees appear to be most susceptible to this phenomen.) When a ""domed"" K-cup is placed in the machine in accordance with the manual, however, the upper needle, which includes the water channels, can be clogged by grounds forced up into them by this internal overpressure condition. Keurig claims to have just discovered the problem and to be developing a solution, but in the interim, they advise puncturing the bottom of a ""domed"" K-Cup first by forcing it down on the lower needle before closing the top. If the machine is already clogged, their recommended technique is a paper clip to ream out the water channels, then running water (without a K-Cup) into a measuring cup to verify that the various cup settings are producing the correct volume of water. (None of this is addressed in the manual.) We've been buying the K-Cups from Superstore in bulk because of their good price, but have lately had two boxes of mostly ""domed"" Timothys Extra Bold Rainforest Expresso, which seem to have caused our difficulty. (Keurig claims that they've not had any problems with the smaller 24 count boxes which they market directly.) There is a ""best used by"" date on each K-Cup, and most of our ""domed"" K-Cups seem to either approaching or beyond their use by date, so ""caveat emptor"" when buying in volume from Superstore and other quantity purveyors of K-Cups, where the boxes may spend more time in the warehouse than otherwise . . . . …",36 out of 46 users found this review helpful
 Fantastic chips!!!,5,"I want to start out by saying that i thought at first that a bag with only 120 calories and 4 grams of fat (no saturated or trans) for every 20 chips was going to taste like ****. I must say that not only was i wrong, that this is my favorite BBQ chip on the market today. They are light and you cannot taste any fat or grease after eating them. That's because they aren't baked or fried, just popped as their name suggests. These chips are very easy to dip as well. FANTASTIC PRODUCT! …",33 out of 35 users found this review helpful
 Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!,5,"I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy. The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes. My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical. Obviously, my experience made me a believer! I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands. And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Not so healthy chemical additives,1,"This product contains yellow prussiate of soda, an anti-caking agent that is a regulated chemical that seems to be a concern when taken in high amounts. No surprise as it contains cyanide. It also affects what you can do with it in terms of pickling and brining. The USFDA CFR Title 21, v6 Sec 573.1020 regulates it in the following way -- notice that it doesn't say HUMAN consumption: The exact wording in the Code of Fed Regs is ""Yellow prussiate of soda...may be safely used as an anticaking agent in salt for animal consumption at a level not to exceed 13 parts per million. The additive contains a minimum of 99.0 percent of weight of sodium ferrocyanide decahydrate."" I bought this at the grocery store and am throwing it away. It may not be ""much"" in terms of contaminants from this single product (altho they COULD use food grade diatomaceous earth and have the same ""anticaking"" effect), but given we are being bombed with contaminants like this from all sides in our foods, every little bit of avoidance seems like the smarter option. I recommend you do not buy this salt -- look for Kosher salt options that do not have additives. If your salt cakes, you can easily crush it and add a spoon of diatomaceous earth (food grade) and mix it well -- this does a good job as well. The ""convenience"" of free-flowing kosher salt is not worth the added chemical ingestion... …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 A Great Cup of Joe: A Saeco Vienna Plus Super-Automatic Espresso Machine Review,5,"We owned a Saeco Vienna Deluxe since January 2004, but decided to purchase a newer model in September 2010. The Vienna Deluxe served us well for six and a half years, but was beginning to show its age. The Saeco Vienna Plus is the updated version of the Vienna Deluxe. Saeco's Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine is simple to use. Add up to 57 oz filtered cold water to the reservoir, up to 12 oz beans in the hopper, and then turn the machine on. While warming up, adjust the volume dial for a 1 to 6 oz pour. Once ready, press the coffee button once to make an espresso or twice for a double shot or two espressos. If a latte is desired, press the steam button after the espresso has finished brewing and turn the steam **** to activate the pannarello to steam the milk. Turning the steam **** without pressing the steam button will produce hot water from the pannarello instead. The perfect espresso may require adjusting a couple dials in the hopper. A strength dial controls the amount of grounds used per cup. A second **** controls the grind's coarseness. These settings are typically adjusted once then left alone if you chose to alter the factory setting. The factory settings work well for us, so we didn't adjust these controls. Maintaining and cleaning the Vienna Plus espresso machine is just as simple. Cleaning consists of a weekly (or after every 15 pucks) wipe down of the machine, rinsing off the brew group with warm water, and emptying and washing the drip tray and grounds drawer. Incidentally, the used coffee grounds are beneficial to soil when spread out in the gardens or lawn. Once every three months, running descaler through the boiler keeps the inner workings in good condition. A common complaint about Saeco Vienna espresso machines is the outer plastic cabinet. The durable plastic cabinet was not a problem for us on the old machine, as it didn't chip, crack, or break with normal use. The Veinna Plus uses the same plastic material for the outer cabinet, and is probably used to keep the cost down. The internal workings, like the stainless steel boiler, are hidden from view and use more expensive materials. Another complaint I've read about is the grinder getting clogged. Our local coffee shop advised us not to purchase oily beans like many flavored coffees. If you enjoy flavored coffee, add syrup to the cup instead. Choosing the right beans, and regular cleanings has kept us from experiencing this problem. Compared to the Vienna Deluxe, the Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine has an updated look, but operates the same and is similarly sized. However the Vienna plus is quieter, and the pannarello has been improved for easier and more consistent frothing. Ultimately, the Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine is simple to use and maintain; plus produces a great tasting espresso and Americano. If you're looking for a fully automatic espresso machine, this one is definitely worth considering. PROS: Fresh quality coffee made at the press of a button Makes consistently great tasting coffee/espresso Simple to use Easy to clean/maintain Biodegradable waste is great for the garden CONS: This espresso machine is sure to spoil its owners Cannot handle large quantities quickly …",25 out of 27 users found this review helpful

" Average flavor, but....",4,"I try to support anything USA made and especially businesses that are ""doing the right thing."" IMHO this honey has so special flavor or texture, in fact it crystallizes even when stored unopened. But I like the fact that it supports bee populations in a healthy locale. With the plight of the declining bee as it struggles to survive we need environments such as this to ensure the bee and our agriculture systems survive. So for that reason and since it is raw and unfiltered, I will continue to buy this product. Other honeys you may want to try that are sold on AMZN are Cal's Tupelo raw honey made in GA (incredibly good and smooth), and outside of the US consider Manuka Honey from New Zealand (amazing health benefits) and my very favorite is Bernard Michaud 1000 Flower Honey from the South of France. It is very expensive but truly heavenly and worth the price as a special treat. I use this one solely on toast or pastries or by the spoonful. At Tropical Traditions I buy their Canadian organic raw and unfiltered honey that in order to be somewhat cost effective, I buy it in a 15# pail that lasts a year. I use honey mainly during the fall and winter for constant tea sweetening (yes. I gain a few pounds) but I rationalize it's healthier than organic sugar and it supports bee farmers. …",19 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 Great cup of coffee,5,"I decided to give the San Francisco Bay Rainforest Blend Organic Arabica onecup a try this morning. When I open the box I notice a similar smell as the Fog Chaser blend but not nearly as strong. Oddly I find the description on the Box exactly the same as that of Fog Chaser. Their Website shows this as Reguler Full city Roast and describes it as follows : Our certified organic, Rainforest Blend is an artful mix of coffees from Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala, and Indonesia that produces a smooth, yet full-bodied taste with lively acidic notes. The onecup brews perfectly in my B70 and like it smelled befor brewing produced a more delicate cup than the fog chaser but still very flavorful when brewed. Maybe this is the same blend of coffee beans only roasted alittle lighter? The wife and I tend to favor the Dark Roast extra bold Kcups and on occasion Medium roasts as well. This Rainforest Blend is alittle light for me but it's really flavorful and wins me over all the same. So far I'm really liking these offerings from Rogers Family company and would purchase them again if the price remains competitive to Kcups. I was originally concerned by the fact they are not individually sealed for freshness. The wife and I normally drink 2 cups a day so we can polish off a box of 12 in three days once opened so the coffee does not lose much freshness. The downside is we need to drink only these for three days in a row instead of mixing it up depending on how we feel each day as we currently do with Kcups if we want to keep them as fresh as possible. …",78 out of 81 users found this review helpful
 Fun to make!,4,Ok So I saw a Video of this online and I was like Dang I really want to make this at home. So I bought it and Wow the shipping is fast. I've bought things from different countries and this shipping is fast considering that it's from japan. Well let me tell you about my experience with this candy. Making it is fun it takes about 10-15 mins. to make it and you can get the instructions in English from [...]. The best part was making the fish eggs. The texture of the fish eggs is cool because it is like a skin around the egg and liquid in the center. The rice smells like Sour apple and the fish eggs were sweet. The taste of the Fish gelatin (Red colored Gelatin) and the egg gelatin (The Yellow Colored Gelatin) was not too tasty. It felt weird and not normal in my mouth and wouldn't eat it again.

" Formula is fine, but I'm not so sure I'd call it ""Earth's Best""...",1,"... in fact it might just be the exact same formula as your closest local/national grocery store brand but with the added bonus of costing about 30% more. We had recently been using this formula until we ran out and I had to make an emergency run to the local grocery store for a quick replacement. The closest thing they had was their organic store brand. Funny thing is, when I got home to compare the two I noticed the ingredients are EXACTLY the same as well as some of the machine writing on the bottom of the cans where you can find the sell by date. From what I can gather after doing a bit of research the formula ingredients used to be different but have recently changed without letting customers know. Virtually all store brand organic formulas come from one manufacturing plant whether you buy it at store X or Y and it seems that Earth's Best is now being produced in this same facility but charging a premium price. I suggest checking this out for yourself, you might be able to save some money. …",12 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 BEWARE - Superstore LIMITS THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU CAN BUY,1,"The food is GREAT. The cats have gotten completely addicted to it.

Long story, and 2 phone calls plus 2 emails later, I was told I have bought the LIFETIME MAXIMUM of this product.

" Not gluten free.  Wow, in a bad way.",5,"Superstore won't let me take all the stars off, or I would. I had a really cool, Garrison Keillor-esque review of this up, complete with a discussion about how I made apple pie with this for Thanksgiving. What I didn't know yet, was that this is not, in fact, actually gluten-free. Then I got a nasty surprise--two days of gluten-symptoms. (The five non-celiac family members who very kindly had a gluten-free Thanksgiving with me didn't get sick at all.) I looked around online, and in some of the celiac forums--apparently Arrowhead Mills doesn't have dedicated, meaning 'gluten-free only', lines. So, this isn't gluten-free. It's not even close. Don't despair, though: there are other companies that had the same idea, specifically, The Gluten Free Pantry makes a basic flour mix with the same ingredients. I can't find anything online that says anyone has ever had a problem with them. (In fact, they are on Clan Thompson's recommended gluten-free list.) Clan MacDuffie over here thinks we'll go with them instead. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 A wonderful premium tea,5,"Yes, you are right. This tea is expensive. It is also quite marvelous. Right off the bat, I was impressed with the packaging of this tea. The tea comes packed in the correct kind of tin, with both outer and inner tightly fitting lids. When one pops out the inner lid, one is instantly rewarded with a waft of the wonderful scent of jasmine. Ah..... Heaven. Or, if not Heaven, at least a tropical garden at twilight. Now what's this? you might ask. This doesn't smell like the jasmine tea from the local Chinese takeout place. Yep. It sure doesn't. That's because this is The Real Deal. This tea is made up of whole baby tea leaves (""white tea"") and whole jasmine flowers. No raggedy bits and pieces of leaves and twigs were to be found anywhere. No jasmine ""flavoring."" No bitter aftertaste. Mmmmmmmmmmmm..... I carefully prepared the tea according to directions - one tablespoon of tea leaves per 8 oz. of water heated to 185 degrees. The directions said to steep the tea from four to five minutes, which seemed excessive to me, as I didn't want bitter tea. But in a real test, one must follow the directions, so I let the tea infuser sit in the water for a full five minutes. And I was rewarded. This is an utterly delightful tea, completely lacking the bitterness that can be associated with green teas. This tea is wonderful ""as is"" - no sweetener or milk should be added, in my opinion. The directions also stated that one tablespoon can be steeped ""multiple times."" Well, how many times is ""multiple?"" Good question. The first cup steeped was delightfully aromatic. The second cup less so, but still good. The third cup was rather pedestrian, the fourth cup just bland. Not bitter, not awful, just bland. I didn't try a fifth round of steeping. This is a tea best suited for someone who is going to want more than one cup of tea within a fairly short time span - if that is you, you will find there is a lot of bang for the buck with this product. All in all, I find this tea to be just wonderful. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
" Poor selection, terrible customer service",1,"The verbage on the ad read ""try 25 different flavors without buying 25 boxes!"" My bag (Yes, it was just a paper grocery sack with a bunch of k-cups tossed in) only had 10 different flavors.

I contacted Superstore Customer service, who was very helpful and directed me to the seller directly since Deals for You is a 3rd party seller. They emailed me back and said that they had just changed the ad, that when I ordered (a week prior) the ad didn't specify 25 different flavors (it did, I specifically checked that and ordered because of that promise). They then blamed the issue on Superstore, saying Superstore puts these orders together and they can't control it. So they lied to me, called me a liar, misrepresented their product, and then refused to do anything to make the situation right when it was called to their attention.

Looking at the ingredients should give you pause. After sea salt, the largest proportions are garlic, paprika and onion. As another reviewers have said, it hardly tastes at all like bacon. It's more like the dust you get at the bottom of a bag of Barbecue flavoured crisps. Perhaps my hopes were too high because of all the hype. Anybody who says a bacon imitation product tastes like bacon is talking out of their ****.

 I love these oats!,5,"These are the most delicious steel cut oats I have found, and they're certified to be gluten-free too! They're yummy and satisfying and give me long-lasting energy all morning. Since I'm always rushed in the morning, I put them in the pan at night and soak them in water. I use more water than the directions call for (maybe about four times as much water as oats). If you're going to add raisins, you can soak those right along with the oats. Then in the morning I just turn the heat on, bring them to a boil, cover and turn down to the lowest simmer. I like to cook them for 20 minutes, and they cook while I'm showering. They don't need to be stirred at all as long as you keep the heat really low and use plenty of water. Afterwards, I let them sit in the pan until I'm ready, and then before I eat them, I mix in a tablespoon of chia seeds.

 Nack,5,"5-Hour Energy Drink actually does work. If I am exhausted, it does not make me feel great, but it will get me through. It creates enhanced alertness, also seems to have a positive effect on eyesight and helps with tired eyes. It does take most of the ""awfulness"" out of being overly tired, and can make it possible to do the things I still need to do if the day is not over, even if I wish it were. The first time you take it, everything may seem ""brighter"" for a few moments (light sources may seem to ""pop"" slightly more than normal). This passes, and it feels like you were able to take a 90-minute power nap. For me, it lasts a bit less than the full 5 hours, but it is a very welcome boost. There really is no crash for me when it wears off, as advertised, and it does not make me feel ""wired"", just more alert. Not bad for something that comes in a little bottle for a couple bucks. As with all good things, be sensible, and if you choose to try it, use in moderation. I do not and would not use this every day, but it is nice to know it is there when needed from time to time. …",24 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 1 out of 2 dogs liked it!,4,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:42 Mins </span>Since neither of my 2 dogs can write about this new Lickety Stik, I will do my best. A new idea for treats is always welcomed. We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver. We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey. Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol). Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike. I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it. First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly. It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog. If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable. It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label. The video is one of our taste tests.

" The ""Chronic"" of Green Teas",5,"I recently took up drinking tea, green and white to be exact. As a newbie I started off with the commercial stuff like Lipton and Celestial Seasonings with pure tea bags. The taste was ok but In all honestly it didn't do anything for me. I began doing a bit of research and found that loose leaf tea was more potent and flavorful due to the fact that they use whole leaves rather than the ""dust"" leftover they use in tea bags. A bit more research brought me to Japanese green tea which recognized as the best of green teas in the world. I started off drinking Traditional Medicinals Japanese Bancha, then I started drinking their roasted Hojicha. While a bit better than your average Lipton Tea, I knew tea could be better. I started using loose leaf Sencha which was great and before long I came upon drinking Matcha. Matcha is great but it is frothy and mainly comes in powdered form for shakes, desserts or ice cream. Gyokuro on the other hand is the REAL DEAL. This stuff is truly what a green tea is all about. Very dark greenish bluish color with a strong pleasant aroma. The taste is pure and fresh and simply tastes like ""green tea"" and not grass. It only takes about 90 seconds steeping time and the brewing temperature just under boiling point. The color of the tea is a very bright clean looking green which tastes as good as it looks. I dare you to open a tea bag of Lipton, Traditional Medicinals or even loose leaf Sencha and compare alongside Gyokuro. You will laugh as the others look like trash compared to Gyokuro, I kid you not. I suggest any real green tea aficionado give it a shot; you wont be disappointed and I can assure you you will never go back to drinking anything less. It is expensive but so well worth it. Serendipitea is a great brand, Hoshino is the place for the best Gyokuro in Japan. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Ambrosia 16-Ounce Bottles,3,"Quick Look: Pros: 1) Packaged well 2) Light sweet flavor cons: 1) plastic bottle is very light material 2) Looks filtered 3) Quantity advertised is misleading We received the Ambrosia Pure Honey today. It came in a package with several items ordered and all four 10 oz bottles came wrapped together in a sealed plastic bag with bubble wrap inside the bag protecting the containers. The containers are very light duty. So much so that I thought I would break the container just twisting the cover off to get the foil protection removed. The honey came in the same large box from Superstore with metal tools I ordered so it might have been nice if the bag of honey bottles had been dropped into a separate small box as well. We immediately opened a bottle for a taste test. It has a very, very light honey flavor and color to it that is pleasant and very sweet. Though it says it is unfiltered it does look like it has been filtered to some degree. It is a little lighter than the picture displayed as well. Most of the honey producers we deal with list their honey in fluid ounces or in pounds. I was unfamiliar with this supplier but was intrigued by the area it comes from so, I bit without asking about the true weight. The conversion to weight makes a big difference in pricing. This advertiser states 16-Ounce Bottles. Well, each bottle is about 10 fluid ounces not 16 ounces as you might be led to believe. So if you thought it was 16 fluid ounces of honey and you just got 4 lbs of honey you just paid a premium for your honey because 4 bottles or 64 fluid ounces of honey should be 6 lbs. The advertisement should state 4 lbs. of honey. ""16-Ounce Bottles"" is misleading and maybe done so on purpose. If it doesn't say pint, quart or, pounds I guess the question needs to be asked up front about what we are buying. It makes one appreciate the Dutch Gold Company with their ""Bulk Orange Blossom Honey - 5 lb."" No mistake here and they have great packaging. Bottom Line :( I paid $4.39/lb verses $2.92/lb as I expected for this product due to the weight difference. Generally I try to keep the price to $3/lb and have received a good value from ""honeydabber"" on Ebay though the product comes in thermally sealed bags for that price. Dutch Gold Company through Superstore is straight forward about their weight as well but the product is pasteurized and filtered.

 The Truth About Vitamin C In Raw Cacao,5,"Hello Raw Cacao Lovers! Here is the real truth about vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content in Raw Cacao: Despite the trafficked reports circulating the internet, the honest truth remains: even when processed at low temperatures (i.e. ""raw""), there is no vitamin C (ascorbic acid) present in cacao. Recently, highly trafficked websites such as[...] have highlighted the misinformation of cacao's supposed vitamin C content. Included in these reports are claims that raw cacao is ""extraordinarily high in vitamin C."" Back in 2004, our Navitas Naturals lab tests directly looked for vitamin C content in raw cacao, but came up negative. Despite these results, the current media blitz brought us back again for another round of lab testing of our best-selling raw cacao products (beans, nibs and powder) for vitamin C. This time, we used two different laboratories instead of one, and utilized three different analytical methods: High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Capilary Electrophoresis (CE) with UV detection, and Titration. Though all three methods have their place in the scientific community, Titration is the most commonly used method in the food industry when determining vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content. However, there is a critical detail within the Titration method many companies miss when testing raw cacao. The method of Titration is unable to differentiate the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) from the vitamin's analogs. The result is what is known as a ""false positive."" This is why, at Navitas Naturals, we use HPLC when testing raw cacao's vitamin C content. The HPLC method looks directly for vitamin C (ascorbic acid), and not just the analogs. Additionally, after sending samples of our products to another lab to test using the CE method, the reports returned consistent the HPLC results. We have now also tested one of the largest raw cacao brands in the United States using the Titration and HPLC methods. And yet again the results confirm our previous conclusion that raw cacao has no vitamin C (ascorbic acid) present. Cacao is a tremendously beneficial superfood, containing a wide spectrum of minerals and phytonutrients. It is important to be clear however, Vitamin C is not amongst these nutrients. Sincerely, Zach Adelman, President Navitas Naturals …",258 out of 270 users found this review helpful
" A perfect ""Anytime"" coffee that is sure to please.",5,"I have tried many, many brands and blends in my Keurig coffee maker and this is definetely one of my favorites. The type of coffe I drink depends on my mood. Sometimes I want a strong, bold cup like, Newman's Own Extra-bold Special Blend K-cups, 80 Pk for Keurig Brewers and sometimes I want something more mild like, Mountain K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108-ct.- Nantucket Blend But ever since I have had my Keurig I have been looking for one of my favorite coffees. The Dunkin Donut brand. This coffee is superb and very much like the Dunkin Donut brand. Not bold or bitter. Not weak or under flavored. It is smooth and very flavorful. It is the perfect crowd pleasing blend for any time of day or night. I have shopped all over and you can't beat the variety or the price here on Superstore when you join their club. A great value. I do wish that Superstore would change the name by removing ""Extra Bold"". It is not. It is, at most, a medium roast. Even when brewed with the smallest setting of the Keurig I would not concider it bold. It comes out great on the medium size setting. Very remanicent of that great cup of Joe you would get in the old days at your favorite diner. …",31 out of 32 users found this review helpful

 Not a K-cup but works in a Keurig,4,"As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on Superstore. Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable! …",45 out of 48 users found this review helpful
 Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor,4,"To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes. NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words ""Medium Extra Bold"" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Superstore should correct that description and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other. …",454 out of 462 users found this review helpful
 Newman's Own Organics Dog Food,5,"I cannot express enough how pleased I am with this dog food. I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding. For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems. Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food. After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me. Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is. I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority. I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair ****. I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go. I highly recommend Newman's Own dog and cat food. I also feed my two dogs Newman's Own biscuits as treats. …",88 out of 89 users found this review helpful

 Perfect for Ice Cream and Popsicles,5,"Barry Farms is known for their quality and rare, hard-to-find ingredients. Guar Gum is no exception, but anything can be found on Superstore, right? Barry Farms to the rescue! The thickening effect of Guar Gum is similar to gelatin, but the end result is more of a syrup than a jello. Guar Gum has a thickening power nearly 8 times greater than that of corn starch. Many ice creams and popsicles, even Italian ices, call for two main ingredients: Guar Gum (which, being the dietary fiber that it is, has been known to help lower cholesterol) and sometimes Xanthan Gum (also available from Barry Farms: [...]). Both of these gums behave quite differently, and Xanthan Gum can be harder to mix into your liquid solution, but both are effective means to preventing crystallization of liquids, which is how you get softer ice cream and popsicles instead of rock hard ice! Guar Gum can also be used in baked goods to increase dough yield and improves texture and shelf life, in pastry fillings to keep the pastry crust crisp and flaky, in dairy to thicken milk, yogurt, kefir, and liquid cheese products and to maintain homogeneity and texture of ice creams and sherbets, in meat as lubricant and binder, to improve the stability and appearance of salad dressings, barbecue sauces, relishes, ketchups and others dressings/sauces, and even in dry soups, and instant oatmeal mixes. …",52 out of 54 users found this review helpful

At roughly $2 (or less on sale), this is far cheaper than going out to eat at an Indian restaurant. My girlfriend and I make this but we first cook down some sweet onion and brown the chicken a bit before adding the curry paste and water. The instructions tell you to add raw chicken but that sounds a little odd to us. We also like to add some extra heat via red chili powder. If you brown the chicken first, cut it into large enough pieces so that they don't dry out during cooking. We've also used this paste to make butter shrimp & it's a great alternative.

 Diamond Pet Foods RECALLED,1,"Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled. But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up. So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now. To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too. But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too. Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food. I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat. Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny. Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky. She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains. She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named ""Taste Of The Wild"" in Bison the most. But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for ""SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"" This company makes various products that have been recalled. Such as: Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.

It's been...gawd only knows how long. A day? A week since I've had my beloved Huy Fong sriracha sauce...? I don't know - time is irrelevant when your Jack is gone. And in my case, there is only one Jack. ""The Rach."" It was Visitor Day. I'd been two months Rach-free (RF) and was looking forward to seeing people again - real people, not the sanitized, medicated zombies in the Ward... the stupified, insipid drones and their robotic dips of french fries into the sugared slick called ""Ketchup."" ""Good enough..."" the nurses would say. ""Remember, the taste is good enough..."" and nod in prescribed approval at our ""progress."" I hated the tastelessness of it all. But what had my yearning gotten me so far? Here I was, a Pathetic Wreck of man, who's hope and potential, wasted by the addictive pull of the bottle with the white rooster... ""Lucille is here to see you, Wily."" Oh gawd. Not her! She was The One - did they not know?! Was this a sick test of my will?!?! ""Hellooo...wiLY!"" She sauntered to table, dismissing the porters with that look - did I see a smirk?!? No! In an unconcious flinch I snatched an individual portion-pack of mayo and began squishing it nervously - she slid onto the plastic seat with a sneering contempt and lifted the hamburger bun. A slab of processed cheese product atop a rapidly cooling foodservice grade grade patty. Of beef. Her eyes flicked at the condiment tray like a snake tongue tasting the fear of its prey - little packets of red, white, yellow and blue...and then...she... oh gawd... she reached into her coat...and... **** her! **** her! The shamelessness of it all! ""Want...this?"" The green nozzle peeked from her bosom and...I swear...it... it... did it laugh? Did it howl? Did it... (lightning flash, thunder - the sound of roaring rain, the gutteral humphs of bloodhounds) Time stretched and distorted - the space between the bottle and my reflexive snatch disappeared as if my arm had become the tongue of a chameleon; my hand the sticky mass, the 28oz bottle of Rach in her coat, the prey...the food...the LIFE... SNAP! Foul, foul temptress...she'd removed the silver seal! But could I care!? No. At the moment, the deed was no betrayal of my Rach Sobriety but an act of glorious courtesy, saving myself the precious milisecond that it would have required to remove it before twisting the nozzle, dispensing the red SOUL onto my hamburger patty in a fantastic, psychedelic *splurrrrrrrtppplp!* Mwwwahhhhaaaaa...I shuddered in ecstasy, the wonderful aroma of rich, sensuous, spicy, sweet, delicious, holy Huy Fong Sriracha sauce filled my nostrils as Life itself fills the lungs of a submerged man breaking the surface of water, sucking in breath.... Two bites and the cheeseburger was devoured...Rach spread across my face in a Joker-like grin, sprayed across my hospital whites, the result of a gruesome orgy of deliciousness... The alarm sounded like a WW2 air raid klaxon - ""Flavor in Ward C! Flavor in Ward C!"" ""QUick! I've left the window open!"" She pointed to..well, one of the windows that was open and with 28oz Huy Fong Sriracha bottle in hand, made my break - landing in a spray of glass (in my haste, I jumped through the wrong window) and ripping of cheap nylon screen. How did I traverse the 100 feet to the fence? How did I scale the concertina wired confines? I have no idea. It's all a blur. So. Why the One Star (I keep giving Sriracha One-Star and people are starting to get a clue why)? 28oz is lame! It's just not enough!! I'm thinking a 3gallon bag...and a Camelback(tm) pack... this...this...28oz for the worlds most fantastically zesty and (it should be obvious by now) ADDICTING condiments?!?!

" Delicious cookies, but not single serving packs",3,"Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies. If you're going to give your child cookies, these are not so bad healthwise. However, the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving, when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each. That's a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child, I think. I buy snack packs so that when I'm on the go, I can open a bag and hand it to my kid.

 Babysitter's Best Buddies,4,"A couple of the kids in the neighborhood like to play 'Cops and Robbers' when their family is over -- where they're the cops, I'm the perp, and it's 'Violating Civil Rights' week on Law & Order, apparently. And I'm tired of being locked in the basement 'holding cell', or beaten with a sock full of army men, or being Miranda'd with 'the right to remain dorky'. Well, this time I decided to take the 'Cops' into my own hands, and make them the robbers for once. What's better about being a cop than eating doughnuts? Try being a cop with two young perps in custody and eating doughnuts in front of them until they cry their little lawbreaking eyes out. Yeah, that's right -- you kids should have thought about doughnuts before we started pretending you were armed robbers or embezzlers or cow rustlers or whatever. But what's even better than that? Deciding to turn the two young 'perps' into snitches, 'bribing' them with three dozen doughnuts for 'turning state's evidence', and then sending them home with their parents on a sugar high that would make a methadone clinic worker weep. Don't worry, Mom and Dad; the kid's will be asleep by ten. AM. Next Tuesday. Have fun with that! …",14 out of 27 users found this review helpful

Not bad and I did not need to have all of that plastic packaging. The bulbs do come on immediately, but as with most, they need about 120s to full hit maximum light output.

 BEWARE:  MADE IN CHINA,1,"I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so ""addictive."" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is ""decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods."" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats. Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes? Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky? I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring. Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.

 Quaker has taken themselves out of the instant oats market,1,"I love oatmeal, and occasionally make steel-cut oatmeal in my ricemaker, but I've been eating more Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal - for years. Pallets of it. Literally, I had bought lots of ""value pack"" 24-packs the last time they went on sale at Shop Rite, and when I finally ran out, a couple months ago, I bought the ""new"" improved package at Stop & Shop. The new flavor is horrible - not just compared to the original, or to McCanns, but truly horrible. I couldn't finish it. Tasted a little like coffee grounds. Even adding brown sugar or a little milk didn't change it at all. How could you screw up a decades old favorite like that? Why not offer it as a new product, and leave your loyal customer's with their proven favorites? (Why didn't Coca-Cola just release ""New Coke"" in the '80s, instead of screwing up their brand loyalty? And why didn't Quaker learn from Coke?) Since then, I've been buying the Stop & Shop brand, and it's not bad. Not as good as the original Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar, but good enough. Quaker has effectively removed themselves from the instant oatmeal market, in my opinion. Hope they correct their mistake, but I don't think that happens very often. I'll be waiting for one of those ""We heard you, and we're making it right"" commercials... Until then, it's store-brand oats for me. …",28 out of 31 users found this review helpful
 Economically nuts,3,"This is just nuts from an economic perspective. This starter costs $12.61 (if you assume free shipping), and this is good for three batches of 2 liters each. That works out to $4.20 per batch. The milk for this costs about $4.00 a half gallon for organic milk. So now you're up to $8.20 per batch. But you also should add some non-fat dry milk, about 1/3 cup per batch, adding about another $2.00 (for organic). So the 2 liters (or 1/2 gallon) of yogurt is now up to $10.20, and this doesn't include the amortized cost of a yogurt maker, if you're using one, or the electricity cost. Or instead, you can buy very high quality Nancy's organic yogurt in a great reusable container for under $7.00 for a half gallon and not have to do any work at all.

 Sharing my research & pediatrician did not recommend this formula,1,"Hello: I felt it was important for me to share this review with fellow parents. I have been trying to make a decision on an organic formula (weighing the pros and cons of Earth's Best and Baby's Only) and I have done weeks of research, I have read the cornucopia reports, combed clinical studies I could find on the internet regarding DHA/ARA, websites of all the major formaula manufacturer's, research on hexane, etc, etc, and I finally talked to my pediatrician. Here is a summary of what I found: Earth's Best: Major Pro: Milk-based. My pediatrician was adamant that the first ingredient in an infant formula should be milk. Despite opinions I've seen out there about the composition of carbs - lactose and other sugars - in breast milk and its similarity to composition in Baby's only, there is no doubt that formula should be milk-based. All forms of syrup - whether it is corn syrup or brown rice syrup are sugars, and not suitable substitutes for lactose. These sugars can not only lead to problems with obesity and diabetes later in life, but the lack of lactose does not sufficiently meet an infant's nutritional needs. Major Con: Hexane-derived DHA. By the way, it's not just the organic formulas that have this controversial method of DHA/ARA extraction. Every formula on the market - organic and non-organic has DHA derived in this way. I called every formula manufacturer to verify this. (Martek's LifeDHA is also white-labeled - so you dont always know that it is Martek. But if there is DHA/ARA added to an infant formula or food, whether it is labeled or not, it is almost always going to be from Martek) Baby's only: Major Pro: No DHA/ARA - It is the ONLY formula on the market I can find without DHA/ARA - if anyone else can find another formula, organic or non-organic, let me know! I have literally scoured the marketplace. The only place to find it is Canada (Nestle Good Start) and it's not easy to purchase and ship to the U.S. Major Con: My pediatrician confirmed that brown rice syrup as a first ingredient in an infant formula is not acceptable. She says while Nature's One may market it as better because it doesn't spike insulin levels, at the end of the day it is still sugar, just a different form of corn syrup. She was very concerned that nutritionally this is not suitable for an infant. The other con of baby's only is that it is indeed a toddler formula. When you compare the mineral values you will see for example that the levels of calcium, phosphorous, iodine and a few others are much higher than in other infant formulas. In fact their vitamin/mineral content is more comparable to other toddler formulas on the market, like Good Start 2. I have researched that the higher mineral content could make an infant's kidney system work harder. Not sure of long-term effects, if any. This was outside of my research. Bottom line: I know that many proponents of Baby's only will say that the company is taking a political stance, in fact it does encourage breastfeeding until 12 months, but it also discourages the introduction of dairy milk at 12 months, which really goes against the APA recommendation to introduce dairy milk at 12 months. I have no doubt that Baby's only is meant for toddlers, in fact they tell you to consult a physician if you're offering it to an infant under 12 months. They don't do this for PC reasons, they are a company that cares about revenues, just like all the other formula companies. They say this because it is indeed a toddler formula meant for babies 12 months + There is no perfect solution out there. But I've decided to continue my hunt for a milk-based formula without DHA/ARA, whether organic or non-organic. In the meantime, I can only do what all other parents do - make the best choice having weighed the pros and cons. I choose Earth's best. Why? Because I've done enough research to feel confident that the likelihood of hexane solvent remaining in formula is highly unlikely. My research, which includes talking to a scientist that uses hexane in his laboratory, indicates that hexane is highly volatile and evaporates almost immediately. In other words, by the time it has extracted the oils, it should have evaporated. While you can never be 100% sure of anything in this world, the independent studies do show that no traces of hexane are in the formula). I know it's hard to believe everything you read, so I am only sharing all of this information because I feel it would be wasted if I kept it all to myself! At the end of the day, I feel the nutritional benefit of a milk-based formula outweighs the very small (perhaps non-existent) chance of hexane traces in formula. I hope this helps! …",207 out of 215 users found this review helpful
 Great food for active cats!,5,"I have three very active ferals that I tamed as kittens. They are indoor/outdoor cats and very active. One of them was throwing up his food a lot and the vet suggested it might be the grain products in the food I was feeding them. I switched to Wilderness ""Duck"" flavor and they loved it - and no more sick kitty! The only thing is it has a very strong smell for a dry cat food. Not too bad, but you might try a small bag to see if you can live with the smell. I also tried the salmon flavor - One thing I noticed about the Blue Buffalo ""Wilderness"" salmon flavor is that it did not have the same pungent smell as the duck flavor ""Wilderness"" food. So I liked that! However, the kitties did not attack the salmon variety with the same gusto that they dug into the duck flavor ""Wilderness"" dry food. All in all, this is a good dry food that is great if your kitty has a sensitive stomach. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 I take it for health reasons but it is quite tasty as well,5,"I had problems with my gums and had a high C-Reactive Protein reading (10+), a sign of inflamation in the body and not good if you have high cholestorol. I saw a news clip on 5 superfoods and how they could beneift your body. Acai was attributed with lowering body inflamation. I saw a Zola Daily Wellness Shot at a smoothie store and bought it. After two months of a daily shot my CRP fell to 1.5, a low normal reading. My dentist could not believe the change in my gums. Unfotunately, Zola stopped making the shot and I tried other brands of acai berry juice. Horrid taste, akin to fermented prune juice. I found out, however, that Jamba teamed up with Zola and created Jamba-labled shots using Zola Juice. I talked with Zola and the company said it had the same ORAC (3,000) of the Zola Shot and the same 26,000mg of antioxidents. It is not quite as tasty as the Zola shot but it is pretty tasty itself.

 You'll love Mrs. May's Trio bars.  Gluten & dairy free.,5,"Mrs. May's Trio bars are my favorite snack/energy bars. I love them. They come in four flavors. Cranberry is not my favorite of those flavors, but I still really like it, just not as much as blueberry and strawberry. Though cranberries are pretty tart, the cranberry bar is not noticeably tarter than the others. It does seem less sweet to me than the blueberry and strawberry ones, but the carbs and sugars are the same so it may be my imagination. The name comes from the ingredients. The bars have a trio of trios: 3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits. The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors. The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios. The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower. The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don't really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the ""glue"" that holds all the other ingredients together. The third fruit in the cranberry flavor is dried cranberry. The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt. These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy. The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher. They also have no preservatives. If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts. Because of the nuts, they have 12 grams of fat per bar, but I've been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is ""good"" fat. The label says there is 1.5 grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated. To round out the rest of the nutrition facts: calories, 170; total carbs, 14g; dietary fiber, 2g; sugars, 6g; protein, 5g; cholesterol, 0g; trans fat, 0g; and sodium, 45mg. I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have. They are low sodium but high in taste and they are really satisfying. I used to get granola bars but these are so much better. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 bad beef,2,I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them.

 I loved it,5,"I popped some last night and I love this popcorn. If you like large poofy kernels then this is not for you, but I like small kernel popcorns too, and this one was light and a little crunchy and had good flavor. I think the selling point of this type is that the hulls shatter when it pops (""hullless""), so that you don't get the big painful pieces of hard popcorn hull in your teeth like with larger varieties. I think the popcorn kernels have to be small to be hullless. If you have an air popper and find that small kernel popcorns fly out of it, you could try a different cooking method - I just pop mine in a saucepan on the stove (with a little bit of vegetable oil, and a lid to keep it from flying out), there are also air poppers that don't let the popcorn fly out, or I've seen a microwave bowl that's like air popping but with the microwave as a heat source (but no added oil or anything, like air popping), or some people even just use a paper bag in the microwave (I think with this method they use a little oil too). There are many ways to cook popcorn, and instructions are pretty easy to find on the internet if you need them. …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful
