" Finally, a GREAT substitute for noodles and pasta! And here's the calorie info...",5,"I agree with the reviewer who gave these a stellar rating. We've tried a variety of pasta and noodle alternatives (spaghetti squash etc) and the results ranged from interesting to...terrible. The spaghetti squash was the best alternative but it certainly didn't taste like regular pasta. But regular pasta plays havoc with our blood sugar and whole wheat pasta wasn't to our liking...so we continued our search. These Tofu Shirataki Fettucini are the absolute alternative to pasta which we've found and they are very tasty. I noticed that one person here said they were ""tough"" and ""inedible"". NOT TRUE. Also, they have only 40 calories per package and one package was certainly enough to be a generous serving for me (it might take two packages for someone with a hefty appetite). I tested my blood sugar before and after eating these, both within an hour of eating them and several hours later. My blood sugar stayed nice and level, so there was that benefit as well. As far as texture goes, they ARE closer to an ""al dente"" (a bit chewy) pasta than an overcooked, mushy pasta but we'd always preferred our pasta a bit on the ""al dente"" side. If you don't like ""chewy"" you might not like the Tofu Pasta. That didn't bother us one bit. True, the taste is not identical to pasta but we both felt that (like most tofu) it picked up the taste of whatever we put on it and any remaining taste was subtle, in our opinion. The first time we ate it we put on homemade tomato sauce, fresh Parmesan and oregano and basil (fresh basil) It was yummy! The second time we made spaghetti (canned sauce and ground beef and freshly chopped spices) and it was also delicious. I then experimented with various sauces, from those with a sour cream base to creamed cottage cheese and a bit of butter and green onions. Every time, the result was delicious - and what a calorie savings over regular pasta. We have not eaten them plain or buttered, like regular noodles or pasta. I have a feeling the texture might be more noticable then and there might be a subtle taste that would be different from pasta. This is as detailed and clear as I can be. We were absolutely DELIGHTED to discover and use these and found them to be the best substitute by far for our favorite pasta (although we're certainly open to suggestions for others). PS: Since writing my original review, I wanted to note that I adapted a sweet noodle kugel recipe using these as the ""noodles"". It was delicious. For anyone who might be interested in doing the same, I did NOT bake the kugel like you do a traditional one. I simply used Light Sour cream, cinnamon and Splenda to make a kugel that would work for diabetics or those on a diet. I did heat the noodles in the microwave after draining them because they do tend to leak liquid even when they are heated up without any. I added the other ingredients to the hot noodles and heated gently on the stovetop. Leftovers were eaten cold. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 smashing old-fashioned kippers,5,"Just wanted to embellish my earlier endorsement of this product and the seller -- As I write this, smacking my lips over a scrumptious Sunday brunch [Sept. 4, 2011] of these kippers, I wanted, again, to endorse the product. These are old-fashioned British [sorry you Scottish nationalists] kippers which at least in these parts one cannot find.

 Quickly cleared my slow-running drain,4,"I had a terrible plugged drain that nothing would clear. Finally a friend recommended that vinegar might dissolve the blockage. This had so frustrated me that I decided to buy the best vinegar available. When my box of Modena Extravecchio Gold Seal arrived in the mail I immediately went to work. Within minutes, my kitchen sink was flowing freely once again. I am a bit upset about the short listed shelf life of only two years. I'm afraid that my drain will stop up again just after the two year shelf life has expired and I will be forced to purchase a new case. Given that it is already 75 years old it seems like an unreasonable limitation, but of course I wouldn't risk going against the manufacturer's recommendation. It certainly commands a small premium compared to other drain-cleaner products, but it is well worth the extra money! …",5 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 One of the top two brands of Decaf K-Cups,5,"If you like your coffee a little stronger than mid-strength, this one is for you! You would never know this is decaf coffee. I'm a very fussy coffee drinker - too weak = bla; too strong = bitter and undrinkable. Tully's coffee as a rule is a little stronger then the GM brand, overall. Typically 'House' blends don't mean a whole lot to me, but this one is exceptional. Not bitter, not watery, wonderful aroma. The only other decaf brand I would ever recommend is Emeril's. All the other brands are too weak for me. My husband can only drink decaf and we tried every, single brand when we were switching from ground coffee to the K-cup. This is the only one he liked - and he doesn't like strong coffee and I don't like weak coffee - WE BOTH LOVE THIS ONE!

" Forget Beer Face, I have a case of Tea Face",1,"Nothing beats a creamy, sugary cup of steaming hot tea on a cold and rainy day (I live in Washington, so I drink a lot of tea). I usually buy loose tea at the grocery store, the price isn't great at $24.99lb but the taste is so far above the drab Lipton tea bags I grew up with that now I can't bear to drink tea from teabags. It's like watching television on a tiny black and white after a few weeks of using a a nice flatscreen, horrible and strange. The price for this Davidson's Irish Breakfast was so much lower than what I get at the grocery store that I thought, 'ha! It must be my lucky day!' Well, when something seems too good to be true, it usually is. From the moment I opened the bag, the tea smelled wrong. I still had a few teaspoons of Irish Breakfast from my last visit to the grocery store and when I compared the teas they looked noticeably different. The grocery tea, hereafter known as 'Good Tea' was darker, the tea leaves more solid with occasional bits of bronzyness scattered **** nilly throughout. The 'Good Tea' was not just slightly darker, it was several shades darker. Also, the Davidson's Irish Breakfast had a grayish-green tinge to it. In fact, it looked a lot like the oolong tea I bought last year and have yet to finish (guess I'm not an oolong girl). I made a cup for my hubby, adding just the right amount of cream and sugar. When he's busy working, sometimes I think he'd drink a cup of soy sauce, as long as it was hot and he didn't have to fetch it himself, he's just so distracted, but he took one sip of the Davidson's and made a sour face. Anyways, he wouldn't drink it and I had to toss my cup down the drain too. There's no amount of sugar, cream or lemon slices that can fix this hellish brew. Sorry, but I'd give this a pass. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful

I haven't had a problem with crumbs and powder in the packets I've tried, no more than any other dried fruit I'd buy from Trader Joes or the Gerber ones. It's definitely a small bag for the price, so if you're near a Trader Joes, you should really buy their dried fruits. Superstore does have a great price for this item though...

 Great Green Tea and Great Company!,5,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family. I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine. After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals. Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide. I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others. Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me. I think it tastes great for a decaff tea. It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste. I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 aptly named product,5,"Have been using Natural Calm for 6 years. Highly absorbable form of magnesium helps with nutritional balance and is a quick-acting, gentle muscle relaxer/tension tamer.

If you have a lot of calcium in your system and not enough magnesium, those muscles can't completely relax!

" The Right Food to Wear, and a Tasty Way to Wear It",4,"The stress of a tough year is starting to get to me. I've been puckered up so tight for so long, I'm afraid my puckerer may have frozen that way. So I've been searching for inner peace -- and outer unpuckering -- in personal relaxation products. But expensive gadgets and doodads would just angry my blood up further, so I'm seeking Samadhi on a shoestring budget. When my wife goes to a spa to relax, she always gets some kind of oatmeal facial scrub treatment. I don't know much about pampering, but I'm intimately familiar with a wide variety of hot breakfast cereals. If oatmeal on the face is relaxing, then I'd sure give it a try. I heated several packets of the oatmeal in the microwave, per the cooking instructions, added a little milk and layered it onto my face. I'm not sure what's supposed to happen next in a 'professional' treatment, but in my bathroom, a lot of it just glooped off into the sink. The rest felt... well, like oatmeal on my face. Sticky. Warm. Lumpy, in a way that was less 'relaxing' and more 'get it off my face-y'. The oatmeal did smell nice, and made me sort of hungry, but I don't think I relieved any stress by putting it on my face instead of IN my face. Maybe next time I'll try wearing it with eggs over easy, or a rasher of bacon. Bacon makes *everything* peaceful. …",4 out of 17 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Amazing For Finicky Eaters and Stomach Issues,5,"If you have a dog that turns his or her nose up to all dry and wet foods from premium names such as Wellness CORE, Merrick, Blue Buffalo, Evo, Stella and Chewy's Freeze Dried Patties, Dr. Harvey's etc. then you have to give this a try. My dog is a 40lb Sheltie/Collie mix so having a large highly active dog that wouldn't eat was very stressful I hear many people with toy breeds having the problem but I never thought I would happen with a high energy dog. I was shocked that she hated all other dog food and would only eat a little if I wet the dry food and hand fed her she would really try and starve herself any other way and she was not holding out for human food because I do not give her any knowing the problem would of got worse, if that was possible. I found this food by searching online for food for picky eaters and this came up. I was not hopeful because a lot of the brands I previously tried had similar reviews of picky eaters liking it and my my dog not. When I read that it was jerky like pieces it sparked an interest because she loves those types of treats. The company sent me a Venison trial bag and I purchased the Lamb 2.2lb bag and she lovesssss it. She wakes me up now at 8am whimpering by the bag because she wants it soooo much. The smell and texture is incredible I never saw her eat so fast and she is so much more energetic and happy this food is amazing and not that expensive considering the smaller portion.

 You Sojos People Have Ruined My Cat!,5,"Thanks a lot! I am now the owner of a demanding stoner cat who will accept no other catnip. I've only had this nip for a week, and she already knows what the can looks like. The minute I go anywhere near the can, she starts screaming at me like a banshee for her nip. I tried giving her her old nip (which shall remain nameless) and she turned up her little black nose at it. So, yeah, she knows the difference. All I have to say is this: Bob is about 5 years old, so I figure she's probably got at least another good ten years in her.

 Not Organic -- False Advertising by Bangalla Organic,1,"The product description says: ""Plantation 12X 15 Oz Blackstrap Molasses Unsl Organic Blackstrap Molasses."" The problem is the item is not organic. Now I'm stuck with a whole case. I contacted Bangalla Organic and they insisted the case was organic despite not saying so on the label. They claimed they called the manufacturer to verify. The reality is that the Plantation molasses that is certified specifically says ""certified by the Quality Assurance Internation(QAI.)"" There is no certification on these bottles. It find it hilarious that the product description also says ""(Note: This Product Description Is Informational Only. Always Check The Actual Product Label In Your Possession For The Most Accurate Ingredient Information."" Well, that's not possible to do beforehand if you're buying online. That's why the product description and the word of the seller is so crucial. I will never buy from this company again.

 THE best muesli ever. No kidding.,5,"I'm extremely pleased to see Superstore offering this cereal. Alpen (No Sugar Added version) is the best muesli available in Britain. Believe me, I've tried most of them (British expat). And your American mueslis don't come anywhere close to the deliciousness of this. Swiss-style muesli in general is much easier to eat than traditional muesli - mainly due to the fact that it softens in milk much faster and it includes whey powder which makes it a little sweeter and creamier when you add milk. I've tried a few other brands of Swiss-style muesli and this one beats the lot. It has just the right amount of raisins and nuts in it. :-) A perfect breakfast, can't wait to eat it again! …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful

You can imagine my shock and dismay when the UPS man showed up, with a twelve pack. One box of twelve cans. I tried to return it, I could have bought four of these for what I paid here. I've never been so disappointed with Superstore. I love Superstore, I truly do, but the fact that they charged me an astronomical rate for this is most unfair, and the no-returns policy is bunk.

 An efficient appliance that doesn't take up too much counter space,4,"Through recommendations from friends and an informal cost-benefit analysis (j/k) I bought this item. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the price. Nice concept in a convenient package that is aesthetically pleasing and holds the Williams-Sonoma name...but I still think the price is jacked-up. I am a first time mom, and I was excited to start whipping up some organic fruits and veggies for my daughter. I resisted buying the Babycook at first thinking a stove-top steamer and my Magic Bullet would suffice. I am embarrassed to say how long it took me, so let's just say after making a batch of carrots, peas, and corn, the excitement was over. It was so tedious! And so many dishes to wash. The next day I bought the Babycook and made twice the amount of food in half the time, with very little cleanup. I'm ok with the amount of food it produces since I don't like to make big batches due to freezer space. The blade is very strong and does a very good job on hard items like the skins of beans and peas. My Bullet would still leave little chunks that were potential choking hazards. I make a week's worth of baby food, and when the machine is not in use I let the water chamber and other parts air dry. I don't think it is very useful for reheating because it takes a long time and sometimes the food comes out too moist (but this might be user error). So far the product has been a pleasure to use and has made my life a whole lot easier. …",20 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 be aware: they downgraded when they changed packaging :(,2,"Sadly, this is no longer the super-premium jerky that it used to be. Granted, if you're used to grocery-store jerky, then this is still a much better product. But if you've acclimated to chemical-free jerky, then the ""smoke flavoring"" that they've recently started adding tastes like, well, smoke flavoring, and not the real thing. You may not notice a difference. Apparently jerky is one of those things where you notice a down-shift in flavor, even when you wouldn't notice an up-shift in flavor. (Like margarine eaters think butter tastes fine, and powdered milk drinkers think cartoned milk tastes fine, but when people do the opposite, they find the tastes terrible. Jerky is the same--if you upgrade from convenience store jerky to premium you might not notice it, but when you downgrade from ""the real thing"" to anything else, it tastes distinctly artificial.) I used to buy this in bulk every few months (with a discount per Superstore Subscribe & Save), but the change in flavor made me double-check the ingredients list, and I found that the new ""smoke flavoring"" was added when they changed packaging. So this jerky is good, but not worth the premium any more. If anyone has a suggestion for an all-natural replacement without ingredients like ""smoke flavoring"" I'd appreciate it, since I'm now searching for something new. …",17 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Malty Breakfast.,4,"Given that it was a Scotsman -- a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale -- who first marketed his particular blend under the name ""breakfast tea"" (and given that Drysdale's creation would soon come to be (mis)appropriated by tea houses south of the border, who proceeded to add the word ""English"" to its name), it seems only fitting that the Scots should have their own version of breakfast tea, too, after all. Even stronger than the already potent English Breakfast blend, this particular one is made to match not only the traditionally heavy English but even the Scottish breakfast, which like the English variety includes pork, sausages and eggs, but is amplified by that so distinctly Caledonian culinary creation: haggis (to most of the rest of the world, a classic case of ""acquired taste"" at best). A blend of primarily Indian teas, Scottish Breakfast contains a particularly high percentage of Assam, which with its malty flavor ideally complements the soft Scottish mountain waters ... as well as Scotland's famous single malt whiskies, the ""water of life"" (""uisgue beatha"") likewise coming from the areas where those same mountain waters are flowing. Due to its strength, Scottish Breakfast tea maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. As an everyday ""work horse"" and early morning pick-me-up it is easily as good as (if not better than) its more famous sibling from south of the border, or any kind of coffee.

I gave a bag to my boss since i wanted him to try the goji, which he had previously liked, but had to take it back from him for the reason.

It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut. I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).

" Versatile, Easy to Use, Tasty!",5,"I've never used TVP before this, so I wasn't sure quite what to expect when I purchased this product. So far I've used one whole bag and I couldn't be happier with it. My whole family enjoys eating the food I've made with TVP instead of ground beef, and so far I haven't noticed any stomach issues in anyone, even the baby. (And though I was a little unnerved by another reviewer's comment on the smell, I didn't really notice anything more than a subtle grain scent when I put my nose in the bag.) The first thing I did with my TVP was to take the liquid left from making a pot roast in my crockpot, skim away most of the fat, and use the liquid to rehydrate the TVP. It made a really delicious meatloaf-tasting crumble that we ate in sandwiches with ketchup. A few days later, I made a homemade spaghetti sauce with TVP simmered right in, and that turned out great too. I did notice that the TVP made the recipe just a little sweeter than it would've been, but I compensated with extra spices. I would leave the sugar out of the sauce recipe next time I make it with TVP. And last night, I rehydrated the last cup of TVP in the bag with water I'd mixed a packet of taco seasoning into. It made a very serviceable taco meat substitute for beefy taco macaroni and cheese. Just from my one bag, one quarter of my order, I got three meals for my family, which works out to less than seventy-five cents of TVP per meal. I don't know that I'll ever try to actually make a hamburger with this, but I just love it for any recipe calling for ground beef. Instead of defrosting and cooking a pound of beef, rehydrating a cup of TVP is fast and simple. I will definitely buy this again. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 As much as I LOVE this soup mix....it'll kill you!!!,1,"I truly love the flavor of this soup mix but it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil. That means it has 'trans fats' that effectively cause hardening of the arteries and heart disease. That's not even mentioning that it has soybean products in it.

And it has Autolyzed Yeast Extract which is another name for the infamous neurotoxin....MSG (monosodium glutamate). I don't understand why this well known company has to use dangerous ingredients when there are so many substitutes that will not destroy our populations health. Is it purely because it's so much cheaper to use these dangerous, life threatening products that they only see their profit margins and not the health of the nation.

" Very Dry, but They Still Taste OK",3,"I was so excited to get a good deal on raw gogi berries. They are usually $15 a lb or more. I have tried them several times before and they were always quite chewy, like raisins, but less plump. The goji berries I have eaten in the past were also raw with no additives(unlike the mass marketed kind with sugar and oil added), so I expected these to be the same. These actually crack and turn to powder when you crush them with your fingers. I tried soaking them, but they just taste like waterlogged, goji-flavored bark. I wanted to return them, but the return info says food items must be returned unopened. I am pretty disappointed in the texture of these goji berries. The expiration date indicates they are fresh (one full year before expiration). I guess I will just grind them up to make powder to add to smoothies and raw chocolate recipes. In the future, however, I will pay the extra money for the chewy goji berries, which taste great on their own and in recipes. The ones I bought here have OK flavor, but they are just so dry. A friend suggested i soak them and try dehydrating them again. I don't know if i want to bother with that, or if it will even work. the good news is that because they are so dry, the 10 lb bag is pretty big. I imagine that it would take fewer goji berries to make 10 lbs if they were more chewy. Also, this product is much more expensive elsewhere, even when purchased wholesale with a huge minimum order, so if you don't mind dry berries, this is an inexpensive way to get all the benefits of goji berries. Plus, i didn't have to pay shipping with Superstore Prime. That's a huge savings.

 Transcendental - you gotta try it.,5,"I'm a bit of spice hound and have flirted with other hot sauces before, but nothing has ever seized hold of me like Sriracha. An old Greenwich Village burger joint near where I worked at NYU used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer. The memory haunted me for years before I finally picked up a bottle. I shouldn't have waited. This stuff is amazingly addictive with a garlicky sweet hot yumminess that's hard to describe. It sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and I've drained a bottle in a 3 month period. Incredible on eggs, superb on burritos, utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegitable dishes from the Chinese restaurant. I put a squirt in the health low-sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up. Utterly highest recommendation. I, personally, do not buy the 28oz size - even though it's almost the same price as the 17oz size. (it's not a total freebie - Shipping is a bit higher on the 28oz). While Sriracha has preservatives and doesn't need refrigeration it does oxidize a bit and at the pace I use it the bottom third of the 28oz gets a bit stale for me, while I suck the 17oz down while it's still fresh. If I lived in a house with more spice hounds (I'm the only one around here) or if I were cooking with it more often in larger recipies the 28oz would be a big bargain. …",55 out of 56 users found this review helpful

 Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on,5,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups. I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive. I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products. If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :) EcoBrew VS Solofill First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew. Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker. These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable! I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product. The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly. …",559 out of 562 users found this review helpful

 Delicious!,5,"Organic Valley Organic Nonfat Dry Milk Powder definitely sets the standard for other dry milks! It does not have that ""processed, cardboard"" taste that supermarket milks have and the fact that it is organic only adds to the wholesome nature of this item. I mainly use dry milk for baking and when I make yogurt, so a fresh taste is essential to the finished product. If you're considering purchasing dry milk, I would highly recommend that you try Organic Valley. …",33 out of 34 users found this review helpful

 Wonderful on it's own or mixed in drinks,5,"This is the finest Cola I have found yet. There is a small store near me who sells it by the bottle. For cola drinkers, this is significantly better than Coke, Pepsi, etc., but the real treat is when you use this in place of Coke in drinks. (for those of you of legal drinking age) It's not just the quality of the liquor that makes a good rum & cola, Captain & cola, bourbon & cola, etc., it's the quality of the COLA that makes a good drink SOOO much better. Fore those of you mixing, use a high quality liquot with this high quality cola.

If you look at the ingredients, the product contains Hydrolyzed Soy Protein. Anything 'hydrolyzed' or 'autolyzed' creates the harmful portion of MSG--glutamates.

 Review on TASTE,5,"I'm writing this review, because it's exactly the kind of review I was looking for before I bought this product, but could not find anywhere. When I first started using Natural Calm I bought it in the Raspberry-Lemon flavor, thinking it sounded the best and used it with water (usually just put it inside a water bottle and shook it up to mix it and drank it that way). Both me and my husband used it and HE really liked the taste, but for me this stuff tasted BAD. I don't know why, but I did not like the taste at all. I guess some people do (obviously my husband did or at least didn't mind it) but I definitely did not. It made drinking it everyday a CHORE. So, this next time I decided to try the one that isn't flavored and I like it SO MUCH better, like a million times better. I just mix it in with my blueberry-pomegranate juice and it's great! It is virtually tasteless and just adds a little 'fizz' to the juice that I actually LIKE. I also put it in teas as well. I wanted to write this review just to let people know that not everyone loves the raspberry-leomon flavor (and I didn't think I'd like the orange to begin with, but haven't tried it yet and probably never will). There are a lot of reviews claiming it tastes great... but for me not so much. I recommend the flavor-less one. Also, be careful when starting out to use the recommendation on the bottle and start with 1/2 a teaspoon a day and then work up from there. :-) I never had any negative side effects, but I guess some people get diarrhia if they take too much in the beginning. This stuff really is amazing and will help you feel GREAT! :-) If you're thinking about trying it don't hesitate. It has many, many benefits. You might just be using it to help with mood or to help with ADHD/concentration, or just for a natural way to keep from becoming constipated... There are MANY benefits. But no matter what you're using it for, it's bound to help out your body and mood in other ways as well! :-) Can't say enough good things about this product! Just try to get the flavor-less one first, it's so much better!! I hated having to drink it when we had the raspberry-lemon one. But now I definitely don't, and like the little fizz it gives my blueberry-pomegranate juice & teas! :-) Drinking it right now and loving it! And loving the way it makes me feel and the concentration it gives me! …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 McCann Steel Cut Oats,4,"SHIPPING As was stated by many others, the shipping for this product is too hard on the cans. Of my four cans, one was nearly undamaged. One had cosmetic damage in the form of a dented side. The other two were dented to the extent of having sharp creases in the bottom and flaws near the seal lines at the top. I never buy cans like those at the supermarket. COOKING The cooking went much better than I expected. The evening before, I put 1/4 cup chopped black walnuts, 10 pitted prunes cut into pieces with scissors, and two cups of water into my saucepan. I brought this mixture to a boil over a simmering-level flame on my propane stove. I dumped in one-half-cup of McCann's steel cut oats and stirred. I waited for the mixture to come to a boil again, stirred it a little, turned off the flame, put a lid on the saucepan, and went to bed. In the morning I was surprised to find that it was perfectly edible with no further cooking. I did heat it up again on the stove before serving but it stuck to the pot, so I think in the future I will microwave it right in the bowls just before serving it. EATING These oats were good, but it was hard to say if they were ""nuttier"" in flavor than the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats which I had been eating because I cooked them both with nuts. The texture was of course firmer. I do like bulgar wheat and these oats are more like that in texture. Since I was careful not to overcook the rolled oats, there was not much difference in the ""slime"" feel of the two, but the rolled oats were papery much like eating raw oatmeal cookie dough. NUTRITION I found little difference between the nutritional content listed on the McCann steel cut can and that listed on the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats container. I had to do some Internet research to find the differences which turn out to be subtle but important for certain types of health conditions. There is also the likelihood of the product simply being fresher due to less processing and better packaging at the mill. REPEAT PURCHASE Now that I have found that the cooking of steel cut oats is much less intimidating than I had imagined, I will probably eat these in preferance to rolled oats in the future. The possibility of adding them to soups and other cooked entrees in place of barley or bulgar wheat is a bonus. However, I will probably try a more economical source as I am not convinced that Ireland's soil is superior to that in any other region in which oats are farmed, and metal cans with sharp creases and bent seams don't seem worth the extra cost. …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 DID I FORGET TO MENTION? -- IT TASTES GOOD TOO!!!,5,"""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" is one of the healthiest and tastiest foods you have available at your local grocery. When you read the label, you see a lot of nutrition and few calories for just 2 tablespoons. But much of what wheat germ has is not on the label. For instance, it promotes gentle regularity and is an excellent source of chromium, selenium, and other trace minerals. It is also a balanced package of protein, carbohydrates and fat, without saturated fat. It promotes heart health and provides an energetic feeling. Mixed with vitamin C, some people use it as a very effective antihistamine without side effects. Since 1982, I have incorporated ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" into my daily diet. The easiest ways to achieve this are as follows: 1] Adding to cold cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, homemade bread, puddings, macaroni and cheese, applesauce and literally anything you want that has sufficient moisture. 2] Substituting wheat germ for bread crumbs in meatloaf, veal/ chicken cutlets, or any fried batter. Kretschmer's Wheat Germ comes toasted in a vacuum-sealed bottle which makes it a very stable and fresh product. It even has an expiration date printed across the top of the bottle in plain sight. Raw wheat germ from the health food store tastes awful, turns rancid sometimes before you buy it, and is usually poorly packaged. This ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" gets a 5 for nutrition, ease of use, packaging, and value which makes Kretschmer's Wheat Germ hard to beat. Oh, I forget to mention --IT TASTES GOOD TOO! DOWNSIDE: This 12 ounce package costs only $1.00 less than the 20-ounce package and should be passed by when the 20-ounce size is available. Sometimes the 20-ounce size is out of stock or absent from store shelves so check first. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Not the best quality,3,"My family drinks a lot of coconut milk (about a can a day) and we have tried almost every brand out there. This one tastes OK, but contains more preservatives than any other we have tried. Unfortunately the ingredients are not listed here so I wasn't able to find that out until after my case arrived. For the price this Roland brand isn't a bad deal but I would recommend Chaokoh or Value Coconut Milk, 14-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12) over this one. Natural Value has no fillers or preservatives and tastes great which means it is perfect for making healthy coconut yogurt with the YM9 1-Quart Yogurt Maker . If you haven't tried making coconut yogurt yet I highly recommend it! A lot of people are still under the impression that Coconut milk is bad for you. There was some faulty research done years ago on hydrogenated coconut oil which is mostly to blame for this. If you are one of those people that still think coconut is bad I recommend reading Good Fat Cookbook to help set the record straight. …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful

My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer. It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut. I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).

 OUTSTANDING quality and value!,5,"I am thoroughly pleased with Blue Buffalo dog food (specifically, the chicken & brown rice recipe for large breed, and large breed senior dogs). I have a 72 pound Black Labrador Retriever (very small for this breed, but still ""large"") - He is 8 years old, and EVERYONE thinks he's under 4 years of age.. . .. He runs around like a puppy. . .. Full of puppy-like energy and has has the nicest sheen on his coat; he actually looks purple when the sun shines on his fur. All of these great things have happened since switching him from other ""premium"" dog food brands. At roughly $50.00 a bag, one might be tempted to go with a less expensive brand, but here's my particular take on this - My dog, again at 72 pounds, only goes through 5 bags a year (that's only $250.00 a YEAR!) . . . . Here's why: The conversion rate of this this food is amazing! With cheaper foods (which contain fillers and binders), a lot of stool is produced. On Blue Buffalo, I've noticed that my dog's stools are MUCH smaller (better conversion in the digestive tract), and his portions are super small, since his body is actually USING more of the food, not just passing it through. The stool isn't mushy and large. (A lot can be judged about overall health with monitoring your canine's poop) Bottom line: At $50.00 a bag, I'm saving A LOT over the course of my best friend's life, while giving him what I feel is the best food out there. Portions are so small, that I actually feel guilty when I give him so little at meal time (that's from being conditioned to seeing larger portions when feeding a lesser quality food). His body and mind are years younger than what the calendar shows. Money saved, since I'm not buying a ""cheap"" $25.00 bag of dog food every month. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Doesn't Taste Like Instant,5,"I discovered this coffee 6 years ago while on a trip to Maryland where our hostess served it at breakfast. I thought it was brewed and was surprised to see the jar in her hand as she made more. I had stopped brewing coffee at home because a) finding good brew coffee is hit or miss, b) finding a good coffee maker is expensive and hit or miss, c) it's a waste of coffee when brewing for one, and d) it involves too much cleanup. Taster's Choice was just what I needed: a great tasting coffee that I could make just enough of for one and not have to clean up much of anything. A perfect storm of great taste and convenience. I began with the original roast (loved it but eventually needed a stronger aroma) and graduated to the Gourmet (dark) roast that they are now calling French roast. It tastes like and has the aroma of great brewed coffee. There's nothing else like it on the grocery shelves. I've tried the others and they're not even in the same class as this ""instant"" coffee. To call it instant is misleading. ""Instant"" is a pejorative in coffee world and Taster's Choice deserves better. This roast is strong, robust, and can be bitter if you use too much. If you like your coffee mild, try the Taster's Choice original blend. If you prefer robust flavor and aroma, try this blend. It's great.
