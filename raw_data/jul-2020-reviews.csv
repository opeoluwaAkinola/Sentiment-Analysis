 Great healthy moisturizer,5,"I ordered this after having a facial where they used a mixture of almond oil, coconut oil and tamanu oil. My skin felt so wonderful, I had to try it for myself! She recommended just getting coconut oil. I actually really like that it solidifies so that I can just rub a little in my palms to heat it and apply it to my face & body. It does feel a bit greasy at first, but absorbs nicely and my skin has never felt or looked better. (I'm also using diluted apple cider vinegar as an astringent.) Now I need to try some of the other uses for coconut oil! …",31 out of 32 users found this review helpful
 Love the Hemp!,4,"I really enjoy the hemp hearts. I have come to crave them. I am always looking for a good deal and this is indeed a great price for the qty. These come to abt 3 to 5 dollars less per lb. than what I can get locally. If I use auto ship it is 5 to 7 dollars less. My only complaint is the hulls of the 3 brands I have tried this has by far the most hulls and the only one with intact seeds. I doesn't take much to de-hull them but, it is time consuming. I realize ""hulls are a good source of fiber"" but, my teeth do not agree. I am tempted to pay a little more for less.

 PET FOOD RECALL WORRIES?  NO PROBLEM WITH NEWMAN'S!,5,"Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets. Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural. In doing this research, I found out that not only does Newman's company make salad dressing, as we all know, but ALSO a VAST variety of human and pet treats as well! :) I got a great deal through Superstore on this pack of six bags, so I got two flavors and sizes for my dogs. They are ALL natural, and when you touch them yourself and feel the texture, and see the actual oats and cheese or whatnot for yourself, you will be so happy you are feeding them to your pet instead of **** food. People have no idea just how awful most name brand pet food is and that it is really like the equivalent of feeding junk food to their kids for every meal. But it's not our faults when pet food companies are abusing our trust. Get these treats.

 Best tasting one right now,4,"Fast forward to January 2012, this is the best tasting one out there. I am a coconut water fan and have tried them all. ONE used to be the best before they move their production to another country. There is something about coconuts from Brazil. They are not as sweet and offer a more nutty flavor if that's what you are looking for. This brand has a very subtle taste so if you coming from the sweeter brands, you will not like it. With all the other brands moving their production to other countries and no longer using coconuts from Brazil, this is my favorite. Below is a review from about about year and half ago. I have tried about 5 brands of coconut water, Amy and Bryans, ONE, Nature Factor, Zico, and VitaCoco. This one has the most subtle taste of all of them and looking at the nutritional listing on the box, seems to contain the least amount of sugar. For some, it might taste like water since the flavor does not seem to come out compared to the other brands. Amy and Bryans and Nature Factor coconuts are way too sweet for my taste and I think they get their coconut water from Thailand. Vita Coco tastes a bit tart. Zico used to be my favorite before they switch from all natural to concentrate and though I have not tried it, based on other people's reviews, it does not come close to any of these particular ones. So in the end, ONE coconut will be the brand I will continue to buy and if Zico comes back into the market, I might pick them second. For my taste, the ONE brand tastes the best. …",21 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 Don't know what the raving is about,3,"I was expecting more (much more actually) after reading the reviews. And for the record, I really like coconut. But maybe it's that I really like REAL coconut. As for this coffee? It's okay, that's about the best I can say for it. Flavor is rather synthetic and seems to vary from pod to pod. Smell is nice. It isn't the worst flavored coffee I've ever had, but it ain't a ""contenda"" for a regular spot on my shelf. I love (and drink) many flavored coffees but I can't see going out of my way for this one again...maybe if I find it on clearance or something.

 Read the warning on the bottle.,5,"Before ordering this product I compared the reviews between this product and the dozens of similar products containing the Ghost Pepper. Since Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia hot sauce seemed to have the best reviews it is the one I picked. At only five ounces it is not exactly a bargain. Keeping in mind the fact that I could not find any sauces containing the Ghost pepper locally I was not concerned with the price. So I took a leap of faith in Dave's sauce. I was not disappointed. I received my bottle in only two days using Superstore Prime. It came in bubble wrap and was completely safe in it's packaging. After popping off the seal I took a big whiff and passed it around the room. The aroma was fantastic and a kick in the face at the same time. Our mouths watered immediately. Ignoring the warnings of my family, I had to try a dab on my finger right away. The taste was great but soon came a wave of intense heat which overpowered the taste. My eyes watered and I smiled in satisfaction as I reached for a cold beverage. My money did not go to waste. At dinner time I decided it would go great on my chicken. I only wanted to pour a little on. I shook the bottle anticipating the thickness would not allow the sauce to come easily out of the bottle. I was wrong. A big glob covered my meal. My wife argued with me not to eat all of it and get some off the chicken. But like most husbands, I did not listen to my wife. I did not want to waste it. So i took the first bite...excellent taste...but then....oh god...for some reason the spiciness made me crazily devour the whole thing. What a dumb thing to do. The next half hour was torture. My eyes were running and red, I got the hiccups and felt as though I wanted to throw up but did not. I drank all of my soda fast. I slammed my hands on the table in agony as my wife prepared the milk which could not come fast enough. I was in bad shape. I would not wish it on the worst of my enemies. Dave...You got me. On closer inspection of the bottle, after my episode, I discovered the warning. Use a drop at a time. Bah! Stupid me. Well...you know what they say. Good stories usually start out with a bad decision. This product should come with a dropper. It is definitely a favorite in my book. I will buy it again but with more respect for the sauce. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 bad beef,2,I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you. …,13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 I LOVE Erythritol,5,"Erythritol is not nearly as popular as it should be, which is a shame. It tastes just like sugar with some differences. -It sometimes has a cooling effect, like winter-green candies, but it can be countered with mixing it 1:1 with splenda. -It does not have a nasty after-taste, but it is only about 75% as sweet as sugar, so splenda comes in handy for mixing here also. This mixture does double duty since erythritol counteracts the splenda after-taste. -Erythritol is heat stable so you can bake and cook with it. -It does not get syrupy or sticky like sugar. -It does not really caramelize like sugar. -Some cookies still have that cooling effect even with the splenda mixture. -It is possible to make powdered sugar by throwing it in the blender and blending for a bit. -It does not dissolve as easily as sugar in cold drinks. Some good things to note. -Does not give stomach problems like other alcohol sugars. -It does not cause tooth decay. -The calorie count is .2 per gram, so it is virtually calorie free and truly low carb. -It does not raise blood sugar. -It is not known for stalling weight loss on low carb. programs.

 Very Hot Cayenne Pepper,5,"If you are looking for cayenne pepper that really packs a punch, this is it. I have been taking cayenne to try and improve blood circulation to my hands and feet. I have Type 1 diabetes and am concerned about the long term effects of this disease. Honestly I hate taking this stuff, but I definitely feel the benefits I am looking for, not sure if it is improved blood circulation or the anti-inflammatory properties of cayenne....or if these 2 properties go hand in hand, but my hands, feet and overall body condition feels consistently better (except for the discomfort of the first 20 minutes) when I take my daily morning dose. Here is what I do. I put about an inch of warm water in a glass, add about a teaspoon of honey, then I add about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, then add about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne (90K SHU), stir and....gulp! I only use a little bit of water so that I can gulp it down. The honey and the lemon juice mask some of the power of the pepper. I have heard that you build up a tolerance to this stuff...I have been taking this for about a month now, daily, and I have not been able to move beyond a 1/4 teaspoon without painful consequences.

 Taste and Price Pleaser,5,"I had been ordering another instant espresso coffee, but when I went to make and new order I found the price had almost tripled! Wow! What a shock! A little research and I found that there was a recent new owner of the company and, apparently, they were looking for a quick profit on their investment. I also found out that this price increase was the cause of my local grocers no longer carrying that ""gold"" Italian labeled product. My usual routine is to fresh grind my coffee beans and use a french press to brew my morning coffee. I enjoy a full bodied strength more like a European than American weaker flavored coffee. Ferrara was a good choice for my individual taste. I own an espresso machine and make my own brew on occasions and, of course, that is the best.

 NOT THE ORIGINAL!!,1,"WARNING!! These are no longer made by Jelly Belly!! When they first came out, Jelly Belly handled them and they were great, yes even the nasty flavors...well, at least they were authentically flavored anyway. Now, evidently the folks at Warner Bros. decided to go cheap after the license ran out for jelly Belly. These new ones by some candy company I've never heard of are HORRIBLE. Even the ones that are supposed to taste good. They don't taste much like what they're supposed to and we had trouble figuring out what flavor was what. These don't taste much better than the cheapo jelly beans you can find at Easter. I had assumed based on the similar packaging that they were the same. The odd shaped little uglies should have given me a clue...Jelly Belly NEVER puts those in with their regular beans. Unless you're just into torturing your palette, steer clear of these rip-offs.

 Tastes good and good for you,5,"When a cereal's description contains a term like ""fiber twigs"" you might be tempted to throw the box down and run away.

What the heck, I figured, if it doesn't taste good I don't have to buy it again. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried GOLEAN and it tasted great! I was also happy at how satisfied I felt after finishing a bowl; it was filling and nutritious and gave me plenty of energy to get through the morning.

" Culinary teas bulk matcha vs. ""tea ceremony quality"" matcha",4,"I am new to matcha drinking, so was somewhat concerned re: customer comments Culinary Teas matcha being ""brown"" (i.e. a not the correct bright green color). I had only tried Starbucks Matcha (PLEASE BE ADVISED - it is very tasty, but probably because the number one ingredient on the label is sugar). Also, a pound of Starbucks Matcha (as sold on a popular auction site) costs about the same as a pound of Culinary Teas bulk Matcha)...so you are getting far less of the expensive and healthful green tea powder and more sugar (the Starbucks product is somehow micronized so it does mix into solution much easier than a less processed pure tea powder). The teaspoon on the right is Teavana (at $16 for 30 grams - thats 2 Tbsp) they said it was the highest ""tea ceremony"" quality matcha. The teaspoon on the left is the bulk (1 lb, silver bag) CT product. Photo taken without a flash and not retouched so actual colors show. CT matcha is slightly less brilliant green. I mixed exact quantities (1/2 tsp) of matcha in 8 oz of liquid with exact quantities of sweetener (a blend of xylitol and stevia that I am experimenting with). The CT matcha tastes slightly less ""green"" and slightly more bitter than the Teavana, but I did the math ( a pound of CT would cost $240 at the Teavana $16 per 30 g cost) - so I am very happy with my CT purchase. Will use the smaller container for my ""working"" supply, freeze the rest and use as needed. Am finding Matcha to be a great substitute for my ""too much coffee"" habit and prefer the less instantaneous (but prolonged) energy boost it gives - not too mention alkalizing instead of acidifying, ECGC, and possible metabolism boosting effect. PS Most Starbucks barristas do not know the Matcha powder contains sugar, so they will tell you the are not adding any. As consumers, we need to ask companies to STOP ADDING SUGAR (in whatever processed form it takes) to everything they make. …",58 out of 60 users found this review helpful

 VeggieDent chews are much better AND SAFER than HEXtra chews,5,"Our vet recommended getting ""C.E.T. chews"" to help clean our dog's teeth, so I looked around online and came across the VeggieDent chews and the HEXtra premium chews. Both of these met the requirement of being ""C.E.T chews"" but they looked (and sounded from the description) very different from each other, so I wasn't sure what kind to buy. Based on the reviews for each, it still wasn't clear what would work better, so I ordered one pack of each. I was worried that the VeggieDent chews would too easily be consumed and therefore wouldn't do much for cleaning her teeth, and I was worried that the HEXtra chews would be a choking hazard because they wouldn't come apart easily enough and she might swallow them whole. The VeggieDent chews were definitely easy for her to break pieces off of, but she was quite happy doing so, and it took her about 15s or maybe a bit more to eat it. She chewed each little piece that broke off while she ate it, and it was definitely cleaning her teeth. The HEXtra chews, however, are a choking hazard, and I will never give her another one. She was very excited to get the HEXtra chew (they smell terrible but apparently good to a dog) and chewed on it for a second or two, and then in one quick gulp it was gone. The whole chew, still in one piece. It was in her mouth for about 2 seconds. She is a VERY strong chewer (she can take chunks off of a black kong easily in 30 seconds or so, and she's a medium-large dog), and had no desire to chew pieces off of the HEXtra chew, I'm guessing because the moistened chew seemed like something to be swallowed whole. The HEXtra chews were useless for cleaning her teeth and a choking hazard, and I would never give her another one. In summary, the VeggieDent chews were great for cleaning our dog's teeth (though they didn't last particularly long, but if you're looking for something to last long, try a kong product), while the HEXtra chews did nothing for our dog's teeth and were also a choking hazard because she swallowed it whole within a second or two. Note: I've posted this review for the HEXtra chews as well, in case it's useful for people who may be debating between these two types of C.E.T. chews. …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 A blend of Erythritol and Stevia,3,"On the plus side, Truvia for me is a very good tasting low-calorie sugar substitute. Does it taste exactly like sugar? No. But for me it tastes better than Sweet & Low, Equal, and even Splenda. The problem I have with Truvia -- and hence just the three stars -- is that it is not just a sweetener made with from a stevia extract. The other major sweetening ingredient contained in Truvia is erythritol, a sugar alcohol. Unlike stevia that has a history of 30+ years of safe use (with no major bad side effects) in Japan, there's nothing much known about the safety and long-term effects of taking large and repeated doses of erythritol. Erythritol has simply not been tested a whole lot. So one is rolling the dice with Truvia, hoping that there's no long-term negative consequences of ingesting so much erythritol on a daily basis (if one is using Truvia regularly for their morning coffee or tea). If one is drawn to using a stevia-based low calorie sweetener for the known safety record of stevia (as demonstrated in Japan), then it would be wise to use a stevia sweetener that does NOT contain erythritol. Unfortunately, Truvia does. On the other hand, if one is only concerned about the taste of the low calorie sweetener, then Truvia is a fine choice in that regard. …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful

" Superior Touch, Please advise if there is ANY MSG in your product",1,"I have been using the Better Than Bouillon Vegetable Base for years. I was in the process of ordering additional jars, when I read Ms Hill's comment, from December, 2008. I reviewed the Ingredients listed on the jar and researched yeast extract and maltodextrin. There are very good articles on line, that explain how MSG can be ""hidden"", in the list of ingredients. The articles indicate there are over 40 food ingredients besides ""monosodium glutamate"" that contain processed free glutamic acid (MSG). It appears that autolyzed yeast extract and maltodextrin are two of those food ingredients. In addition, ""NO MSG ADDED"" does not mean that there is NO MSG in the product. If MSG is ""processed into"" a product as opposed to being ""poured into"" a product (just a matter of a different processing method), then a company can declare ""NO MSG ADDED"" or ""NO ADDED MSG"", even though the product contains MSG.

Until now I have been using tahini I bought at the nearby supermarket, and I always thought that the bitterness I tasted was just a natural part of the tahini. The Al-Wadi has nothing but pure nutty creaminess and no bitterness. I also noticed that it is runnier than what I usually get, indicating that it has a higher oil content and also that it was in fresher condition than what I had been buying. It had not had time to settle out and clump up at the bottom - so it's easier to use. Buying it this way is also much cheaper than what I have been getting at the store.

You can add vinegar to make seasoned sushi rice for your own sushi, make rice ****, serve with vegetables or protein or just eat as is. Reasonably priced given the convenience. These are becoming a staple around our house. They can be the basis for a quick lunch,a nice side dish or a foundation/element of much more elaborate preparations. We put this in lettuce wraps with some leftover duck and a few seasonings and had a very elegant and successful snack for unexpected visitors. One bowl usually serves two normal appetites or one very large, very Hungry, man quite nicely, I've added this to soups and stir fries etc. and one bowl was actually enough to serve three or four people when used that way. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Special corn translates to special polenta,5,"Hello. My name is Carl Mundt and I am the President of the company that produces de la Estancia organic polenta in Argentina - I'm obviously biased so you can take my comments with a grain of salt if you want. A little more than 10 years ago, my wife and I decided to invest in the Argentine farming business. We found two young Argentine farmers to be our partners and we began to grow different crops. I also started to learn something about farming - I was especially interested in the crops themselves. After a few years I realized that the corn we were growing was quite different from the corn I was used to seeing in the US and Europe. Argentine corn is a subtropical corn called ""long cycle"" which meant that it grows in the fields for 6 months as opposed to the 3 month growing cycle of common corn. It was also extremely happy corn because the nights in the foothills of the Andes are cool and, besides lots of rain and hot sunshine, corn likes cool nights. This special type of corn is much harder, more vividly yellow and has both a much lower starch content and a higher protein level than corn from more temperate climates. Putting two and two together I realized that polenta made from Argentine corn would be far superior to polenta made from common corn. It would be brighter yellow in color and it could be ground to a finer consistency. But most important, the low starch level meant that our polenta would cook in just one minute. It cooks so fast because there is basically no starch to incorporate into the cooking liquid. That is what takes so long in cooking other polentas. I also want to emphasize that our polenta is not pre-cooked as is the case for the polenta in the tubes. Nor it is partially pre-cooked and then reconstituted as is the case for the ""instant"" polentas. De la Estancia polenta is pure ground corn that has never been processed or treated in any way. It just cooks fast naturally. I hope that you enjoy preparing and serving our polenta as much as I have enjoyed bringing it to the US. …",20 out of 21 users found this review helpful

" True to the commercial, but caffeine amount is questionable.",4,"As a person who has never consumed a cup of coffee or other energy drink before in his life, I can't say for certain just how effective 5-hour energy is in comparison. I can say that it worked, though -- my God, did it work. Having drunk merely half the bottle, I felt energized and ready to roll in three or four minutes. The product was true to its label in that I was able to study with concentration from 12 o'clock to 5 with no ""afternoon slump"" or ""jitters""(though for a time I did experience a subtle tingling in my fingers). When my five hours were up, I came back to normal and didn't feel any side effects or ""caffeine crash"". The product is not addictive: I bought a pack of twelve bottles a month ago and still haven't used them all. 5-hour energy should be used with wisdom, however -- the manufacturers say that it contains ""no more caffeine than a cup of coffee"" but doesn't specify the size of the cup. It took me an hour longer than normal to get to sleep when I drank a whole bottle. That said, I have no other complaints to offer of this excellent energy drink. I suggest taking half of a bottle whenever you need a boost of concentration or motivation, as that is usually sufficient. Also, drink these only when you need to -- it's potent stuff, and I wager those little bottles can disappear quickly. 5-hour energy is a great resource for workouts, daily business, and the hurly-burly of modern life.

 Give it time,5,"I adopted a dog that was raised by a bunch of frat age boys. You can imagine the diet she had; Burgers, fries, ice-cream, and the cheapest dog foods on the market. No, she wasn't crazy about Newman's dog food when I switched her to it. But if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense. It takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there. It has been almost a year. My dog, Molly, is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free. She gets dry Newman's fed free style, and 4 ounces of Newman's canned every day. Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week. On another note, this diet has made doggy duty much easier. She never vomits anymore. Her scat is always firm, making her easy to clean up after. She is regular as clock-work.

My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer. It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut. I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).

 Great Product,5,"We took in a starving little ferrel kitten almost 2 years ago that we eventually discovered has digestive problems and allergies to corn, wheat, soy and fillers.. We live in a rural area where we don't have a lot of choices in pet foods. We kept trying all kinds of natural foods available at Walmart, Kmart, etc., trying to find one that worked for him, but nothing worked. We finally found Diamond's natural's at our local Tractor Supply and decided to give it a try.. It's the one that worked! Our little ""pew"" kitty is now pretty much gas free, his cat box isn't full of it (if you get my drift) and he's doing beautifully. He's a huge cat with silky smooth long hair. On the plus side, Diamond Natural's are made in the USA! We also switched our dog to Diamond's natural because he also has allergies to corn, wheat, soy and fillers.. His fur is thicker and softer and he isn't chewing non stop like he was before.. Plus he loves the food! We use Diamond Naturals Lamb and Rice formula for him. Don't confuse the Diamond's Maintenance with the Diamond's Natural's, though.. The Maintenance formula's do include corn and fillers...

 Fantastic Grits that Can't Be Beat (recipe included in review),5,"As a native Southerner, I've eaten grits all my life but I'd never had yellow, coarsely ground corn grits before I tried Bob's. From the moment my family tried these grits about two or three years ago, we've eaten no other grits. We cook these grits every weekend, usually Saturday and Sunday mornings. Oh, we've tried a few good regional products, but they're just not as good as Bob's (for instance, Lakeside yellow grits are good, but because they're more finely ground, Lakeside is a bit too creamy, tasting almost like a corn porridge). I prefer the more coarse grind of Bob's yellow grits, and the flavor is exceptional. The corn flavor in Bob's comes through, but not in an overpowering way - not to sound like a geek foodie, but Bob's yellow grits have a fantastic taste and mouthfeel. It's hard to explain, but I recommend you try them. If you're not sure you want to bite off a bulk multi-bag purchase via Superstore, then check your local grocery store (Publix in the Southeast carries Bob's, as do many organic/gourmet grocers). Regarding price: Bob's Red Mill products aren't cheap, but the company fills a very unique niche (Gluten-free products, unusual flours, etc.) and I'm willing to pay the price to keep the company from disappearing. Plus, every product from Bob's Red Mill that I've ever tried has been superior, including these grits. Oh, and NEVER follow the cooking directions on a bag or box of grits - that's the primary reason non-Southerners think grits are nasty, because they make grits without the necessary amounts of butter, salt and milk or cream. Also, these are not quick cook grits, so it will take about 15-20 minutes from the time the water boils to achieve smooth, cooked grits. To feed four people (assuming you also have pancakes and a meat for breakfast), use three cups water brought to a boil, then gently shake about 2/3 cup of grits into the water. Once the water/grits combo comes to a boil, immediately lower the heat to simmer and stir frequently. [A note about lumps: if you don't stir often enough, you get lumps; if you dump the grits in, rather than shaking them in slowly, you get lumps.] Add two or three tablespoons of salted butter, then an unholy amount of salt. I'm afraid to measure how much salt we actually use (we salt to taste as we cook), but I would guess we use two or more teaspoons of salt. To avoid oversalting, start with one teaspoon of salt, taste when you're almost done, then add additional milk and salt to taste. Depending on how thick you like your grits, add additional water (we prefer to use 1% milk) to thin them out a bit. You can also add chopped bacon or country ham to your final product for flavor. A word about polenta: Any Southerner can tell you that grits left in a pot to cool become polenta... so go ahead, and impress your Yankee and West Coast friends by ""grilling up"" leftover slices of your breakfast for dinner. Remember, the Americas introduced corn to Europe (including Italy), so grits came first. …",64 out of 65 users found this review helpful

 Pomegranate Izze Cans Don't Measure Up to Izze in Bottles.,3,"Izze Sparkling Pomegranate is one of my favorite fruit sodas, and I'm rarely without a few bottles in the house. When I ordered the Sparking Pomegranate in cans, I expected it to be a very similar product. Izze sparking juices in cans are called ""Izze Fortified"", because, unlike the bottled drinks, they are fortified with vitamins C (6 mg), B6 (0.2 mg), and Niacin (2 mg). That's 10% of the USRDA for those vitamins, an insignificant amount. But I wondered if the addition of vitamins would change the taste or if the aluminum can would impart a minerally flavor. I'm not sure what changed the taste, to tell the truth. Apart from the vitamins, the ingredients are the same as in bottled Izze. The vitamin C is in the form of ascorbic acid, but too scant to affect flavor. I'm not fond of very sweet things, so I love the sweet-tart taste of pomegranate. Izze Sparkling Pomegranate is the best pomegranate soda that I've tasted, because it tastes more like fresh pomegranate than pomegranate juice. The Izze Fortified Sparkling Pomegranate goes beyond tart into bitter, however, and it's not nearly as carbonated as the Izze in bottles. This is more of a slightly sparkling juice than a fruit soda. It may be that the sweeter flavors of Izze fare better in cans. I suspect that the reduced carbonation is concentrating the pomegranate flavor to poor effect. This stuff tastes flat to me as well as bitter. Sparkling Grapefruit is another tart favorite, so I don't think I'll try that in cans either. These are small 8.4 oz cans that are easy for someone with small hands to grasp but hold significantly less beverage than a traditional 12 oz drink can. They would be great for the pool or beach, where glass bottles are prohibited, if only the contents tasted better. If you're an Izze fan, stick with the bottles. The Izze Fortified just isn't refreshing in pomegranate. …",9 out of 12 users found this review helpful

San Franciscan's have always enjoyed a diverse bounty of culinary experiences and it's always a challenge to replicate the great recipes at home. I was hoping this product would accomplish that. while quite flavorful, the overall taste is burdened with way too much salt (not authentic proportion) so, like the other 3 star reviewer, I added one half can of coconut milk.

It makes no sense to buy this when a regular ""adult"" steamer (such as the Black & Decker I reviewed) with a basket 4x the size is $30! I make my own baby food and love having a large basket to cook 4 sweet potatoes at once or a whole bag of baby carrots and freezing the extra portions in ice cube trays. With the Babycook, one would have to steam & puree almost every day -- who has the time? Secondly, with many baby foods, you have to remove the skins after steaming anyway, so it completely defeats the purpose of steaming & pureeing in the same basket. Lastly, when doing some reasearch into this product, I found that it may leech BPA chemicals so please look into this if it is important to you. All in all, I think the Babycook looks adorable and has a cute little name and packaging but if you are a busy, tired mom, do yourself a big favor and get a regular, adult-sized steamer (like the B&D) that can make a month of purreed baby food at a time to freeze and re-heat when needed.

 According to CNN's report on VitaCoCo....,2,"(update)According to an article on CNN on 8/5/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the label. ""Researchers at ConsumerLab tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients. The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., almost matched the label. But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount."" I ordered two to try out from Superstore but while waiting on the delivery, I was out shopping when I observed a lot of companies were suddenly cashing out on coconut milk/water! I bought one brand-name from Lucky's Super Market and another brand from Walgreen's next door. Being of Polynesian heritage and homegrown from the islands but living on the mainland, I thought, ""Hmmm..all these centuries coconuts been around, suddenly its being pitched as nutritional & interesting. Let's see what the catch is"". Both were almost $3.00 but only a particular brand I bought at Lucky's taste like REAL COCONUT MILK 'WATER/Milk' right out the coconut. In Asia, coconut milk comes from ""soaking the flesh of the older coconut"". But I'm not from Asia which is why I call it coconut milk & not coconut water right of the coconut. Finally, VitaCoCo came. I tasted it and spit it right out. It didnt taste like coconut water to our family 'at all'. Then I looked to see where it was produced. Before I go further let me explain something to those who may not know. Agriculture for fruits are always better on tropical islands, or from the Caribbean islands. You won't find any fruits more richer in juice or sweeter anywhere else in the world. Vita CoCo says it is produced by a company in Latin America, Brazil. Produced for All Markets Inc. New York, NY. My sister then poured some into a glass and screamed, ""OMG They're ripping people off! It's watered down!"" She said that because pure coconut milk has a milky color to it. Some less, some more but never crystal clear. The younger the fruit, the richer, more nutritional, and milky the coconut milk. The more mature the fruit, the sweeter & thinner the milk. As the fruit ripens the coconut water gets converted into the solid meat of the fruit. The meat then becomes more nutritional then the milk. So I told her that they weren't ripping consumers off because it says, 100% pure coconut WATER. It's either a little coconut milk diluted with a lot of pure water, or this is what Brazilian coconuts taste like (flat)? And it seems like they're using 'over-riped' coconuts. Which makes sense. Then the meat of the coconut could be sold and not tossed out. As for those who have to have potassium every night like my aunt, DO NOT rely on Vita Coco's ad. My aunt finished off the 17 fl oz of Vita CoCo and still woke up with painful side effects from taking prednisone. This is also how we knew Vita CoCo must be using over-ripe less nutritional coconuts, or watering it down. I ended up having to prepare the daily one banana she's suppose to have before bedtime. Drink mango or guava juice all! The most nutritional of all island fruits ;) …",12 out of 22 users found this review helpful

We totally recommend the soy jerky by tasty eats. We ordered six cases of the ginger. They use no onion or garlic in any of their products. Most companies do list ""spices"" but they will almost always label garlic or onion powder separately. This company who makes the primal strips does not.

 Tastes great and great for you!,5,"First off let me say that I have been eating vegetarian and soy made meals, burgers, and other concoctions for nearly half my life, from the really great tasting to the not so great tasting. So when I stumbled on this burger mix in my local bulk foods section I jumped on the chance to taste this stuff and am VERY happy I did. Making the burgers is very easy, just add the same amount of warm/hot water to burger mix, stir well, let sit for a while, then form into a patty and cook. Very simple and easy to make. What I like to do is make a bunch of the mix ahead and stick it in the fridge so you can enjoy one almost anytime you want. Now these burgers aren't meant to taste like a beef burger, I would say they are an alternative to the ""real thing"". They are well seasoned and have a great hearty texture to them. Throw them on a bun with some fixings and you have yourself a very health lunch, snack, or dinner. So in addition to my regular veggie burgers that I buy, this mix has become a staple in my health lifestyle and would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to meat or even some of those really untasty soy burgers that are out there (there are a few, I know because I ate them for years). PROS: Easy to make. Doesn't taste like beef or any of the frozen soy burgers out there, so if you don't like beef or any of those soy burgers give this stuff a try! Can be made ahead of time and stuck in the fridge. Very healthy, low sodium, yet tastes very well seasoned. Other things can be added to the mix. The mix can be added to regular hamburger to create really tasty meatloaf. CONS: If not mixed with the correct amount of water patties tend to become extremely crumbly and fall apart. …",29 out of 29 users found this review helpful
" Bold, rich coffee but not as advertised",4,"The coffee itself was great, and at less then $15 for over 3lb's it is a incredible bargain. The main thing you should know if you buy it though is that although it is categorized under whole bean coffee, it is ground. It is also ground extremely finely to the point that a good amount of the grounds pass straight through my Bodum Classic french press' filter. It's more suitable to be drip brewed then made in a press. Edit: Apparently is categorized properly under ground now. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful
" Necco, what have you done?",1,"The new Sweethearts are here. Yellow is now lemon instead of banana. Green is now apple instead of lime. There is no white heart. The pink one, formerly cherry, is now strawberry. The purple one almost tastes like the old one (medicine), but not exactly. There is a blue one and it tastes like chemicals. The taste for all of the flavors ranges from 'soap-like' to 'chemical-infused'. Why mess with a classic? Nothing was wrong with the old flavors, but this new candy is too horrible to eat.

 Poor customer service,1,"I ordered some xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very, very strange, foul smell. I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination. I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable). She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again. Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one thing since I'd never ordered from them before. I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same. Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site. While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me. I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc. Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried. I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective. NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar. They are also available here on Superstore . Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on. …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Disagree With Negative Reviews,5,"A few reviewers commented in a black & white, all or nothing, manner on the evils of agave nectar. The sources and way agave nectar are processed vary from brand to brand. Some are from blue agave, some are from other types of agave plants. Some are created by high tech chemical processing and some are processed minimally at low temperature. The Wholesome Sweetners Organic Blue Agave is (as the title indicates) made from blue agave and not other ""wild"" types that are cheaper (btw, I'm a regular Superstore consumer and have no connection with this company). ""Raw"" is a term from the raw foods movement which indicates that this product is produced by very low heat to encourage evaporation, converting the soluble fiber inulin into sugar, and not the high heat that is destroying all the enzymes and creating something chemically different. The more processed ""light agave"" does have a higher fructose content, but is that a bad thing? The ""evils"" of fructose is baffling to me. Fructose is what you get from fruit, green peppers, onions, carrots, etc. Fructose is not bad for you. However, the amount that is contained in an orange pales with the massive dose in the ""Big Gulp"" drink you get at your local convenience market. This reminds me of the bad rap for fats that the government propagandized about for years in their now proven useless nutrition pyramid that we were indoctrinated at school with when we were kids. Fats, too, are essential for your health, but overconsumption of anything (and the wrong kinds, and in the wrong combination with other foods) can be bad for you. In one ""scientific"" study people were fed large doses of ""agave nectar"" (I put that in quotes because it turns out that some of these cheap nectars - hey, studies cost money, so get the cheap stuff! - were adulterated with high fructose corn syrup and with maple syrup). Maple syrup is very yummy, but the presence of a non-agave nectar product in the thing you are supposed to be testing is what we call in the scientific world a ""confounding variable"" (read: invalid study). Additionally, I use a teaspoon of agave nectar and don't drink the bottle like it's a can of Coke. The equating of agave nectar with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is total hornswoggle. Yes, both have fructose, but as we shall see, so does pretty much most other foods we eat. The most common dietary sugars are glucose, fructose, and galactose. These are six carbon mono-saccharides and are the building blocks of most other biologically important sugars, ones that have been used by humans since recorded history. Glucose is also known as dextrose because it is a member of a broader classification of sugars known as dextrins. Dextrins are named because they bend polarized light to the right (dextrorotatory is the term chemists use to describe this physical property). Fructose is also known as laevulose because it bends polarized light to the left (levorotatory is a term chemists use to refer this physical property). By the way, where is sucrose (common table sugar) in this mix? Sucrose is simply the combination of two of the above sugars: glucose and a fructose. The point here is that you're starting to see that this so-called bad fructose is in almost all forms of sweets. Not only in sweets like candy and chocolate bars, but also in virtually every fruit such as apples, pears, berries, melons, bananas, etc. Further, fructose is also found in high amounts in apple cider vinegar, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, every carrot you've ever eaten, broccoli, cucumbers, even squash. Every whole grain has fructose. Please note that this fructose isn't placed in these vegetables and fruits by us evil manufacturers that run laboratories; this fructose is just naturally in these foods. ""Well, it's not that all fructose is bad... it's the amounts in each food that matter."" Fair enough. Let's briefly look at the amount of fructose in a 200 calorie serving of a few food items. Listed from most fructose to least: Food item / mg of fructose / Serving size standard US soda beverage / 29,760 mg / in a 200 calorie serving Applesauce, canned & sugared / 28,634 mg / in a 200 calorie serving Honey, US, supposedly awesome / 26,930 mg / in a 200 calorie serving Agave syrup, Mexico, supposedly evil / 26,896 mg / in a 200 calorie serving Apple, raw / 25,125 mg / in a 200 calorie serving Dates, raw, dried / 23,074 mg / in a 200 calorie serving Vinegar, balsamic / 16,773 mg / in a 200 calorie serving Strawberries, raw / 15,247 mg / in a 200 calorie serving This information above comes from the USDA's National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. You can go there and get this info on any food you want. What does this mean? Unless you're living on 100% meat, fructose is a part of the human food chain. It always has been, and will continue to be a part of your diet. Demonizing it is illogical. Some proponents are against agave because they have their own agenda (e.g. one critic is hawking his own healthy honey on his website, which as you can see has slightly more fructose than agave nectar, so what's his illogical point about agave and fructose?). Plus, I don't eat a 200 calorie serving of agave nectar. I use a squirt in my coffee. I'm getting less fructose than what's in an average apple. Let's demonize apples now because they're worse than agave nectar! Fructose has received much negative attention due to the fact that fructose can be converted into fat in the liver. The process of converting fructose into fat is related to the way the fructose is absorbed -- unlike other dietary sugars, fructose is not actively transported into the bloodstream by transport proteins. Instead, fructose -- be it from the banana you ate this morning, the squash soup you had last night, the Coconut Bliss that's in your freezer, or the delicious honey you just dripped into you tea -- is passively absorbed into portal circulation from the GI tract. Portal circulation sends dietary fructose to the liver for further processing. It sends *all* fructose this way. But here's where the anti-agave writers get it wrong. First, there are plenty of things we eat that get processed mainly by the liver; lipids and proteins are just two examples. Secondly, like those fats and proteins, the outcome of fructose in the liver isn't fixed. It can have a number of different fates: 1) it can be consumed as fuel (during times of great energy demand), 2) it can be converted to glucose and released as blood sugar (during times of energy demand and low blood sugar), 3) it can be converted to glucose and converted into glycogen for storage (under well fed state following energy depleted state), 4) it can be used as a reducing source for production of NADPH for reductive synthesis (biological molecules are built by reductive synthesis). Or, god forbid, 5) it can be converted into fat in the form of triglycerides (overfed state where fructose is not necessary for any other functions and blood triglycerides are low). To simply state that fructose is converted to fat is a gross oversimplification of biochemistry. It's a salesman's pitch. The conversion of fructose to fats as free fatty acids in the liver and ultimately release of fats from the liver as triglycerides requires a specific dietary condition. In biochemistry, it is called ""the well-fed state"" (that's the actual scientific phrase). In layman terms for you and I, we call this the ""you're eating too much, pal, so stop blaming specific food components for your problem"" state. This well-fed state of extreme elevation of blood triglycerides is seen in populations that consume very high amounts of saturated fats, and carbohydrates, with simple sugars as the major component of total carbohydrate. Agave contains a fructooligiosaccharide (FOS) known as inulin. Inulin has been shown to have numerous positive impacts on human health due to the propensity for it to increase the population of beneficial bacteria such as acidophilus and bifidus in the human gastro-intestinal tract. One of the many positive benefits these bacteria provide is the reduction in triglyceride production in the liver. Fructose has been suggested to be a possible safe alternative for type II diabetics because fructose has a low glycemic index, and has even been shown to reduce hemoglobin A1c (a marker of long term loss of glycemic control). Small quantities of fructose have been shown to even have a blunting effect on the glycemic response of high glycemic starches (Heacock, Hertzer and Wolf J. Nutr. 132: 2601-2604, 2002). The debate over the relationship between dietary carbohydrate and serum lipid levels is not a new one. Several studies conducted in the 1960's and 1970's showed a relation between a high sugar (50%) and increased triglyceride levels. Two bestseller books took this idea and ran with it. The books were ""Sugar Blues"" and ""Sweet and Dangerous"". The studies cited by the authors were short in duration (2-6 weeks), this may have led the authors to assume a false conclusion. This prompted more studies. In later studies that were longer in duration (3-6 months) it was noted that triglyceride levels normalized. This is not to say that a 50% sugar diet is safe or sane. Far from it. However, it does show that making quick conclusions from a small number of studies can lead to false perceptions. The purpose of pointing all this out is to encourage a rational examination of the safety of common sweeteners. You only need to look at healthy old people (or my own, or your own experience with agave) to see that sweeteners used in moderation are fine for human health. Sweeteners can be included in many diets with no adverse health effects, assuming the diet is rich in complex carbohydrates, quality fats (especially essential fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids) and quality lean protein. If you are consuming massive amounts of simple sugars, with saturated fats, low fiber, and poor quality proteins, then the least of your problems is the agave syrup. Instead, the pharmaceutical industry and your local emergency room are ready and waiting. Agave is not HFCS. Apples, bananas, and figs, although high in fructose, are also not HFCS. Debra Lynn Dadd, a consumer advocate who writes for the New York Times covers this topic as well at[...]. Interestingly, she and her husband did their own mini-test where they tried various brands of agave syrup and tested the rise in blood sugar with their own blood glucose meter. This brand above brought the least blood sugar rise of any brands they tested (obviously, this is a limited test and we all vary). In reality, as far as blood sugar results, who cares what some lab does with a bunch of other people with unique body chemistries? Get a small bottle of this (and a couple others), get out your blood glucose meter and do your own test. Your own test with your own body is the only one that counts anyway. Any other lab tests are just general indicators. ""Your mileage may vary"" as the saying goes. Yes, there is a difference between brands. Some have been adulterated with high fructose syrup and one study (one of the negative ones) found the dark ""agave syrup"" was actually adulterated with maple syrup (which, while yummy, is sort of getting away from the reason why you're buying agave nectar in the first place). Caveat emptor is always a wise policy. You can go to the manufacturer of this product for more information as to nutrition, where it comes from, what it contains, and how it's produced [...]. This is Mexican blue agave and not something else which other brands may use. Raw agave nectar is heated gently (usually around 118 degrees) and converts the inulin in the agave to the sweet product we are looking for. By this manufacturers description their light agave is heated to 165 degrees and converts the inulin to fructose, so it does have a higer fructose content that the raw does not. Thus, in my humble opinion, I think I'm going to stick with the raw (which I like the taste in my coffee and adds some tasty caramel notes). …",19 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Looks like a winner,5,"I'm a serious label-reader, even more so for my cat than for myself, so before I ordered Petite Cuisine, I went to their website to see what they had to say for themselves. I was pleased to read that they use no wheat gluten in their food, nor meat by-products; neither belongs in pet food. They also make a point of saying that they use no products from China. It's a reassurance I appreciate in the light of the recent spate of pet deaths linked to product coming out of China. What they do use was also reassuring. White meat chicken, veggies, olive or soybean oils, vitamins and minerals. The sesame chicken does contain rice which isn't something that should necessarily be fed often, but it's a minor consideration. While it's never said that the ingredients are ""human grade"" they are listed as safe for humans to eat. I don't know about anyone else but I wouldn't want to feed my pets anything that wasn't safe for me to eat. The carton arrived and was marked as ""Product of Thailand"" which was a bit of a surprise since no mention of Thailand appears on their site. They are, however, quick to point out that no child labor is used in production of any of the food. (It's also listed as ""dolphin safe."" This is a pretty politically correct company.) Of course the proof of the pudding, or in this case, the cat food, is the eating. My response as I opened the cans was the the sesame chicken looked and smelled very tempting. The chicken pot pie, not so much. It smells wonderful, but is very watery. Again, this is a minor consideration. If my cat likes it, that's the important thing. He's a picky boy, in part because he can't eat beef or lamb, so he's limited to poultry and certain types of fish. He doesn't tend to like the souped-up, holistic foods that add things like rosemary and acai and all those things which humans so cheerfully add to their own foods. But this stuff is pretty basic, and, well let's just say, he doesn't hate it. I can probably add it to the rotation without causing much consternation, and know that he's getting a quality meal. Your mileage -- or your cat's -- may vary, of course. Cats are perverse little beasts, and you just never know what they're going to take violent dislike to. I can't tell you if your cat will like this food or not, but I can tell you that it looks like quality product made by people who have high standards. Yes, it's pricey, but if you feel, as I do, that your cat deserves the consideration you'd give to any member of the family, you probably won't balk at the cost. The rest is up to your cat. …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 This is trash. This is not food.,1,"Check out the nutrition facts right below the product name on the Superstore page. Is the manufacturer hoping that uninformed consumers have heard the word Omega somewhere and think that it's necessarily good for them? Nature's Path does not tell us which Omega 6s or Omega 3s it contains. Beneficial Omega 3s are those that we get from foods such as tuna and flax. Omega 6s are generally what we get from corn-fed stockyard beef. Or from sitting down and swigging a bottle of peanut oil. Note that this product contains 900 mg of Omega 6s and 400 mg of Omega 3s. More than twice as much of Omega 6s as Omega 3s. The typical, god-awful American diet contains a ratio of 20:l Omega 6s to Omega 3s. Nutritional scientists recommend that we drop this diet and try to get at least a 3:1 ration of Omega 3s to Omega 6s. Large studies are indicating that Omega 3s help the cardiovascular system, reduce inflammation, may have a helpful role in preventing cancer, improve depression in some people and may possibly be helpful in preventing or stabilizing some forms of dementias. Are these studies far enough along to be conclusive? No. Are they pointing us in some healthy directions? Yes. Are positive results encouraging more studies - not just lab studies, but human studies? Yes. The most positive results so far indicate that Omega 3s are very good for our hearts. So, you get 2 grams of fiber from a product that supposedly contains granola, flax seed, raisins, hemp seeds and sunflower seeds. What are they using these fiber-rich foods for? The box? You also get 100 mg of sodium and 14 - FOURTEEN - grams! of sugar, along with some saturated fat.

 Less is more,3,I purchased liquid stevia in an effort to use more natural sugars in my baking. I tried simply replacing white sugar with liquid stevia in my favorite recipes. I went to Sweet Leaf's website and used their conversion chart. I found that 1 tsp of liquid stevia for every 1 cup of sugar was too much. The intial taste was ok but had a strong aftertaste that stayed in your mouth for awhile. I later tried recipes specifically calling for liquid stevia. These recipes tasted quite good and typically used less liquid stevia. …,16 out of 19 users found this review helpful
" misleading description, but okay product",3,"According to the description, the first two ingredients are spinach and peas, but when the item arrived I saw that the first ingredient was actually apples. I bought this thinking it was going to be primarily spinach, but that wasn't the case. I was rather disappointed, but overall these were fine. My daughter ate them happily. We used these with the ""Plum Organics Dispensing Spoons"". They're really convenient for when we're out and about.

 Italian Pocket Coffee-Benissimo,2,"I lived in Italy for 5 years and became addicted to this espresso confection. The problem is, you can only get it in the winter months, and it has been hard to find stateside. As I found via Superstore, I felt it would be a good deal. Truth be told, the day after I ordered, I found twice the quantity on Ebay for only $15.00 more directly from a Ebay store in Germany. I bet you can guess where I will be buying from next year! If you love Pocket Coffee, check out Ebay 1st. …",8 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Curiosity got the better of me.,4,"I'm a chemist so I guess the test tubes caught my eye. I've been perfecting my cooking skills and figuring out what to fill my pantry with. I was prone to scoff at fancy sea salt admirers but my father did once have me taste one of his friend's salt company salt, dug up somewhere in Utah that contained lots of minerals besides sodium and it was indeed more complex and interesting than normal salt. And smoked salt? What is that?! Well, to find out, even in NYC would have involved buying lots of big bottles of the stuff, likely over time so I would lack a real sense of whether I was missing out on something special. That said, most of these taste about the same but may differ a bit in texture. Most are too coarse to imagine sprinkling on prepared food without grinding. The difference in coarseness makes wet finger dip comparisons imprecise. So I used a mortar to grind them for comparison. Most are not a harsh as normal table salt, but over half do translate to ""just salt"" after an initial second long delay as a slight mineral taste is noticed (perhaps!). I say perhaps, since no, few of the unsmoked ones taste noticeably different than normal salt. Even the pitch black unsmoked one (a great gimmick for a transparent table salt grinder at least). One tastes pleasantly ""fishy"". The smoked salts differ the most and are the most interesting by far and are quite different from each other. When ground in a mortar, you can tell it's just a surface coating, but they are much nicer than liquid smoke flavor, and the flavor survives just fine when ground. The most intense smoked one (Hickory) is now my favorite addition to bulky salad (olives, cheese, radish sprouts, sour cream, bamboo shoots, roast pepita seeds, horseradish, Worcestershire, sesame oil). It's an aftertaste, actually, that noticeably builds up, making each bite more dynamic. Their aroma is intense too and has its own dynamic. I'm delighted that I can buy hickory smoked salt in bulk now! It might be overkill for some dishes though. Alas, I have not in fact discovered a whole palette of flavors, just various textures and discolorations of salt, with much difficulty in figuring out which if any are favorites. Most are quite better than normal salt since for some reason when similarly ground, normal salt comes on way too fast. I can rule out about a third which translate to ""just as harshly one dimensional as table salt"". On scrambled eggs, it's a tough call. The serious division between ""harsh"" and ""subtle"" is stark, but I don't notice much variation of subtlety. Another big difference is between highly crystalline vs. ""wet"" samples. They may not actually be full of moisture but may just have more types of ingredients than just sodium chloride so have failed to crystallize as pure salt prior to being mined, but the ""wet"" ones would not work well in a table grinder at all. The bottles are labeled as to each samples uses (finishing, table, cooking). As a product, it would make a great gift, and in fact was packaged as a gift, with burlap sacks tied with twine. The labels are high quality bare paper. As an avid cook, I'd have been blown over had anybody given me this as a gift. I give it four stars since it did not come with what would have been most interesting off all: a brochure explaining the origin and rough mineral content of each sample. The ""fishy"" one has sulfur in the name, and the taste fits that description. Next step: after quickly discarding the obvious poseurs (merely pretty colored samples that lack any subtlety), a process of elimination! I don't intend to keep this kit, despite the social fun it might be, but to in fact toss one tube at a time until I'm down to only one or two smoked versions and only one table salt alternative, with the sulfur one needing separate consideration. I can't taste the sulfur one on eggs, for obvious reason that they are already sulfurous. It's way too hard to compare one to another, and crazy too, since A/B variations would number in the thousands, but quite easy to compare one at a time to normal salt, so that's why I'll do, to get rid of as many as possible. That last thing I'm interested in is fooling myself, so if half my salad or eggs or whatever routine meal I make doesn't taste truly superior with a given tube's contents, out it goes! I predict, after this second day of playing around that I will quickly eliminate a tube or two a day until it becomes more a consideration of texture and availability of a single normal salt alternative. I am almost completely convinced that normal salt really does pack too much punch due to lack of other ionic minerals in the product. My taste buds got too overwhelmed trying to solve the puzzle in one day. What fun, to do taste tests every day for days going on weeks! …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Perfect Cocoa,5,"Everyone in my family likes hot cocoa. I was running plain water through my k-cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids didn't really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow. So I decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time. No overflow. The taste is good, its creamy with enough cocoa to water ratio for my kids. I will be ordering this product from now on for my family. In the interest of product comparison, we have ordered Timothy's white hot chocolate, and Green Mountain Hot cocoa, Timothy's was great, but pricy, and Green Mountain didn't really taste all that great to our family. It had a watered down taste to it. …",21 out of 23 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 15 users found this review helpful
