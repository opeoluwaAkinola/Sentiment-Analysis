 Rice Krispies Treats Cereal. Best Thing. EVER,5,"First off i was a bit weary due to other reviews sayin the cereal was expiring soon. My cereal came packed very well, 4 boxes of beautiful rice krispies treats cereal which didnt expire for about 8 months. opening the first box was epic...those first big chunks were huge! and despite shipping the cereal was in great condition. Now, as someone who eats cereal once maybe twice a week, i tell you this. all 4 boxes were gone in a week. This cereal is simply AMAZING. childhood memory lane. i ordered frankenberry and booberry afterwards too, but this cereal is 10x better then both. Fortunately, i found a specialty store which carries this cereal :) but had i not, i would be spending alot more money on Superstore. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Greenies are not digestible -your puppy will vomit and have diarrhea and will get very sick,1,"I made the mistake to give a Greeny to my puppy without reading reviews about this product. It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea. I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"". I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days. After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie! At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies. In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog. …",9 out of 19 users found this review helpful
" Most of the sweet, none of the yuk",4,"I can taste artificial sweeteners from across the street. Hate the stuff. In a restaurant I sent a Coke back three times because they kept bringing me Diet, assuring me it was the real thing. After the third time I suggested they check their hoses. Sure enough, they were switched. Hate the stuff. One sip and my mouth says, ""Yuk!"" for hours. This doesn't even get into the fact that aspertame isn't fit for human consumption. Enter Xylitol. I bought a box of packets to use at the office where I drink coffee. I find I need two Xylitol packs to replace one sugar. No matter. It tastes fine. I detect no aftertaste. And it's actually good for my teeth and blood sugar level. This is something I can like! My only complaint was the shipping packaging. The box of packets was stuffed into an envelope which, of course, arrived flattened. Packets were all over the inside. I reformed the box and reloaded it.

 I am so disappointed with this company - buyer BEWARE indeed,1,"After reading the reviews here stating that the Iron content of Ella's Kitchen Spinach packs was incorrect, I checked out their website to see for myself. Hmm.. no announcement there stating that an error had been made. So, I contacted the company wondering if it was a misunderstanding. No, it's true. The Spinach flavor only has 4-6% DV of Iron... NOT 120% as has been clearly indicated on the pouches I have been buying for my son for OVER A YEAR! I have been purchasing these packs by the case thinking that if my son did not eat enough other Fe-rich foods on a particular day, at least he would eat this. I mean you know how difficult it can be to get little ones to take in enough iron, so I thought this was a great option. IF I HAD KNOWN that it only contained 4 or 6%, then I would have given my son other additional Fe-rich foods or continued making my own purees. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true when I noticed that the first ingredient is in fact APPLES not Spinach as the front of the pouches would have you believe. What upsets me the most is that there is not even a warning or announcement on Superstore or at Target stores stating that there has been a mistake?!! If the company knows, why isn't this info passed on to the consumer?!!? Here I thought I was purchasing (a more expensive) but also more nutritionally complete product for my baby and to find out it's just as void of nutrients as all of the other brands on the shelves. I really thought this company was exciting and different and focused on kids' nutrition and health. I guess not. I am asking for a refund at the very least. Honestly, the company is lucky if parents don't decide to take up a lawsuit for their negligence in getting the word out. The incorrectly labeled packs should be recalled like anything else- not left on the shelves to trick parents! Normally, I am not one to overact and am certainly not litigious in the least.

 Unpleasant Chemical Taste and Sensation,1,"In reading the other reviews for Red Vines, it seems to be a product one either loves passionately or hates passionately, with very little middle ground. My order from Superstore is my first time trying Red Vines, and I'm not particularly loyal to any other brand, so here's my honest opinion on them. I'll typically have Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6) because that's what's readily available in the supermarkets around here, or occasionally I'll have Country Licorice, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 4) when it's available at the local Costco. I'll basically eat the Twizzlers because they're convenient, and the Lucky Country stuff because it's really good. I was looking for a good deal on licorice to have some on hand, and the Red Vines brand was recommended to me by a friend, so I decided to give them a try after reading the reviews on Superstore. So, with an open mind and hoping for the best, I placed my order with Superstore. The consistency of Red Vines is completely different than what I'm used to. They come out of the package with a grainy, dry finish, which is a contrast to the smooth, glossy finish of most other licorice I've had. Also, while Twizzlers and Lucky Country are somewhat thick and chewy, Red Vines are relatively thin, almost hollow. They have a lightness to them that the licorice I'm used to doesn't. They stay chewy in your mouth, but the grainy finish gives a somewhat different texture in your mouth. It's neither good nor bad... just different than what I'm accustomed to. In terms of taste, this is where I was most sorely disappointed. I don't know if it's the packaging or some other issue, but they have a chemical, almost menthol-like taste that isn't at all pleasant. The immediate aftertaste is brutal because it feels like you're breathing chemical fumes (almost like the air inside the individual vines is infused with this chemical taste/odor) but when this wears off (after about 3-5 minutes), there is a somewhat pleasing fruity licorice aftertaste that lingers. I don't know if it's a positive that there's still an aftertaste more than 5 minutes later, but it's certainly not enough to rescue them from the chemical taste. I'm now left with a 4lbs. tub of licorice, minus 4 vines, that I will likely throw out because I cannot return a food product to Superstore, and I honestly don't feel safe ingesting them. I wasn't expecting a health food or a natural or organic food product when ordering licorice, but I certainly wasn't expecting the sensation of breathing and eating something not only artificial, but chemical in nature. UPDATE - My parents came by for a visit, and they've previously had Red Vines, so I had them taste it to judge if there was something wrong with the batch I received. They found that it tasted like what they'd had previously, and did not have an issue with it. So their input confirms that there was nothing wrong with my package of Red Vines, and it seems my problem with them is purely that I find them offensive to my palate, and not any fault in the product. So I didn't have to throw them away, and my parents are enjoying them thoroughly, but I wouldn't buy them again, and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone without having tried them first. Like I said initially, it seems to be a product you either love or hate, with no middle ground. …",6 out of 15 users found this review helpful
" Warning, non-diet syrup contains Sucralose (Splenda)",3,"This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener. I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar. It does, in fact, contain real sugar. But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose. I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a ""half diet"" drink. But I don't like diet drinks. I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste. I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then. So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners. I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream. I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product. They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups. It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose. …",30 out of 38 users found this review helpful

" Great Product, Poor Customer Service",3,"Terrific all-in-one aeroponic grow unit. Seed kits are pricey, but the company has done the hard work of figuring out which varieties of plants grow well in water and which nutrients each plant type needs. Well designed, easy to maintain, fun to watch and quiet - it deserves 5 stars. Customer service, though, earns 1 star at best. Emails we sent to support went unanswered; detailed voicemails were unreturned. The only way we (sometimes) received help was to wait on their toll-free line for a CSR. The agents were courteous and tried to do whatever was necessary to remedy the problem. Unfortunately, follow through was quite discouraging. For example, (1) our address was incorrectly entered for an accessory order. We were not able to get anyone at the company to correct it in time which caused a delivery delay. (2) We were charged twice for the order. It took over 4 weeks and many phone calls to customer service before a credit was issued. Finally, (3) the shipping confirmation email was sent two weeks AFTER the order had arrived late. When we told an agent of our frustrations, they remarked about the overwhelming response they've received through Superstore. Well, with a product receiving such positive reviews, how did they not expect this sort of response? Their own literature describes the multiple years of product development. They should've spent some of that time on decent customer support. …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 Better and cheaper than 5-Hour Energy,5,"I'm not an ""energy-shot"" kind of person generally. You won't find me rappelling down mountainsides, kayaking over rapids, or hang-gliding over Death Valley. I have an office job, and my stimulant of choice is coffee or tea. BUT... There are times when I really need heightened concentration and I'm already exhausted. I can't just drink coffee indefinitely, because it makes me irritable and makes my heart race if I overindulge. That's when I use energy shots. I've been in the habit of using 5-hour Energy. But 5-hour Energy is... well, how shall I say this... yucky. I've tried every flavor, and they all taste metallic and leave an aftertaste reminiscent of boiled-down Diet Dr Pepper. Thankfully, Red Rain has the exact same effect on me as 5-hour Energy (the regular strength, not the extra strength), but tastes far better. What is the effect, you ask? For me, it's a very gentle lift. It's not so much a caffeine jolt as an improved ability to focus on creative or technically-demanding tasks. And it's a lot cheaper than 5-Hour Energy, too, even if you get your 5-Hour Energy at a warehouse store. If you're looking for a kick in the pants that helps you party all night long, I can't recommend Red Rain. If you're looking for a subtle pick-me-up that will help you get through the tasks at hand, this could be the one. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" Good rice, but...",3,"Okay, it is a good rice. Tilda Basmati is a completely fantastic rice if separate rice grains are an important thing to you. I should say that I purchased a Zojirushi NS-LAC05 rice cooker. If you want rice to make a difference, buy a really good rice cooker. Rice does not have to be a filler substance. Tilda Basmati Rice has extra-super long grains. The grains are so long that many of them curl after being prepared. This is an absolutely superb rice if a fluffy, separate grain rice is of high priority. There is a place for that and I am quite thankful for my purchase for that category of need. Tilda really is a great, high quality rice for common rice needs. Since I got my Zojirushi rice cooker, well, the cooker really brings out the differences in rice. If you just prepare your rice in a saucepan on the stove, it really doesn't matter all that much to buy an upper level quality rice IMHO. No offense to saucepan/stove-top people. Rice is a good and often necessary food item. Stove-top prep is certainly better than not having it. HOWEVER, my Zojirushi rice cooker has really made rice a whole 'nuther deal. And to my point: Tilda Basmati is a really great rice if you want fluffy rice with separate rice grains. Fluffy rice with separate grains is a totally valid category. In fact, it may be what most people want. I feel that my Tilda Basmati is a very high quality rice. My only disappointment is that it is in that extra long grain category and the fact that it produces very separate rice grains, which could be a very positive aspect to many, if not most. I just happen to like rice that sticks together more. I would buy it again in a heartbeat next time I need long grain rice that has very separate grains. Since I purchased a 10-Pound bag, I may not need to buy more for a while. Very highly recommended if you want fluffy rice with separate grains. Not much good for sushi rice. …",4 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 Not as good as I had hoped,3,"I have ordered Kitchens of India products before (butter chicken and the rajma masala kidney bean curry) and have been pleased. Due to the good reviews for this product and my previous experiences with KoI, I didn't hesitate to purchase this. However, it's not really what I had expected. It's not as good as the butter chicken paste is, nor does it smell as good. This chicken curry paste is also VERY salty; I had to add more rice and vegetables to my bowl because I couldn't handle the salt. The flavor is strong, though not spicy, and I think that the butter chicken is much more balanced in terms of spices and flavor and I wish that I had purchased that instead. Still, this is easy and quick to prepare and while it doesn't taste great it's still decent, which warrants its 3 stars. …",33 out of 34 users found this review helpful

" Dark and Rich, but Drink a Small Cup",4,"There's a little place on Magazine Street in New Orleans that serves real Italian hot chocolate -- yum! it's thick, dark and just sweet enough to satisfy and replicate the European hot chocolate experience. Happily, California company ""In Tempe Ran Tia"" makes this treat readily available. Creating a reasonable facsimile with a medium price point, this mix boasts of intense dark chocolate flavor that is easy to prepare and even easier to drink. ' Caveat: The only problem I had was I drank way too much -- a large 'Venti' sized cup that did not work well with my system the next day. ""In Tempe Ran Tia"" recommends a small 4 ounce cup which is about the size of a service in Europe. So do comply with their recommended dosage. I had a bit of trouble finding the instructions for this mix - its hidden--printed in the box lid. Follow carefully -- the mix contains arrowroot which allows the mixture to thicken after it has been properly blended. For those who do not like sugar, this mix is sugar free--so sweetness can be adjusted to taste. The packaging is attractive --lovely violet ribbon and silk miniature sunflower adorns an orange/yellow reptile print box. Nice! Bottom line?

This faintly green powder is mixed with water to make a thick paste to get wasabi, used for sushi, sashimi and to flavor tuna and other dishes. <p>One trick is to mix the wasabi in a rice bowl or tea bowl and turn the bowl upside-down. Yes, that's what I said, turn it over. The paste will stick in the bowl, and the developing sulfurous gases that make wasabi hot, hot, hot are retained, improving the bite. Get that wasabi buzz. <p>I like to use it in tuna with wasabi-potato crust. Or being short on time, I just grill some yellowtail and mix a wasabi-sugar-soy sauce glaze and brush it on at the end of the grilling. Hot and sweet.

 Get these if need a POWERFUL LAXATIVE,1,"I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch. They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects. Within about 7 hours after eating these my stomach started feeling awkward. Shortly after I started having cramps and severe watery diarrhea several times throughout the evening and late night. Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum. The package I purchased said cellulose gum on the ingredients list, but on the web sites it is listed as carboxymethylcellulose. You will find they are synonyms if you Google them. All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping. If you look up this ingredient, or look it up along with ""side effects"" you will find it is undigestible and can cause side effects such as bloating and diarrhea. Never again. All I can say is please post a review if this happened to you to others are forewarned! …",15 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 Doesn't get much better,5,"Long time Oatmeal eater here. I usually bought McCann's in the store, but it can get pretty pricey. Superstore is a great deal, and you get free shipping. FYI, medium- to long-term is it unhealthy to consume steel-cut oatmeal UNLESS you soak it in warm water with something acidic between 12 to 24 hours, preferably some fermented milk product like yogurt, kefir, buttermilk, etc. Reason being is that oatmeal contains in its hull enzyme inhibitors that have a chelating effect on your body, i.e., they remove metal from your body. While short-term this may be beneficial (meat eaters stockpile extra iron, copper, etc. over time), medium-term this could lead to deficiencies in essential metals. Soaking the oatmeal at least overnight neutralizes the enzyme inhibitors. Additionally, it allows you to cook up the oatmeal in about five minutes, versus over 30 minutes when left unsoaked. This recipe follows the recipe in Nourishing Traditions, but basically soak one part oatmeal with one part lukewarm water. Add a little bit of yogurt to create the acidic environment: I use one TBSP per 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1/2 cup of warm water. Oatmeal should be eaten with some fat (many of the vitamins are fat soluble), so I add butter or cream. I also add shredded flax and coconut, increasing the healthiness of my breakfast. I then top it off with plenty of raw honey (also from Superstore), which sweetens my porridge and thus makes me look forward to breakfast in the morning. Enjoy! …",27 out of 32 users found this review helpful

 not straightforward about allergen information,1,"My daughter is extremely sensitive to gluten so many products that promote themselves as gluten free prove to be otherwise when my daughter has a gluten reaction. For the sake of keeping my daughter healthy I contact companies asking them if they test for gluten and if gluten is processed in the same facility. If it is then it is almost certainly contaminated. Most companies give me a detailed and open answer so that I can make the best decision for my daughter. They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not. They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision. Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer. They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing. They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels. They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so. So Larabar is attempting to deceive me. They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars. Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful. I was so turned off by Larabar's response that I want nothing to do with them. It was obvious they could care less about my daughter's health.

 living up to expectations,5,"I am a type 2 diabetic and it is under excellent control. Nevertheless, I'm always looking for ways to give me a hand with it. I read that Ceylon cinnamon was the 'real' thing so I purchased a pound of it last summer and have been using it. I did not change anything else in my diet. Two weeks ago I had my six-month check-up and my 3-month levels were WAY down. We were all quite surprised and although I do get outside and do more work in the summer, which might help a bit, it has not helped to that degree in years past. I'm thinking it was the cinnamon, which I use quite a bit in cooking and in the breads I make (I make all our own). Yes, it's got a great taste, but I'm afraid I'm not much of a gourmet when it comes to cinnamon -- I like it in whatever form it comes in!

 Worst company ever!!!!,1,I ordered Chocolate from Italy. Maybe this was the first mistake since it is Texas in the Summer.

When I opened the box of course the chocolate was soup and the remains of a soggy single ice pack. What does this say about this company? They ship from Italy with one tiny ice pack; not even dry ice. Also they said it was my fault that I was not home when Fed ex tried to deliver the package. So I am out $75 and nothing to show for it.

 ARTIFICIAL TASTING STUFF,1,"I read another review of this product that stated that this product's first and main ingredient is whey. Whey is a by-product of milk (remember that little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey). Whey has a somewhat acidic taste that is rather crude. Cheddar cheese is way down the line in terms of percentage quantity in this stuff. I couldn't think of what this stuff tasted like until I read the other review. It's taste does not resemble that of cheddar cheese. I knew the product had an odd taste which I did not care for. I just didn't realize what that taste was until I came across the other review. There are no ingredients listed on the label. Now I understand why most liked the product. I assume because they are used to the taste of boxed macaroni and cheese products available in the grocery store with the orange/yellow powder in the packet inside the box. And most have come to think of that taste as cheese. Finer tastes however will reject this stuff, I think because it has little cheese. Cheddar cheese is made with the by products of milk as well. The big difference is the cultures that are added to produce the various types of cheese. Plus the aging. Whey requires no aging or cultures. Another of the characteristics of whey is that it has little orange/yellow color. This stuff has food colorings added to produce the appearance you see in the bag. I read another review where the writer complained about the lack of labeling. I agree because it is important to most to know what they are consuming. If you look at the ingredients of some of the other cheese powders you will see cheddar as the first ingredient unlike this stuff. I believe the reason that this product has no ingredient labeling is to hide that fact. By regulation ingredients are to be listed in the order of the percentage contained therein. In other words the first ingredient would be the highest percentage and therefore the last ingredient would be the lowest quantity contained. I'm not sure what the percentage of cheddar cheese is in this stuff but its way down the line and not the first. I have tasted other cheese powders with ingredient lists. Some of best are those with cheese as the first listed ingredient not the 3rd or 4th. I really don't like the taste of whey powder. It is crude and acidic. And that is to me what this stuff tastes like. I doubt whether I'll buy any more of this. To each his own taste, though. I don't purport to know what anyone else prefers. …",14 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Great Taste,5,"I think the negative reviews are a little harsh. This company is not alone in labeling their almonds raw even though they are most likely pasteurized. Is it right. I agree no, but when it comes to almond butter no matter what your choices are going to be either organic or not. So at least you know they are being grown healthier than the alternative. ALL almonds in the United States are pasteurized. You can go to health food/ co-oop store and most likely find imported raw almonds ( my store has some from Italy), but if you go to Whole Foods they are also going to try and sell you ""raw"" almonds that are not truly raw. Everyone seems to be in on the mislabeling. Anyway...google it and get educated if your interested. If you are looking for a great tasting organic almond butter at decent price you won't be disappointed with this one.

 Roach Magnet,5,"We were having a problem in our garage with Oriental Roaches (aka ""waterbugs"") these are the big black roaches usually found outdoors in yards near water sources. They were coming in under the garage door this summer to escape the heat and search for water. These traps were excellent for attracting and traping these roaches. In fact, I was replacing them every couple of days because they were full of roaches and also spiders and other insects. Just be aware that traps of any kind are helpful in lowering a roach population, but they will not eliminate them. Traps are also very useful in gauging how big of a problem you have. To rid yourself of the Oriental roach or other species of roaches, you will need Advion Cockroach Gel Bait by Dupont. This is a relatively low toxcicity bait that will wipe out a roach infestation. It can be purchased from a number of DIY pest control websites and is the same stuff used by the professionals. Also very important in roach control is the following list of things you need to do in addition to the bait mentioned above: ***Don't let them in. Cockroaches may enter houses via sewer connections, under doors, around utility pipes, air ducts, or other openings in the foundation. They love cracks and can squeeze in just about anywhere. Young roaches can fit into a space as thin as a dime. An adult male needs a crack about the thickness of a quarter. Attach well-fitting door sweeps. Fill holes where pipes disappear into walls with silicon sealant, steel/bronze wool. Search for cracks along foundations, baseboards, pipes, windows, vents, cabinets and doors and seal larger gaps and dust smaller cracks with Boric Acid. Install or repair window and door screens. Install fine mesh screens over vents, ducts and floor drains. Keep sink plugs over drains in sinks, showers, etc., which are not used often. ***Keep them away from food. A roach can find a snack just about anywhere. They eat crumbs, pet food, dead leaves and trash. Store food in tightly sealed containers or in the refrigerator and put pet food away overnight. Don't leave open bags of food or candy lying around. Clean up spills and crumbs right away, especially from under appliances, and wipe all counters and tables after use. Rinse food and drink containers before disposal, empty trash and recycling frequently, and use trashcans with tight-fitting lids. Clean your dirty dishes right away and keep the stove grease and food free. Wash or replace sponges and dishrags often. ***Keep them thirsty. Roaches need water to live. Without it, they die within a week even though they can live up to a month without food. Fix dripping faucets. Water yards in the early morning, not at night when roaches are active. Don't over water yards. Prevent condensation from your A/C unit from pooling near your foundation. ***Make it hard for them to hide. Roaches spend most of their lives hiding. If roaches can't hide, they'll find someplace else to live. Move woodpiles, stockpiled bricks and other clutter away from outside walls. Raise boxes and stored items off your garage floors and away from walls. Take your recycling out promptly; avoid letting old food cans, stacks of newspapers or magazines pile up. Use a light dusting of Boric Acid under appliances, under sinks, cupboards and other low lying areaas where roaches like to hide. …",115 out of 118 users found this review helpful
 Great Product,5,"I purchased after reading many reviews. Use on face, chest and hands. The first application was not dramatic as far as results go; but I use daily and the results are fantastic. It took me about a week to get the impressive results. I have very dry skin. My serums and creams were not penetrating into my skin to give me a hydrated look. Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating. My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking. I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes. Remove in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture. The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it. This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant! My hands were looking rough. My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help. I use this on my hands every night, remove with a microdermabrasion product then apply a thick lotion. Finally my hands look very nice. I have stocked up on this product, I never want to run out.

" Hunger Satisfaction, YES! Great Taste, YES!",5,"Finally! A hunger satisfaction product that actually works and tastes great, too. One of my main problems when I am on a diet is that I am constantly hungry. I've tried so many other products that claim to reduce hunger, yet I don't notice any real effects. However, this Crystal Light product does reduce my hunger pangs and enables me to go longer between meals. The instructions indicate the powder should be mixed with a 16.9 ounce bottle of water, but I find the flavor a bit strong, so I usually mix it with a 20 ounce bottle. The strawberry-banana flavor is very fruity and I can't discern any chemical or artificial aftertaste. I take this with me on trips, it's great for avoiding the temptations of airport fast food. I also mix it into liquid diet meals for a boost of fiber. It doesn't blend particularly well with anything other than water, so I use a blender for this. Even with water, you have to shake the bottle vigorously, but it does blend well with vigorous shaking. All in all, this has really helped me to be more successful on my diet. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" Not the same ""Delfa Rolls"" I remember",1,"I was very excited that 7 years later, they decide to bring ""Delfa Rolls"" or ""Danish Ribbons"" back. Seeing these reminded me of my childhood, so I bought a case. It took WAY too long to receive the package. It came a day after the latest estimation date. I busted into the box so fast. Ripped the packaging and dug right in. As soon at it hit my mouth I knew. These are NOT the same as they once were. They taste fine, but they are not the same. I think licorice laces you get at CVS or RiteAid for $0.99 are closer to the taste of ""Delfa Rolls"" than these are. I'm very very disappointed! …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
" Delicious Treat--Hey, It's Not a Diet Food!",5,"There's little question that these cookies have the crumbly pastry-like taste associated with European biscuits in general, they're flaky good like a buttery crust, although not quite as rich and moist as Vienna's finest. The insides is moister; howver, replete with creamy soft chocolate flvor, almost pudding-like in consistency. However, your Honor, since there's a nutritional debate among these reviews, I'd like to enter into evidence the incontrovertible the facts right off this 5.3 ounce package OF ""HITs"" that I hold in my hand. Exhibit A. The following shows the amount and percent of the recommended daily allowance (rda) of one serving - that's two HIT cookies, or 27 grams--based on a 2,000 calorie/day diet.In one serving (two cookies (27 grams): Calories per serving: 140, total fat =7 grams (11%), Saturated fat=6 grams (29%), Cholesterol, 0 grams; sodium, 75 mg (3%); and 17 grams (6%) of carbohydrates, including 1 gram (3%) of dietary fiber and 9 grams of sugar--and two grams of protein. You also get 2% of the RDA of Calcium, and 4% of iron. Exhibit B: Compare this to ""one serving"" or two (28 grams) cookies of wheat-free/dairy free, mostly organic Newman O's (a somewhat healthier version of the classic OREO): Total fat (4.5 grams), Saturated fat (1.5 g). Trans fat (0 g), calories (130), sugar (10.0 grams), Total Carbohydrates, (31.5g), dietary fiber (1 g), protein (2 g), sodium (85 mg), no cholesterol, iron (8%). Nutritional conclusion (As always, consult your physician!): Newman's beats the pants off HIT in total fat, saturated fat (HIT has 4 times as much), twice as much of the RDA of iron but has over twice as many carbohydrates, and minimally more sugar and sodium. Style points: I can see Audrey Hepburn eating a HIT bar (without the bright wrapper) or something like it, served on a silver platter, with Italian coffee or perhaps some tea. I cannot see her, unless she's slumming it in ""Roman Holiday"" eating an Oreo, even one owned by an actor as great as Paul Newman. HIT cookies--loved by kids, suitable for the adult. Offered here at a great price; moveover, Superstore ships this free on eligible orders of $25 or more. …",14 out of 17 users found this review helpful

Chicken broth is a grocery item that I use in many recipes but small (8oz) portions are not available at any of the local grocery stores in my hometown. I ordered this because of the convenience of being able to open only what I need but I will continue to purchase not only because of size but taste.

 The ONLY Soy Sauce Alternative our Picky Eater will EAT!,5,"Our daughter was diagnosed with allergies to Gluten, Casein & Soy when she was 18 months old. Unfortunately, one of her favorite food treats was rice with soy sauce. We tried making all kinds of alternative soy sauces using recipes we found online that met her allergy restrictions and nothing appealed to her taste buds. Finally, one day we accidentally found Coconut Aminos!! This has been a lifesaver! We love the product, and unlike another reviewer, we DO use it for fried rice...we just add fish sauce to offset the sweetness. We don't have any other option for soy sauce, and it works great! The only thing we do NOT like about this product is that it has a bit of an effervescent quality to it...MANY bottles that we have purchased have burst and leaked. Also, it is a mess to pour. I asked the company if it would harm the product at all to put it in a soy sauce type dispenser bottle and they ""didn't think so."" LOL We tried it and have not noticed a quality difference, so that is how we use it now...from a spouted dispenser.

 Dee-lish!,5,"Lentils would win the Miss Congeniality title in any legume pageant. Even the lowly brown grocery store variety is tasty in soups, salads and on their own, but Lentils du Puy are the Holy Grail of lentils, grown in rocky French soil and very expensive in the US. Bob's Red Mill French Green Lentils are the closest things to Lentils du Puy we can get. Even these are not cheap, but SO worth the price! How fortunate are we that Bob's Red Mill has these tiny green jewels available. Described on the package as 'exquisite', this is not hyperbole. They are beautiful to look at and to eat. The flavor is more sharply defined and 'beanier' than the brown kind, and makes a superb soup. Simply saute some chopped up carrots, onions and garlic in some olive oil, add a cup of these green lentils in three cups of water or stock, a cup of dry wine, and a can of stewed tomatoes with juice, a healthy pinch of Herbes de Provence or Italian Seasoning, a couple of bay leaves and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes to an hour. Meat eaters can add some ham cubes, cut up cooked Italian sausages or smoked turkey cubes, but it's wonderful meat free and even better the next day. For an elegant soup, use a stick blender to puree, and add a little cream or lemon, but none of these is necessary. A sprinkling of Parmesan cheese to serve is the perfect touch. I'm thrilled with these lentils and they've become a staple in my kitchen. They do take a little longer to cook than the package directs, and do not expect them to become mushy. No matter how done they are, they will retain their shape along with a lovely chewiness. Main dish, soup, side dish or salad, you can't go wrong. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 such great treats!,5,"I give these to my dog to help with her minor tartar problems. She LOVES them and they definitely do the job. One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up. …",23 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Tastes homemade,5,"I've made many waffle recipes from scratch, and I've tried a bunch of mixes. This is the only mix that literally tastes home-made, to the point that I basically don't make homemade waffles anymore. It's totally simple to make (just mix + water + egg + oil). Unfortunately it's hard to find in grocery stores, so it's great to see it on Superstore. Cooking tip: undercook it a little to keep the waffle light & fluffy. When the waffle gets crispy it's not quite as good (but still very good). I have also tried Krusteaz pancake mix, which is easier to find in stores.

 Greatest stuff on the planet,5,"This is the greatest stuff on the planet. First off, I think it's the best silken tofu there is--firm silken will do all of your silken needs, basically. I use it to make mousses for desserts in my food processor. For instance, add some melted chocolate chips, some corn starch, add to a graham cracker crust: you've got a pie. Or I will add some peanut butter, cocoa powder and maple syrup to make a mousse. I also like to just add strawberries and bananas and maple syrup for a ""yogurt."" I use it to make ""sour cream"" and onion dips for vegetables. I also like it to make ""sour cream"" for Mexican food and potatoes--my omni boyfriend can't even tell the difference. Also good to make mayonnaise for potato salad. I recommend a food processor or blender to really get the smooth, creamy texture. This tofu is the best stuff on the planet. I order the 12 pack of it, because I got through 4 or more a week. Also, I like to get the organic, because soybeans are typically highly sprayed crops. It's worth the few extra bucks. I love this stuff--behind my almond milk, this is my most vital ingredient. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Gastrointestinal Armageddon,1,"When I got these, I couldn't contain my excitement and I ate about a quarter of a bag. Scenes from the movie 2012 could have been filmed inside my gut. There would have been less pressure to make two winning free throws in the NBA finals than for gas to escape my bowels. After a few hours, I had an EXTREME build-up of gas with no relief. All I could do was lie on my bed and pray for a fart. That might sound funny, but when you've eaten something that has basically turned you into the blueberry girl from **** Wonka, you're pleading for relief. Well, the farts came and I lived through it but I not only had a visit from the fart fairy, but the sales rep from Montezuma's Revenge stopped by and gave me a FULL demo of their services as well. In retrospect, eating over a pound all at once wasn't the brightest thing I've done (but it also wasn't the dimmest).

 Packing problems solved; product great as always,5,"I was alarmed when I suddenly became unable to find this product in any local grocery store. I visited Superstore and was relieved to find it available here, but was troubled by the multiple reviews complaining that the packaging was poor and that the jars arrived broken. So I wrote to Superstore Customer Service to inquire about the situation. I received a prompt, courteous reply saying that the packaging problem had been corrected and that I could order with confidence. So I did. The six jars arrived the other day, IMPECCABLY packaged--each jar individually wrapped in bubble wrap, the six jars carefully packed in a box with additional cushioning, that box packed in a second box with cushioning. All six jars were in perfect condition. As for the product, I have relied on Nestea Unsweetened 100% Instant for years. It is the only instant iced tea I have ever been able to find that is absolutely pure, without any sweeteners, flavorings, or additives. That may not be everyone's cup of tea (so to speak), but if you like your iced tea straight, or if you prefer to add your own sweetener or lemon, this is the product to buy.

 My Dog Thinks This Is Her Treat For the Day!,5,"When my vet told me my little Yorkie had stage IV luxating patellas (knees blown out), I was devastated. The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the ""chicken flavor"" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog. On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online. They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition. This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos. As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended ""Golden Aloe"" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well.

 Do you like baby formula and stale cardboard? Well have I got a drink for you!,1,"Wow - this is easily the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. I am a huge fan of soy products - I drink Silk, I eat vegan cheese of all flavors, I love soy yogurt - I've even dined on tofu dogs. I'm not a vegan (or even a vegetarian), I have an allergy to milk. For the most part I have been able to find all kinds of great substitutes for milk and dairy products. Because of all the great reviews I decided to give this a shot. First of all, let me just say that the amount of money you are supposedly saving is at best a stretch of the truth, and at most a blazing lie. I live in a relatively small area (where grocery prices are normally really jacked up) and I can find Silk and many other brands of soy, rice and almond milks for this price or less. So you probably are not saving as much as they claim. Now, on to the taste. It's not just that it's bad, it's that it's SO BAD my stomach is still turning. I'm not sure why other reviewers are giving it a good rating... maybe they're of the mindset that if you buy something vegan it has to be gross, which may have been true 30 years ago, but simply isn't the case today. I've had all kinds of dairy free foods that were fantastic - milks, breads, yogurts, ice creams, puddings, sauces, creams, etc. and they all tasted great. There is no excuse for the taste of this. I'm not joking or exaggerating at all when I say it tastes like old baby formula and stale cardboard. And I know it's not just me - I tried this stuff on three other people. Two of them got as far as smelling it and then refused to taste it (good move since it tastes worse than it smells) and one of them braved up and took a drink... and then pulled a face and wiped his tongue on his shirt. My mother suggested that I try to cover up the cardboard taste... couldn't be done. Then she suggested I try it in baking... but there is no way I'm putting THAT taste into cookies or cake. And please don't misunderstand and think that maybe I just don't like the taste of natural soy because I assure you that I do - I love roasted soy nuts, they're great. That is NOT the taste I am describing here, this is something else. Seriously, old baby formula and stale cardboard... …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
