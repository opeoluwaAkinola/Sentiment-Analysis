 NOT GLUTEN-FREE,1,"I am gluten sensitive -- I get migraines from wheat. I am able to take some wheat grass products but not others. On the Amazing Grass website, they swear it's gluten-free.

 Didn't like the taste; High protein/grain free = issues,1,"My family recently adopted a 15 lb. Chihuahua mix who was found abandoned... we didn't know what she had eaten beforehand, but I'm guessing it wasn't anything high-quality due to the condition of her teeth and coat. My goal was to get her on a high-quality diet (a ""6/6"" rating), and researched high protein/grain free diets and the benefits of them. Additionally, I read up on Innova/Evo and understood that their products are extremely high quality, and someone else on a forum recommended we try the Red Meat Small Bite kibble with her. Even at first sniff, my dog indicated she didn't like it. Of course, I figure it would take some time, so I worked on transitioning her off of the other kibble she was on. It basically came down to the fact that she would only eat the Innova Evo when it was mixed in with some wet food, and oftentimes only with a bit of cottage cheese mixed in. Shortly after being on this high-protein diet (we didn't even finish her small bag of food), she began to urinate around the house, which she hasn't done in the 5 months we've had her. It turns out she had urinary crystals, which the vet attributed to the high protein levels of her diet. We had to put her on Flagil, and the vet recommended I put her on Hill's Science Diet c/d (which I know is full of corn and grain fillers). After politely declining, I changed her diet to something more holistic that DOES have grain (a ""4/6"" rating). She's fine now... Innova/Evo is an extremely high quality brand... perhaps it's better for larger and very active dogs. I know not ALL dogs may have this reaction to a high-protein diet, but I really think people need to understand that high-protein/no grain isn't always the smartest choice in terms of your dog's health. In our case, it turned out to be much more costly for us and more stressful for our dog to make this switch. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 BEWARE:  MADE IN CHINA,1,"I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so ""addictive."" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is ""decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods."" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats. Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes? Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky? I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring. Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure. See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China. Be informed! [...] …",80 out of 83 users found this review helpful
 Planned Obsolescence!,1,"Initial set up of the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz is easy, just unscrew the cap and remove the liner. It has a surprisingly rich set of standalone and integrated food possibilities and the addition of vitamin D was a bonus. However, I find that this product quickly becomes unstable (even without overclocking) to the point that it is no longer usable. At first I tried passive cooling to prevent the degradation, but ultimately had to switch to an active cooling method to prolong the products usefulness. Note that even with this extreme care the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz will still break down. Even if you never use the product it will still fail! This is the worst kind of planned obsolescence, requiring you to replace this product every two weeks whether you use it or not! Pros: Inexpensive, easy set up. Cons: Short product lifecycle. No instruction manual. No optical/coax sound output. …",346 out of 356 users found this review helpful
 Not as advertised,1,"Let's start this with Superstore took care of the issue with this product promptly and courteously so FIVE STARS for them. Now the abysmal packaging and quantity/quality of this product. Run, stay away, don't think about it, just keep moving along. Not in a holiday box but in a brown box with a 11""x14"" piece of colored paper that can be taped to the front to cover the cellophane. And no little view hole either like the picture. The brown box it comes in is about 5"" deep but the interior brown box of contents is supported by 3"" of cardboard underneath. The 2"" deep contents box has 1"" of scrap paper pressing the contents into the cellophane. So what is in that 1""x11""x14""? Not much! 1 packet of hot chocolate for a 6 oz cup? That's like a shot. The littlest 3-4 packages of other stuff not worth mentioning but think 1/3 the size of a small kids lunch bag of chips. The mustard is in a jar smaller than what the airlines serve jelly in. (1 Oz). The cheese wheel is more cardboard and little cheese. The knife to cut the cheese came out of some playdooh set. Let's just say this isn't worth $5 and due to the packaging, it can't be gifted without shame. …",117 out of 119 users found this review helpful
 Too runny,2,While the texture was fine with the macaroni the consistency was way too runny. The cheese sauce wasn't thick at all which made it messy for the kids to eat.

 Fantastic.,5,"Exactly how I always pictured Bertie Bott's beans would be. I have the generation before these and they've been spot on since movie 1 (GOD, the HORSERADISH flavor was AWFUL. UGH.). The generation before these has a single flavor that literally made me retch. The fish flavored jelly beans are SO AWFUL that you will gag. You will. Trust me. These, on the other hand, only have a few really awful ones. Avoid vomit if you can, because that's probably what you'll be doing next. whoever makes these is awesome. …",44 out of 46 users found this review helpful
 Free lunch is over ...,5,"I usually do not write reviews on Superstore (or anywhere else for that matter), but I really have to make an exception in this case because of how well this device works. It is rare for any device to work exactly as expected, but the Victor Blackbox Gopher Trap works above and beyond any expectations that I had for it. I do not work for the Victor company, and I have no financial stake in the sales of their products. I am simply an exasperated homeowner who got fed up wih gophers tearing up his property and decided to give this device a try. I had used poison pellets, smoke bombs, water hose, and those silly sonic devices... nothing worked and those gophers were probably laughing at me. With the Blackbox, it's nearly a sure thing. Also, you actually get to see the results with a dead gopher right in front of you, unlike smoke bombs and poison which are always a guessing game as to whether or not they actually did their job. Within 2 day of getting this product, I had already caught 3 gophers. One of those gophers was caught less than 1 hour after I set the trap. Free lunch on my property is now officially over. The key to the effectiveness of this trap is to find a freshly dug up gopher mound. My sure kill method: 1) Find a freshly dug up gopher mound. 2) Dig out the mound until you find the tunnel. 3) Place the activated trap flush with the entrance of the tunnel, with the small round hole (on one side of the trap) facing outward. 4) Cover up the gaps at the top, sides and bottom of the trap with dirt so that it looks like the tunnel extends into the Blackbox, but make sure the opening to the trap is unobstructed from inside their tunnel. The idea is to make the trap seem like an extension of the gopher's tunnel, and by instinct the gopher will head towards that small open hole on the other side of the trap to plug it up (they don't like any openings into their tunnels). Once he enters the trap, it's goodnight Gracie. This trap is so strong that the gopher will be nearly snapped in half. Before getting the Blackbox, I had also tried using a ""Macabee"" gopher trap (the one with the 2 pincers that snap together) but the gopher simply pushed that trap out of his tunnel. The Macabee is also a lot more risky to use and harder to set (in terms of triggering it accidentally on your hand). The Blackbox is safer to use and much easier to set because the trigger mechanism and the killing device is contained fully within the box itself. The Macabee trap can also be dragged away by a dying gopher if it is not properly secured. There is definitely no chance of a gopher dragging away a Blackbox. In summary, I wish I had used the Blackbox from the beginning. It would have saved me a lot of time, money, frustration and parts of my yard. UPDATE Aug-17-2011: I have just posted some pics as proof of the effectiveness of this device. After 13 captures within the first 4 months of use, I have not seen any more gopher activity since April 2011. I guess word got out in the gopher community that there is now a steep price of admission onto this property. …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Contains a form of MSG!,1,"My son enjoyed eating these bunnies until I realize that they contained ""Yeast Extract"", which contains free glutamic acid...another term for, or type of MSG! I checked the back of the box because I had begun reading a book called, ""Excitotoxins"" (great book for moms by the way), which lists the many forms of MSG and explains what they do to the body. It is associated with reproductive disorders, damage to the brain, damage to the endocrine system, obesity and other disorders. Companies use such additives to food to make them taste better and make them more addictive. Yeast Extract is harmful to everyone, but particularly little children. I was especially upset that this additive showed up in an ""organic product"" and one for children! Many of the other companies out there that produce organic products do not use such additives. Here's an article about Yeast Extract: [...] Here's another site with a listing of all the different forms of MSG: [...] …",22 out of 32 users found this review helpful
 Best Tasting Salt AND So Incredibly Good For You,5,"This is the best tasting salt I've ever had. I learned about this after starting a ""raw"" diet and I was obsessed about having everything raw. I'm a condiment queen and it was really hard for me to give up a lot of my condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo). I was never a salt user - I'm a self-described fresh pepper addict and connoisseur. However, once I realized this salt was raw, all natural and got great reviews, I decided to try it. This really does enhance almost every dish I eat. In addition, there are a ton of articles online explaining why this 200 million year old natural nutrient is so very good for us. Move over table salt with your history of ridicule and side effects; move in Himalayan salt. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful
" Didn't work for me, but worth a try. Order it from Superstore.",1,"The first time I posted my experience, six readers immediately disagreed with it (obviously they felt they knew far better than I whether FRS Healthy Energy provided me with any ""lift""). I withdrew the review, but upon reflection I've regretted my decision to do so. Whether or not the product ""worked"" for an individual is necessarily personal and anecdotal, one person's report. It's hardly a matter for disagreement--unless the responder is intent upon promoting an agenda. All of the FRS products have ingredients likely to be familiar to users of ""energy"" drinks, powders, supplements, and bites: sugar, corn syrup, fructose, caffeine, green tea extract. The drink also offers the MDR for key vitamins along with antioxidant activity from the green tea leaves and, most importantly, ""quercetin,"" a bioflavanoid that is used in red wine replacement capsules as a highly potent free radical scavenger. While ""quercetin"" is widely recognized as an effective blood toner, conditioner, and ""bad"" cholesterol reducer, FRS is prominently promoting it as an energizer, capable of ""extending"" the body's natural adrenaline ""and"" removing the ""oxidants that cause fatigue."" A controversial statement, backed by little controlled studies, especially if the inference is that quercetin will provide an immediate ""lift."" Of course, FRS points out that it's not simply the individual ingredients that provide increased energy but an optimal, catalytic combination that promotes thermogenesis, increases metabolic rate, and helps the body make efficient use of carbohydrates. So it's possible the product has worked for many (besides Mr. Armstrong). If so, testimonials on its behalf deserve to be taken seriously by any curious, health-minded individuals. The powdered drink mix perhaps makes the most sense to start with, and the chewy bites the least (the sugar in the bites actually had a paradoxical effect, momentarily enervating rather than energizing me). The drink is flavorable enough, with a convincing fresh-fruitish ""tang,"" and not overly sweet. But in my case it did not counteract either the late-morning or late-afternoon ""crashes"" and obviate the need for that extra expresso or two. If you choose to try the product, be exceptionally careful about the apparently generous internet offer, endorsed by Mr. Armstrong, of a complete sample kit of the products sent free of charge (with the exception of postage and handling costs). The merchandising tactics of FRS are practically antithetical to the full-disclosure, consumer-centric policies of a site like Superstore. (If Bezos offered everyone a free Kindle, saying it's yours to keep if you don't like it, I'd have full confidence in his offer; FRS employs more deceptive, misleading tactics that could result in your admittance to a pricey club before you even realized you were a member.) So put Lance Armstrong and his company (he's part owner) to the test, but order the products through Superstore to avoid unwanted hassle, hustle and hype. If you decide the product is for you, then is the time to inquire into the benefits of being a member of the club. …",144 out of 154 users found this review helpful
" Say it once, say it twice, third time's the charm!",5,"When this movie first came out about fifteen years ago, my father owned a video store and every Wednesday night was ""Beetlejuice"" night. I'm older now, obviously, but I still cannot get enough of this movie. <p>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play Adam and Barbara Maitland, two Connecticut yuppies who die prematurely in a car wreck. Within a couple weeks, their home is overrun by an ultra-trendy New York City family, Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter, Lydia (played respectively by Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder). Adam and Barbara want their house back, and attempt to scare the Deetz's out of the house by wearing sheets and even by possessing them over dinner, making them sing and dance to Harry Belafonte's ""Day O."" Those attempts fail and enter Michael Keaton as Betelguese, ""the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist."" The movie is dark without being scary and funny without being ridiculous. <p>In my opinion, one of the real gems in this film is the late Sylvia Sidney as Juno, Your Case Worker. Sidney was pushing eighty when this film was made, but turns in a great performance as the embittered equivalent of an afterlife social worker. Love how the smoke from her ever-present cigarette comes out of the slit in her throat. <p>If you've never seen this movie, see it. If you have seen it but don't own it on DVD, get it. The picture quality is better than ever. …",66 out of 67 users found this review helpful
 The flavours are not lies!,5,"These beans are a wonderful thing. The good flavors, you can eat, and they are totally fantastic. The terrible flavors, you can belittle the manhood of your friends with. The in-between flavors? Like grass? They're largely there to confuse you, and do so wonderfully. To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote: Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. ""Okay,"" I begin ""but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth."" My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt! Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. ""Alright,"" they said ""This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow."" Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth. It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg! Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful. The rotten egg, dirt, soap, and vomit beans all taste exactly what they are supposed to. And that is what makes them a fantastic product. …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 Not as good as it could be (misleading ingredient label also),1,"A number of us earnestly tried this product but after trying another brand, found this to be wanting very much.

Most importantly, this company tasty eats does not have any garlic or onion powder in any of their products. This was the biggest, we felt, downfall of this product. Except this company, every jerky company; except tasty eats which uses no garlic or onion powder in any of their product line, all would list garlic or onion if an ingredient. The primal strips company has ""vegetarian spices"" so one is not clear what this is. Even the company, after phoning them, are rather reticent about saying if their is granulated garlic or onion.

 get some today and ignore the diet debacle for a while (three and one-half stars),4,"Kellogg's Frosted Rice Krispies Cereal is absolutely scrumptious! Sure, it's all in the sugar (smile); but once in a while you can give yourself a treat. It may be a better alternative to nothing for antsy kids who really didn't want any breakfast before school. As long as you eat these before the expiration date stamped on the box they will be delicious! The cereal is indeed fat and cholesterol free. That's great. The cereal contains no trans-fats--that's even better! There are 27 grams of carbs in each serving; so please be careful of that although on the other hand it's only about 9% of your daily limit for carbs as suggested by the government. Each serving of this cereal also has 25% of your recommended daily intake of Iron, Niacin, and Vitamins B12 and B6.

 Great Sweetener but learn about the product,5,"I wanted to share that my own experience with finding xylitol was nothing short of a miracle. I can enjoy food in moderation that I was denying myself.

What I do is mix this with stevia drops and I can then use that concentration for coffee and tea all day without ill effects. I feel I need to address some reviews that people have on xylitol, not necessarily from Now foods specifically. I am concerned about people buying a new product without checking what it is and then giving it bad reviews for effects written clearly on the bag. It would be different if the manufacturer was being deceptive but honestly, don't feed your kids something if you don't know what it is and then want it taken off the market. For some people this is a miracle food. Research any food you are going to put into your body or even bring into your home. It is not a manufacturers job or governments job to tell you what to eat.

" Pleasant beverage, convenient format!",4,"This product converted me, I kid you not. Before: I did not think I liked instant coffee. Now: I think I do! :-) I've tried Coffee type products, which are powdered drink mixes and not truly instant coffee, and I was never very impressed. Eventually, I learned (and you'll laugh at me for not knowing this) that instant coffee is not a ""mix"" like hot chocolate but actually coffee beans treated differently in their production from coffee beans intended to be brewed. The bean is roasted as usual, then crushed (rather than cut as for brewing beans) in preparation for creating a coffee ""concentrate"" that will then be either freeze dried or spray dried. This product (as explained on the Nescafe website) is Robusta and Arabica beans, freeze dried, a method which may or may not be the top choice for connoisseurs of instant coffee, but being new to instant coffee I don't yet appreciate the difference. I do know that the product in these single-serving sticks is the same product that was sold in canisters, before. This is just a new format for their current product, not a new product. And wow, for the sheer pleasure and convenience, it's a decent cup of coffee! It can't be mistaken for richly brewed coffee from a restaurant or from your home coffee machine, not even if you douse it with cream, but instead I compare it to ""office"" coffee, or 'cafe au cube farm', which it definitely matches in taste and quality. Easy, quick, mellow. Great idea when I'm the only soul who wants a cup of coffee and can't bear to brew just one or two lonely cups. The big disadvantage of instant coffee, as far as I'm concerned, is that a serving of this product has only abut 65mg of caffeine compared to 45-180mg of caffeine in a brewed cup of coffee (we're talking in the upper end the way I brew mine!). I want my caffeine! The flavored versions of this product have even less caffeine per serving (at 25-30mg) although I couldn't tell you why. (This information, by the way, comes from the Nescafe website FAQ.) The other disadvantage, I suppose, is that the whole house doesn't fill with the sound and fragrance of brewing coffee when I choose to go instant. Alas. Still, given the convenience and the decency of the beverage itself, I'm now buying these little ""single sticks"" pretty regularly! Recommended. :-) …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 improper seal = botulism risk!,1,I ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner. One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped. We were lucky because I just happened to check that one. Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times. I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it. I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer. Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?! These are 2nd foods but please note that they're much more watery than Gerber or Beech-Nut 2nd foods. I think the watered texture frustrates my son and I spill it everywhere when I feed him.

 Nice snack that lasts!,5,"This bar has cranberries, almonds, and macadamia nuts (NOT bits and pieces!) as their main ingredients, in a soft honey-like glaze to keep it all together. I refrigerate them in the summer or they kind of ""wilt"". The ingredients are fresh, and the nuts are crunchy. What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them. Those nuts are meant to be chewed and not inhaled, unlike a lot of snacks that disappear as soon as you get the wrapper off. I can't eat one in front of my favorite dog, as this is one snack I am too fond of to share with her... much to her dismay.

 Healthy Option,4,"Pros: No added sugar (1 g per 2 Tbsp serving) No added salt (30 mg per serving) Great taste Organic No stirring needed Cons: Expensive, even for sunflower butter (we paid $6.20 per jar here at Superstore, with free shipping) Thin consistency (closer to a pourable topping than a 'butter') A bit higher in calories than many nut/seed butters (220 cal per serving) This makes a nice optional butter for anyone with allergies (facility is peanut and tree nut free) or someone just looking for variety. It is a bit messy to use because of how thin it is. On the plus side, though, I'm sure I use less than a serving on my sandwich to avoid having it drip or squirt out, which keeps calories lower. It remains thin when refrigerated, which the package recommends after opening to maintain freshness. We eat a reduced sodium and low sugar diet, and did find that we could tell that this was made without either. It is definitely less sweet than a ""no added sugar"" peanut butter. Since we usually make our sandwiches with either a banana or strawberries, we didn't mind the missing sweetness, but someone used to a more traditional butter product may.

 Comments from a professional chef,5,"I would like to make this short and sweet. For the people that are experimenting and enjoying finding out what amazing things this product can do---- well done. For those of you giving it a negative review--- you're ignorant. I mean that in the nicest most literal way. As a professional Chef that has traveled the world working in many of the best restaurants in the WORLD I can tell you from first hand experience that this product is intended for things that I am guessing you just DO NOT understand. For example: Take a fish as thin as sole. You cannot actually 'sear' the fish to get nice caramelization on the flesh without overcooking it. This 'searing' is to acquire what is called the maillard reaction. The maillard reaction is the caramelization of the natural proteins, amino acids and sugars found in the meat or fish product. You do this to bring out the flavor--- it makes a HUGE difference. So, if you sear the thin filets it will overcook. Use the meat glue and you can 'glue' two filets together thus acquiring the nice brown color and NOT overcook the fish.... Easy peasy...... Get a clue and don't comment on things you don't understand. Ignorant as I mentioned before. …",14 out of 18 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 I Thought I Hated Coconut Water (Until Zico Chocolate!),5,"Having heard many people express their undying love for coconut water, last year I decided to try some. After about the first sip of the plain unadulterated coconut water I got at the grocery store I knew it and I were not going to be friends. I couldn't even force myself to finish the carton. I could not figure out why everyone was so excited about it and decided it just wasn't for me. Then, one day earlier this month I saw Zico Chocolate in the cold case at a convenience store, sandwiched between juices and sports drinks. I was hesitant to buy it considering my previous experience with coconut water but the lure of chocolate was too much. I am so glad that I decided to go for it! Zico Chocolate could not be more different from plain coconut water. The weird (almost like bad molasses) flavor I found so unappealing in the plain was missing completely from the Zico Chocolate. Because they added some coconut cream it is ever so mildly creamy and the chocolate is nice and rich like semisweet dark chocolate. Just like plain coconut water it has an enticing naturally occurring nutrient content including some calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, vitamin A, and phosphorus. The only nutritional downside is that there is some added sugar, bringing the total sugar for one 14 oz bottle up to 18 grams. However, for me drinking a Zico Chocolate is often a replacement for either a dessert or a sweetened iced tea so I'm not really ingesting any more sugar than I normally would be. If you don't mind the added sugar and/or haven't been pleased with the taste of other coconut water I highly recommend trying Zico Chocolate. This last bit is about buying from Superstore and not about the product itself. This is the first time I've bought this particular product from Superstore and I am very happy with the purchase. It cost me significantly less per bottle to have it shipped by the case from Superstore using subscribe & save than it costs to buy in any store near me ($.75 - $1.00 less per bottle). Although buying it this way made it ineligible for Prime 2-day shipping, the box still arrived here the day after I ordered it and in perfect condition; that is good customer service!!! …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Not Convinced it is Grape Seed Oil,1,"I bought a gallon of this and when it came it was not green like grape seed oil but a nearly-clear yellow. I pan fried some eggs with a touch of this oil and instead of the neutral flavor of grape seed oil which doesn't change the flavor of the eggs, I could taste this oil and it tasted a bit fishy like Canoloa oil or some ""off"" vegetable oil. With all of the differences in international standards for Extra Virgin olive oil, I'm convinced this is a blend of refined oils some of which are Canola (rapeseed oil) rather than grape seed oil. I don't believe grape seed oil is as well regulated as olive oil. I do not blame the distributor as much as the processor but either way I'm returning it. I also received a batch as a gift but I'm not able to return that since it is food so I'll try to make soap with it and see how it goes.

" good in shakes, but not plain!",3,"If this had the same amount of calories as ice cream, or even frozen yogurt, I would be giving the product 1 star. However, part of the appeal of Arctic Zero is that it is so low in calories. It is important to note that this is not ice cream nor does it taste like ice cream. I found that when I ate it straight out of the carton, it had a slightly weird aftertaste. My advice to anyone who orders Arctic Zero is that you should go into it with the idea that you're going to get a frozen protein shake rather than the idea that you're going to get an amazing ice cream for only 64 calories for a cup. That would be too good to be true. While I wouldn't eat Arctic Zero (at least not the chocolate peanut butter, which is the only flavor that I've tried) plain, I found that it does make for a good base for shakes (although, I would probably not purchase this product again). When I mixed it with a few other ingredients like milk, ice, fruit, cocoa powder, better 'n peanut butter, etc. I found that the strange aftertaste disappeared and I was left with a distinct chocolate flavor with a hint of peanut in the background. Again, I will warn you, do not spend the money for this product if you're hoping to find a low calorie ice cream substitute. As I stated above, that's not what you're going to get! Edited to add: I have to add one thing that I'm hoping that I'm wrong about. I'm wondering if the company is writing some product reviews to encourage (or mislead) others to buy their product. I certainly don't want to point the finger at anyone. However, I find it hard to believe that there are so many reviews that state that the product tastes like a rich and decadent desert. I find it hard to believe that anyone would claim that this product is mind-blowingly good or that it could be compared to regular ice cream, unless they had something to gain by doing so. Read the reviews for yourself and pay attention to the dates in which they were written as well as the fact that the good reviews seem to be rated as helpful, whereas the bad reviews are frequently either rated as unhelpful or are commented on by someone who seems to be invested in Arctic Zero. Perhaps I am wrong, as I have no real evidence to support my assumption. However, something doesn't seem quite right, and that needs to be addressed considering how pricey the product is. …",142 out of 144 users found this review helpful

 Good Product and Excellent Customer Service,5,"At first, we did not get along. It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements. Good coarse grind, check. No grounds around lid before closing, check. Not too full, check. Seated properly in Keurig, check. My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help. I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews. The next morning, we tried something different. We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine. That helped, a lot. The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine. Perfection! I cannot explain why, but it worked. I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail! We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean. We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank. Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug. …",88 out of 88 users found this review helpful
 Makes a big difference,5,"We used to just dump our compostable kitchen stuff straight into the composting crock, and it was always a horrendous mess when we would carry it out to the main compost bin to empty. Now that I've started using these bags, it's a much less unpleasant task (and we empty the crock more often now, too, because we aren't both trying to put the task off hoping the other will break down and do it instead! :D ) A couple of caveats: the bags ARE, as advertised, biodegradable, so if you leave them in the crock full of wet kitchen scraps for too long, they will start to seep liquid out into the crock. It's more like osmosis - they don't really seem to develop holes at this point, but they kind of ooze liquid through a little bit. I'd say five days is the maximum time you should leave them in there. If you forget and they do start to seep, however, the task of taking the bag out to the compost bin and then washing the crock is still much less objectionable, since the inside of the crock is only wet, not stuck full of coffee grounds and bits of eggshell and all that other stuff I used to hate having to clean out of it every time. They are also a bit fragile. The practice of cramming in as much stuff as you can by shoving down on top of the contents is just not a good idea here - the bags can be easily torn by hard materials such as banana stems, eggshells, grape stems and the like. So basically the upshot of the whole thing is: don't shove too much into the compost crock, remove the bags often, and you will find that these bags make your counter-top compost collecting a much more pleasant task. …",58 out of 59 users found this review helpful
 Long time user is giving it up - They sweetened it!,2,"I have been enjoyng the Special K Protein cereal for at least a year but Kellogs decided to ""improve"" it, and I say, Yuk. The ""Extra"" means they've added extra sugar! Now it does taste like cardboard, but cardboard that is sickly sweet. Another case where corporate America is determined to keep America's sweet-tooth in high gear. Thanks Kellogs, for making a good product bad. Update: A good, less sugary low-carb, high-protein substitute for this cereal is Hi-Lo Low Carb Cereal by Organic Milling, which is also available on Superstore. Hi-Lo has 1/7 the sugar of the Special K, more protein and more fiber. And it tastes better. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
" Seemed worth a try at first, but, with use, it's really hateful.",3,"Just got my first bottle. Delivery unproblematic: fulfilled by ""Superstore LLC.""; seems of good quality; came very fast. Like Barlean's flax oil, it comes in a non-trasparent-black, squeezable, very soft plastic bottle with a valve in the spout. The bottle is sealed under the cap: you gotta unscrew the cap and peel off the seal before you can use it. Press date is in September, which is a bit old, but otoh, hemp oil isn't as perishable as flax oil, so maybe it's OK. Since I've just learned of the purported health benefits of this oil, I can only comment on the taste of it: on the bottle, and here, and elsewhere online, hempseed oil is said to have a really nice, ""nutty"" flavour. Well, not true: actually, it's more medicinal/grassy, reminiscent of rosemary. Not unpleasant, but nothing special -- actually, flax is marginally better (though I don't particularly like it either). I suspect that were it not for their purported healthfulness, no one would use either of these oils. But supposedly they're good, so we'll see. Unlike flax oil (which has some solids floating in it and needs to be shaken up before use), hemp oil has a homogeneous consistency -- like any other cooking oil, except for the colour: a sort of of luminous green, believe it or not; quite a bit like antifreeze. So these are my initial impressions; I'll update this review if I discover anything noteworthy as I use it. 12/28/10: I have to bring the stars down: the taste is horrible; in a matter of days I've grown to hate it -- it's like a greasy medicine of some sort, an emetic. There's _nothing_ it's good with, it SPOILS the taste of anything you add it to. Why do health foods taste so bad? Are they really healthful or it's just hype 'cause the maker wants to sell it? I really can't recommend this product (though it was delivered fine, and in good packaging, so the manufacturing part is fine; just the oil itself is horrible). Flax oil is far less disgusting. 01/08/2011: Just poured the remaining half-bottle down the toilet. A solemn moment of personal liberation. Healthful my as. …",5 out of 14 users found this review helpful

I failed to notice that the 12 containers that Google Shopping had promised had dropped to 1 container on Superstore's page, and the $9.99 price didn't do anything to stop me believing that it was a whole case that I was buying. To add insult to injury, the shipping on 1 single 3.75 oz container was another whopping $8.99, for a grand total of $18.98, which works out to over $5 per ounce of salt.

 Great quality Food!,5,"My dog used to be on Nutro Natural Choice - recommended by a petsmart clerk... and his stool was always soft-runny and he went maybe three to five times a day. He was also very stinky. I switched him to Innova puppy food and let me tell you... the results were almost instantaneous. In a week, he stopped smelling bad and his stool became hard and he only went twice a day. It regulated his bowels so much I could not be happier. He looks better and has more energy. He will NOT go near the old food. We wanted to know if he had a taste preference as we suspected that he was eating less of his old food right before we made the switch. So we tried mixing the two foods and he would take a mouthful, spit it out on the ground, and only eat the Innova! This food is so great for him! I am so happy. Perfect ingredients for a young puppy.

 Reminds me of how A&W Root Beer tasted when I was a kid,5,"The Zevia Root Beer Flavor is one of my favorites of the Zevia flavors. It has very strong Root Beer taste which I find tastes a lot like my memories of A&W Root Beer back when I was growing up in Canada, back before they started replacing sugar with High Fructose Corn Syrup. I'm not sure if A&W Root Beer is different here in the US from Canada, as the food in the A&W restaurants here in the US is nothing like the food in A&W Canada restaurants. In any case, I love that there's nothing but all natural ingredients here, and it's naturally sugar free. This summer, I often combined the Zevia Root Beer with Clemmy's Sugar Free Vanilla Bean Ice Cream to make my own Sugar Free Root Beer Floats (and sometimes with Orange Zevia instead of the Root Beer) and they were absolutely amazing guilt free Floats. …",25 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Sweet flavor instead of Greens flavor,2,"I try to buy organic when I can. These puffs received great reviews, and advertise their low sugar content. The ""Greens"" flavor made me think that... they will taste like greens! It seemed like a great find. Greens- Well, there might be ""greens"" in these puffs but you sure can't taste any of it. What do they taste like? They taste sweet- an outer coating of sweetness, followed by a rice puff flavor. I do not agree with another reviewer who says that they are ""just like Cheerios"". Sugar content- They might have only 0.5g of sugar per serving, but compared with Cheerios this is still double the sugar (those have 1 in 28g). Not that Cheerios are the measure for all baby snacks, and they are certainly not organic, but they are at least not sweet tasting. Packaging- You will receive a box with six plastic dispensers similar to the ones you get for wipes. Each container contains 2.1 oz (60 g) of rice puffs. The containers are so light you could think they are empty. The packaging is complete overkill. No wonder babies may like these- they taste sweet! …",53 out of 67 users found this review helpful

If I believed it were a healthier option for my 6 cats, I would have continued to spend the 35 bucks a bag. By-product, meal, and added vitamins turn me off. I will continue to feed my cats IAMS (which is not really better, in my opinion, just 13 bucks less expensive) because they always want food available to them as I search for a reasonably priced and truly healthy food.

" Great machine, lousy coffee",1,"On a recent trip to Holland I had the opportunity to experience your excellent Senseo coffee. I liked it so much that upon my return to Seattle I immediately checked for the machine's availability in the United States and was thrilled to find it at Superstore . Last week I bought the Senseo machine along with four boxes of medium roast decaffeinated pods. I also received one package of regular medium roast and one package of mild roast with the Senseo machine. <p> To my horror all of the coffee I received is a very poor substitute of the Douwe Egberts coffee I enjoyed so much in Holland. The coffee that was delivered to me is weak and tasteless. In fact, to get halfway decent coffee I have to use two pods for one four-ounce cup. This is unacceptable not only from the point of view of expense, it also limits the use of the machine to one four-ounce serving at the time. <p> I request that you provide Senseo coffee machine users here with the same quality coffee you sell in Holland (at $16.99 for a four-pack of pods it is more than twice as expensive here, which I'm willing to pay only if the coffee is of the same superior quality). Starbucks is a huge success in this country because it sells real coffee, not some watered-down version of the real thing.<p> Until I receive quality coffee to substitute for the poor coffee I now have, I will tell my friends, neighbors, colleagues and anybody else who might be interested not to invest in the Senseo machine. In the meantime I would be happy to return the coffee to you because I have no use for it. Please let me know when and how you expect to remedy this situation. If I do not hear from you within a week or so I will return the Senseo machine and the remaining unused portion of the coffee to Superstore for a full refund.<p> I look forward to hearing from you. …",14 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Like Something You might find for sale at a four year olds juice stand,1,"I, too, first tasted this at a ""caf&eacute; next to the Moulin Rouge in Paris"" it was about 90 degrees and reminded me of water from a hose washing over an old orange in the middle of the Sahara on a rather off day. In fact I venture to guess that's how its made with the bubbles that are there by some process of heat related fermentation. My experience in 1976 after ordering was regretting the 4 bucks just spent getting it, but I defend myself by saying I was so thirsty and hoping for a cold drink. Ha ha. I was later to realize that o get that kind of experience you had a better shot by freezing bottles of water in the US, putting in dry ice and hoping for a positive customs experience. That was a far, far better way to obtain a cool drink. At least in Vienne France if gave the nice inn keeper a twenty I got free use of a tiny fridge, which he found remarkably strange to use for my juice, colas or water. But that's off topic. Here's what you get for the almost four dollars per bottle, a weak watered slightly sweet beverage with a cross of what I hold is a mandarin and orange pulp, minor amount of pulp, some rather dingy looking stuff that's settled in the bottom that's grainy and a lot of off carbonated water. It's what my husband calls (poor word) water, but he likes them. For him they fill a sentimental niche. For me they say....France was very expensive. But I adored much about the travel and the country. I do like the bottles. I save them, peel off the labels and use them for rosemary in oil and other kinds of herbed oils I like to make. So if he'll drink it up, or I can pawn it off on some unaware visitor then I've got a nice bottle to use making bath oils. Great for lavendar scented bath potions. If you love it, give up on me in this regard. This is not a Sam-I -Am-Moment for the two of us.

 Techno-BEST,5,"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek. There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine. The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup. This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion. It's easy to hold and get out of the machine. The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier. This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut. Ingenious.

" Like I was back in Tuscany, but also makes great American coffee",5,"I want to start by addressing the people giving low ratings because the beans aren't ""oily"" enough. If you've ever had a real espresso, one made by a licensed barista in Italy, you'd know that espresso beans aren't oily; they're not even usually that dark. If you see black beans, you're going to get a bitter cup of coffee no matter how you make it. It is the fresh grinding process and pressurized steam that make espresso so dark and strong in the cup, not burnt beans! This coffee is used in the great majority of Italian households and restaurants; I think most of the bars use a different brand but some of the ones I frequented around Florence used Lavazza. I can tell you from first-hand experience that when you order an espresso in Italy, the barista doesn't get beans that look black...that only happens at Starbucks where they don't care about the coffee being bitter because, as these low-star reviewers prove, a lot of American coffee drinkers wouldn't know how coffee is supposed to look or taste. These beans are the perfect color; medium to dark brown, uniformly roasted. When you grind them, the aroma fills the kitchen. (By the way detractors, that's another way to tell good coffee. If you don't get a big release of aroma when you grind the beans, it means they've been over-roasted and the oils are all gone...perhaps except for that little sheen you want to be on the surface...I'd rather have the oils still in the bean, personally.) Just for the fun of it, I decided to test this against my favorite coffee for my drip coffee maker. I was actually quite surprised at how rich, dark, and mellow the coffee came out of a rather poor (but quick and convenient) method of making coffee. I knew this would make perfect espresso, but I honestly didn't think the American-style coffee methods would work so well too. There is even a bit of crema on top of the cup...from a drip coffee maker! To see how much foam you get from an espresso machine, check out the pictures I've posted at the top of the page. Lavazza is now going to be the only brand of coffee in my house. This is as close as you can get to drinking a fresh cup of espresso on the streets of Florence without a plane ticket. …",71 out of 79 users found this review helpful

They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal. Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein.

 NO waste at all ----  great for training  ----  all dogs love liver treats,5,"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.) Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels). Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs. The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product. There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Here's the nutritional analysis: -100% freeze dried liver -NO additives or preservatives. -Crude protein..... not less than 50% -Crude fat..... not less than 5% -Crude fiber..... not more than 3% -Moisture..... not more than 6% …",39 out of 51 users found this review helpful
 OMG It WORKS!,5,"I have been using this product for almost a week now and my only complaint is that I didn't find pit about it sooner! First, a bit about myself. I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess! I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM. Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep! Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too. Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day! I feel so much lighter, my friends and family always said I was full of **** and I guess they were right! I guess after reading my review you are thinking either she is being paid for this or it really works, well it is definitely the latter! It is working for me and I believe it will work for you too, try it what have you got to lose besides a crappy mood, sleepless night, a lot of **** and cramps? Jeez, I think $23.00 is a pretty fair trade off don't you. One more thing the dosage that I am using is two teaspoons at night and one teaspoon in the morning, both with 3 teaspoons of benefiber mixed in girl still needs her fiber! and BTW it's a store brand).

 Natural Sweetener,5,"Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar, this item caught my attention when I read it was an ingredient in ""Xylichew"" chewing gums. Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day. It is commercially manufactured from ""xylan hemicellulose"" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. This ""NOW"" Xylitol is actually made from a corn source. Xylitol actually has been proven to: Reduce Tooth Decay Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel Xylitol is believed to be safe, but doses higher than 30 g per day can cause stomach discomfort. To sweeten one cup of tea, you may need as much as 3 teaspoons which is 12 grams. This would equal 30 calories and 12 grams of Carbohydrates. Each teaspoon contains: Total Fat 0g Sugars 0g Sugar Alcohol 4g Sodium 0mg Protein 0g ""Now"" Xylitol is 100% Pure Xylitol Powder. This product resembles sugar and has a third fewer calories than table sugar. It is a good alternative for diabetics and can be used as a sugar substitute in recipes. Calculate how much each serving will contain to make sure you can use this ingredient in your recipes. When compared to the SoooLite! NoCarbs Blend, this product does have Carbohydrates and more Calories. If you are looking for a No Carbs blend sweetner, NuNaturals SoooLite! Is perfect for tea.

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 The Quintessential Breakfast Tea.,4,"Calling this blend ""English"" Breakfast is a bit of a misnomer, because it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name ""breakfast tea."" It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word ""English,"" which has been part of its name ever since. English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday ""work horse,"" and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee. …",9 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Great Crackers But You'll Regret Buying Them From Superstore,1,"These are excellent graham crackers. We love 'em, and the kids do too, and it's not often that we agree. But you'll be sorry if you order graham crackers -- or any other food that can be damaged in shipping -- from Superstore. Our recent order arrived in the original box from the factory, containing 12 boxes of New Morning Honey Grahams. That was it. No packing material. Nothing to shield the crackers from the drops and shocks of being shipped to us. So we didn't get graham crackers. We got graham crumbs, and a few graham cracker fragments. By all means, order these crackers. Just don't order them from Superstore. Instead, find a retailer that knows how to do it right, or buy them from your local grocery.

 I also received nearly-expired product,1,"I should start by saying I love the Starbux Via coffees - they really are good ""emergency"" coffee. I normally brew my own espresso every day, but I use the Via packs when I don't have time for that and need to hit the road with my caffeine fix. I rated this product 1 star because like other reviewers, I too received a 50-ct box of nearly expired product. When you buy this stuff in the store it has roughly a one year shelf life. The box I was sent expires in two months. A box of 50 is like a one year supply for me. If I had known they are selling these boxes at such a good price because they are about to expire, I would have passed on this ""bargain"". But if you plan to drink them all in a month or two, it is a good buy. …",17 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 Some Education About Vegan Cats,1,"Unfortunately most people are ill informed about vegan cats, including most veterinarians. Wild cats are in fact obligate carnivores. However, in domesticating the house cat and bringing it into our homes we have effectively removed the cat from its natural prey of mice, insects, birds, lizards, and other small creatures. During the past 100 years or so, as the human food industry was searching for a way to salvage and use all the waste materials from its processing lines, it came upon a wonderful solution. Lets boil it all up and dry it out and add it to the food we make for cats and dogs. As a result, the vast majority of commercial pet foods contain what are euphemistically referred to as the four D's, dead, dying, disabled, and diseased animals, along with other quite undesirable materials. Quite frankly, if you are feeding this junk to your pets, you are effectively poisoning them. We are seeing diseases in pets today that we have never seen before because of the wide variety of contaminated ingredients that are finding their way into the food we feed our companion animals. You know ""garbage in, garbage out!"" Now the issue here is not meat; it is about providing all the essential and non-essential amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and vitamins and minerals that are bio-available to the particularly unique physiology of felids (cats). The quality, quantity, and availability of these nutrients can come from any source, and for those of us who are vegan, the best source is vegetable based. Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of cats around the world live quite well on one of the several available vegan cat foods that are recognized as nutritionally complete. I personally have had 3 1/2 years of experience in feeding the Evolution kibble product that this review is addressing. It is a high quality product that is AAFCO certified as nutritionally complete for all life stages in cats. Not only is this product safe to feed your cat, but if you follow the recommended feeding procedures, you will find many benefits to both your cat's health and your wallet. If you desire more detailed information, I invite you to do a google search on vegan cats. I would put my web page information about this issue on this review, but it is against the policy for writing reviews on Superstore. Just for everyone's edification, I have researched this issue for well over 500 hours, read hundreds of technical papers, visited hundreds of web sites, and have made a commitment to specialize in feline nutrition as part of my Veterinary Technician studies. I probably know more about feline nutrition than 95% of all the vets in the world. My feline son is a vegan and will remain so because I am absolutely certain that his quality of life will be enhanced by his diet and that this choice will not be a detriment to his health. ------------------------------------- Since writing this review in 2006 I have had a change in position about this particular product after 4 years of personal experience. The manufacturer of the Evolution foods was changing the formulation of the food on a regular basis and during that time I found that the Feline Kibble was not able to maintain the pH level in the urine of cats that was promised on the label and in their literature. At least that wasn't the case with my former feline son and my current feline son. As a result I can no longer recommend the use of Evolution Feline Kibble for male cats. Since urinary issues are different between male and female cats the Evolution Kibble MAY be satisfactory for feeding to female cats. Nutritionally the Evolution foods seem to be fine for nutrients but not necessarily adequate for maintaining the proper pH levels to avoid urinary issues for male cats. Consequently I am now recommending male cats use the Vegecat pH diet provided by Harbingers of a New Age. My son has been eating this food supplement in a specially prepared gluten formulation I created called a vegan feline roast. It is 62% protein, 33% fat, and 5% carbs and has a moisture content of about 60%. Almost a perfect combination of ingredients to mimic natural prey. My son finds this product to be very palatable and his urinary pH has been consistently at 6.4 for the three years that we have been producing and consuming this food. The drawback is that it takes about a half hour every 3 days to make the food and the cost is equivalent to a premium cat food. But on the other hand my son is trim, full of energy at 6 1/2 years, enjoys great health, no longer has urinary tract issues, and no other animal had to die in order to provide my son with life-giving nutrition. UPDATE: 4/17/11 For those of you who are still considering feeding the Evolution kibble, please heed this warning. Kibble is only 10% moisture content. If you follow the directions given by the manufacturer to soak the kibble prior to feeding, you will end up with a mushy material that your cats may or may not like. The danger in feeding the dry kibble is that your cat will eventually become so dehydrated that no amount of drinking will be sufficient to avoid hydration related illnesses. Cats do not naturally drink water, they almost exclusively obtain all of their hydration from the food that they consume. If they are eating something that only has 10% moisture, upon consumption the moisture that is contained within the digestive tract of the cat will be sucked into the food in order to give it enough fluidity to pass through the intestines. This will often lead to gastro-intestinal diseases. Your cat will be constantly drinking water to make up for that deficiency, but no amount of drinking is enough to avoid the dehydration problem. So please remember that the best source of moisture for your cat's health, comes from a wet food diet that is around 70% moisture. In October 2008 I wrote an article about vegan cats published in VegFamily magazine. This information and more will help those who are interested in a vegan diet for cats understand more of the issues. UPDATE: 8/27/12 My vegan feline son is now 8 years old and still maintains an extremely healthy life with absolutely no issues of any kind. He has been using our Vegan Feline Roast product for the past 5 and 1/2 years and his lab tests indicate that his nutritional needs are being adequately met by his vegan diet. For those who are sceptical about a vegan diet for house cats, there is ample evidence that several vegan products are available to satisfy the nutritional needs of cats. I am still not convinced that Evolution is a good product to feed based on my past history. There are thousands of customers that seem to successfully feed the Evolution product; however, I believe that our Vegan Feline Roast Mix is a superior product that will yield far better results over the lifetime of feeding any house cat. Our product is based on the Vegecat phi supplement offered by HOANA, which I have found to be an excellent product for hitting all of the missing nutritional elements that would otherwise come from meat. The Vegecat product line has been successfully feeding thousands of cats over a 27 year period and we highly recommend the use of Vegecat for those people who wish to formulate their own vegan cat food. The only difference between our food product and the HOANA vegecat product is that our product is a ready-to-make mix that has been specifically formulated for a high protein/high fat food that is easy to make and highly palatable to the vast majority of cats. I would caution people feeding the Evolution kibble to reconsider doing so. The problem with kibble in general, not just the Evolution product, is the 10% moisture content of the food. Cats that eat kibble exclusively will invariably become dehydrated and will not be able to consume enough water by drinking to avoid the condition. Evolution kibble that is soaked with water prior to feeding, as recommended by the manufacturer, is an attempt to avoid this issue. However, by soaking the product you will reduce the palatability quality to most cats and will make it harder for them to continue to want to eat the product. This is a strategy to fix a problem that is inherent to the product itself. As time goes on, I become more convinced that using our Vegan Feline Roast product may in fact be a cure for diseases in cats like FLUTD and diabetes. At some point in time I would like to perform a long term double blind scientifically significant study to support my empirical observations. When my son started out 7 years ago eating Evolution kibble, he quickly developed a FLUTD condition, after 18 months of use, that cost $1500 at the vet to fix. The last 5 1/2 years of eating nothing but our Vegan Feline Roast he has remained FLUTD free and maintains excellent health. Just the savings alone from avoiding annual teeth cleaning has more than paid for itself in the use of our product. So my bottom line is to recommend not using Evolution Kibble in favor of either the HOANA vegecat supplement or our Vegan Feline Roast Mix. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Contains SPLENDA - yuck,1,"The product description claims ""It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors."" This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether ""diet"" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the ""Dr. Pepper"": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA?

 Rather weak and non-descript tea,2,"There are several other Stash teas that I've tried and enjoyed. But this one is sort of feeble-tasting. Up until now, I've gotten the Yogi Tea Egyptian Licorice Tea Organic Egyptian Licorice, Tea Bags, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) and that one actually has a bold licorice taste. And it is that one that is serving as the point of comparison to this Stash tea. Keep in mind that I don't add honey or any sweetner to my teas, so they have to stand on their own. This Stash Licorice Spice has a weak licorice taste and a weak spice taste. I have to use TWO teabags at a time (which makes the seemingly low price not so much a good deal). …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Not just for breakfast anymore,5,"This salt is seriously fantastic. Lots of folks say there isn't a difference in taste from salt to salt. IMO, not true. Natural salt has minerals going for it that may make it milder than old fashioned sodium chloride. I'm sure all this can be debated. This Maldon (aka English Sea Salt) is super chunky and crunchy. It's milder than normal salt, IMO and tastes great on just about everything. Also, ""milder"" doesn't mean ""add more salt"". I like to use this as a finishing salt to add a flavorful crunch to pan fried asparagus with black pepper and garlic, or sprinkle lightly on meats just before serving.

I put some salt and pepper on it and it is much better than the original mix and takes about the same amount of time. I like the idea of adding a bit of spice to it as well and will try that next time.

 The Real Thing,5,"When it comes to sardines, Portugal is the center of the world - those that hail from its territorial waters are known to be the best and command a higher price as a result of their status as the real thing. But are they really better than their Spanish cousins, or those scooped out of adjacent waters by the Moroccan fleet? A recent flurry of studies on the inconsistencies of professional blind tastings of wine calls things into question. If highly trained experts can't routinely get it right when rating expensive vintages, how much credence should anyone be placing on the sardine selections of Superstore reviewers? It's up to you. Now, having issued this disclaimer I'll jump right in. These fish just taste great. Their flesh is both fat and firm, with a delicate aroma (though my daughter would argue they stink), and a fine lingering finish. Presentation is impeccable. The plump pilchards are tightly packed into a heavy-duty rip top tin. You'll be amazed at the metallic sheen of their delicate skin. It attests to the freshness of these bad boys at the moment of their canning. Does this seem over the top as it relates to lowly sardines? Not at all. In fact this is a case where the last will indeed be first. Being at the bottom of the food chain sardines are free from concentrations of all manner of toxins. At the same time, they score high in their content of Omega-3 fatty acids. What could be better? But are these any better than all the rest? You bet. I eat `em every day.

 The Best!,5,"I've been buying little disposable cat grass kits for a few years now and this one is far superior to the others. What I love most is that when the kitties eat the grass, they can't pull the container around or tip it over because of the wooden base. It's nice and sturdy. Kitties love the grasses. I paid between $1.99 and $3.99 for the disposable grass kits and they only lasted a few weeks at best. I bought this over a month ago and the grass is still growing strong, so it is a great value. I also bought some refills to save on shipping, and I'm glad I did. Out of 3 cats, only 1 doesn't eat the grass (at least not when I'm looking). Some people have mentioned that the seeds didn't sprout and it got moldy. I had no problems at all. You need to be sure to keep the seeds moist (a spray bottle works great) yet also be sure to empty any water left in the bottom so it doesn't sit in water. If you're dilligent the first few days, I think you will increase your chances of success. But I wonder if maybe the people who experienced mold might have started their kits during cooler weather...that could increase the chances of mold rather than germination. Be sure to put in a sunny or very bright window (warmer temps) right after planting. No doubt that I will be buying the refills for this for years. If you're worried that your kitty may not eat the grass, just buy a cheapie disposable one to test it out first...if he/she eats it, you will surely have a hit with the 4 grasses that come with this one! …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Changed for the WORSE,1,"These used to be my favorite allergy friendly snack that I did not have to make myself.

 My cat loves it,5,"My 1 year old Siberian cat, Mimic, loves this stuff. He would prefer to eat only the dry Taste of the Wild for ever and ever. But I do worry about his urinary health, so I supplement with some wet food every day. He used to be on Merrick wet, but when my local store started carrying the Taste of the Wild wet, I gave it a try, and now it's the only wet food he'll eat. I don't know what kind of addictive substance they put in the food (my guess is it's the sweet potato, which is kind of an unusual cat food ingredient), but he loves it. I also know that his breeder uses it now, as do a few of my friends. And all of the cats seem to love the stuff. If you can find the canned, try it. It smells similar, so I'd bet that any cat who likes the dry would like the wet. It is a kind of chunky food in gravy, where the chunks are like tiny pieces of meatloaf. Ultimately, I have not found a better balance of price, quality of ingredients, and palatability for Mimic. …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful
