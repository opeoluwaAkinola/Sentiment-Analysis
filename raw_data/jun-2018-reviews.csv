 Tired of plain water? Enjoy this lemonade on the go,4,"I love lemonade but 2-3 in one day is too much sugar. Crystal Light is a nice replacement. I drink more of this in the summer than Crystal Light's peach tea. The On-The-Go packages are easy to carry and I keep a box at my office and several packets in my glove box. I've reviewed several of the Crystal Light and Lipton drink mixes. My favorite flavors are iced tea, peach tea, lemonade and raspberry lemonade. All of these are a nice change of pace from drinking plain water and I've found that I enjoy them best when they are slushy cold. Here's my recipe for a perfect drink: I add the drink mix packet to my Chug Bottle , an inexpensive water bottle perfect for Crystal Light and Lipton packets. Then, I add 12 oz of water and fill the rest of the bottle with crushed ice. After 30 seconds of shaking I've got an ice-cold drink. Bottom line: Are you tired of drinking plain water all the time? You can save money by skipping bottled teas. These drink mixes are handy at home, at the office and on the road - anywhere you want to avoid drinking your calories.

 Excellent buy,5,"I am not some kind of caviar snob but I have had the very expensive down to lumpfish from the local grocery store. I was so surprised at the extremely fresh taste and mild flavor. It even had the ""pop"" of the expensive brands.

 Great for Breakfast,5,"I make a wonderful hot breakfast cereal with amaranth, a chopped apple, milk, cinnamon and a little stevia.

 Mixed Experience - Watership Down Reenactment Prop,3,"I waited with baited breath for the arrival of the 20 Fresh Whole Rabbit's to arrive so my children and I could begin production of our own Watership Down Reenactment. Shipping was lightening fast and our props arrived securely packed in dry ice. Imagine my surprise when I found that the heads and paws of my little actors were missing?!?! They don't even have skin. I can handle the lack of internal organs of course. What really matters are the external features of stage props. Not to be defeated my 12 year old daughter made a resourceful suggestion. Why should we not replace the missing head and limbs with paper machete. This is the sort of innovation that convinces me that Tabitha has a destiny on Broadway!!! Despite the inconvenience of having to build the body parts I must say these carcasses are well suited to the task. They are easy to perforate with wire. A brushing of super glue and a roll in fuzz and we have our little actors. Also: They are posse able to a certain degree if you wire them in place. This was very helpful for certain scenes in our production. One more negative however, after 5 dress rehearsals our little actors smell quite bad. This is, in my opinion a design flaw that should be part of this product description. For that reason I am giving this 3 stars. Sure it was workable material but it was not everything I should get for paying so much for 20 of these! …",16 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Core Wellness food is not what it used to be,1,"See the Core Wellness forums for confirmation. They are shifting the formula now that they have been bought out by Berwind Corporation. A note was in our last bag of food confirming this, and with the most recent bag, the food has a whiter appearance and our cats actively refuse to touch it. This leaves us in a bind because we have a cat that requires grain-free food. I will not be going back to this product ever again. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Every dog is different,5,"I've always been interested in nutrition, and spent a LOT of time researching different dog foods. It REALLY bothers me that there's no longer an element of ""common-sense"" with how people view dog foods. Scraps and treats do wonders for a lot of (less sensitive) dogs, and dogs on unarguably bad foods can be very healthy dogs if they have other sources of nutrition. So, take all of this with a grain of salt - some foods, good or bad, will work and not work for some dogs. Better foods do work best for most dogs, but A LOT of these foods are too rich for certain dogs. My now 2.5 year old standard poodle was eating Iams puppy for the first 4 months of his life. He had mushy, grainy, light colored poop (like picking it up with a pooper scooper leaves behind a mess), occasional vomiting/diarrhea and was on the thin side. I gradually switched him to: Wellness Core Innova Blue buffalo Back to Iams in between for a couple of weeks, once it was obvious the food wasn't working for him. Some of the above resulted in horrible diarrhea. ALL were very smelly once they went through him. Are they still good foods in my opinion? Yes, but not for everyone! After months I'd rather forget, Castor and Pollux was honestly one of the best discoveries of my life! I HIGHLY recommend it to people with dogs sensitive to very rich / high protein foods, as it seems to be less so. My friends/family with dogs are jealous that my dog is ""the best pooper ever"" - firm, dark, moist poop with little odor. And that is way too many adjectives to describe poop. Ew. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
" This is ""the one""",5,"I have been taste-testing so many brands and roasts of k-cups to determine our favorites that I feel like a 'lab rat.' The Tully's Italian Roast immediately stood out from the rest--love at first sip! The other reviews are accurate by describing it as aromatic, smooth and flavorful, not bitter nor weak. I make my first cup of the morning by using one k-cup on the large cup setting, then I make my add'l cups of coffee using one k-cup and a combination of both the middle and smallest cup; that way I get more coffee using one K-cup. It still holds a robust flavor but just not as heavily as the first, which is what I like to do after drinking sev'l cups. I use cream & sugar, so this routine works for me. You may or may not tend to tweak your ritual the same way, but it just goes to show you that you can ""think out of the k-cup."" …",32 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 Not fit for human consumption.,1,"I was very excited when i saw this product, i'm one of those people eager to try anything, and I've had exotic meats before in a number of ways, through friends that hunt I've enjoyed home made dishes made from a wide variety of game animals, and i've had less common animals like ostrich, kangaroo, and aligator that i ordered on like and cooked myself, and i've even had a few of these meats as jerky by other companies. I like the meats of the animals they made these jerkies from, i need to stress that point, because otherwise you may think that is what my problem is. it's not, this product was AWFUL!! these were some of the worst cured meat snacks I've ever had. Is it possible to rate something and give it no stars? because that is what this product deserves. the meat managed somehow to be both bland and surprisingly foul, and coated with enough grease to lubricate an engine. I have tried several of the strips and sticks and found that to be a universal condition. I can only think that the people who wrote the rave reviews for this product did so without tasting it. this is dreadful stuff, suited only for those who simply want the novelty of claiming they ate strange animals and don't care what it tasted like. this meat was not fit for human consumption, in fact, i wouldn't even give it to my dog. I won't be buying anything else from buffalo bob. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" Trivedi Water, $windled with Divine Energy.",1,"This is a Divine Energy $windle. The placebo effect may work fine if you hypnotize easily. The ""science"", upon which Mr. Trivedi's whole foundation is based, was invalidated. Selling water ""Infused with Divine Energy"" and claiming it is better for you because it is changed at a molecular level, for the purpose of charging an inflated price, when in fact it is not changed in any way, is a violation of U.

 Great Stuff,5,"As for the quality of this food if you're unfamiliar with holistic foods, this stuff is top quality. It has many forms of meat, no grains whatsoever, and no controversial ingredients, etc... You know the drill, a top quality food that is unavailable in grocery stores. Actually one of the best on the market amongst hundreds of different kinds. This stuff is pricey but your dog will eat less so it sort of offsets the price a bit. With regular food your dog is eating corn, potato peelings, rotten rice, and animal guts and blood swept off the floor of the slaughter house. That food is so low in nutrients your dog must eat tons of it and poop out all the poison that shouldn't be in the food. With a great food like Orijen your dog will eat less, absorb most of it, and have fewer and more solid stools. There are a few people who are a little weary of Canidae. Canidae now makes a grain free formula which is excellent. It's almost as good as Orijen and cheaper as well. If you want one of the better foods on the market and a good price, Canidae grain free is your ticket. But if you absolutely want the Lamborghini of dog foods then Orijen is your buy, although Canidae is a Porsche and still pretty darn good. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Warning: Highly Addictive,5,"I ran upon this in the grocery store and it looked like it would be good. I love spicy sauces. I thought it would be good but this is WOW! It isn't just a hot sauce, it has flavor. It is so good. It's good on chicken and eggs. It is out of this world on cottage cheese, sounds like a strange combo but I haven't tried anything that it tasted so good on, the cool of the cottage cheese, the heat of the chili sauce, yum! It does have a good bit of heat to it. I have to have something close by to drink because it does burn the tongue a little. I'm addicted now and will be a lifelong lover of this chili sauce.

 Awesome Quality,5,"True Himalayan Pink Salt. I won't bore you with all the wonderful benefits of this mineral-rich salt. I'll figure you won't be here if you aren't already aware of them. This is excellent, rich, pink salt. It is ground very well, and is suitable for use as both kitchen and table salt. It has a nice flavor and works perfectly in all our recipes. If you plan to store it in a shaker, you want to add some uncooked rice in with it, or it will lump badly. It is very fine, so it absorbs all the moisture, without rice to help it. We love the quality of this brand, and will buy more, and more. :) …",84 out of 86 users found this review helpful

 1 out of 2 dogs liked it!,4,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:42 Mins </span>Since neither of my 2 dogs can write about this new Lickety Stik, I will do my best. A new idea for treats is always welcomed. We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver. We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey. Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol). Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike. I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it. First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly. It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog. If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable. It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label. The video is one of our taste tests. Hope you enjoy it. …",19 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Not up to snuff,2,"I know that truffle aroma can be either overwhelming or subtle. People who aren't used to truffles might find it hard to notice their unique scent. Others want to stay far away from truffles. I'm in the middle. I can certainly taste them and I certainly enjoy them as an accompaniment to the appropriate foods. The La Tourangelle is too subtle for my taste. It's expensive, and for that price, it seems that they can try to infuse more truffle essence into the oil. It was difficult deciding whether to give this product two or three stars. It deserves two stars for its execution, but three stars for trying. I will be trying some others; hopefully I can point readers in another direction. --- Update as of 11/23. I did try another truffle oil...La Truffiere from JR Mushrooms and specialities. The JR version was so good that I lowered my review of this one (La Tourangelle) to two stars from three stars. I gave the La Truffiere four stars.

 PANCAKES ARE VERY GOOD - after modifying the recipe!,5,"Hi! 1st batch we made - had an unusual inside texture for a pancake - they were still very good - but .. a little wierd. The inside texture was a bit - spongy or like the way an eggs are that are whipped/beaten and then used in an omelet or breakfast casserole. A couple of days later, my son, husband and I made our 2nd batch, but this time we modified the recipe on the back. We used only 1 egg -- and that was the right modification! Now the pancakes were just like regular pancakes! They are delicious and certainly satisfy the ""pancake craving"". We always add extracts to our pancakes - usually vanilla and maple, sometimes vanilla and coconut, sometimes vanilla and banana plus walnuts! My ONLY issue is the SHIPPING cost us MORE than the product!! UGH .. bummer... nevertheless we are ordering another package - I will check to see if ordering more cost more in shipping -- if not might order 3 boxes as once. It's a shame food that is 'better' for us is always more costly -- but, that is not going to change. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Must try for storage bread,5,"I stumbled across this item, and was intrigued enough to try it. Canned bread..who would have thought! I had never heard of this product, but do like a good dark bread on occasion. The label says to open both ends of the can and push it out..we found this to be a must, as it somewhat appears to have been baked in the can;this was easy to do. Very tasty, B&M Brown Bread has a very dense texture and is nicely moist.Quite filling also. We tried it plain, and with some peanut butter and no complaints from my taste test panel :) The long term storage was a key point in my purchase, as I did not have any other options really for bread, so this is quite nice. Cans have a best by date of 26 months away from my delivery date, so it appears that they are shipping a good fresh product.

 Great alternative to artificial dye,5,"Some in my family are allergic to various artificial food colors, but my kids really didn't want a white birthday cake cause it is boring. Beet powder is the perfect coloring for us. I simply mix it with a small amount of hot water, let it sit a minute, then strain through cheesecloth. I then use the liquid in making my frosting and it is a beautiful bright pink color--prettier than standard food coloring IMO, and a perfect color for little girls' birthdays. I have also just added the powder directly to the frosting, which works but it takes a while for the color to appear full strenth and if you look closly you will see tiny dots of beet powder. I also use beet powder to make colored sugar, pouring a tiny amount of liquid on sugar, mixing well, letting it dry, and breaking up any clumps. I then use that sugar to make homemade peeps that the whole family can eat (recipe at Mine don't look nearly as good as Martha's, but they tase wonderful. I have even used beet powder to make candy canes (recipe at Instead of adding food coloring, just add some beet liquid AFTER taking the candy off the heat and cooling slightly. I have also used it in other hard candies, the only problem is that if the candy hardens before you have shaped it you can't reheat it on the stove or the beet stuff will burn, turn brown, and taste nasty. That only happens at very high temperatures, however. You can add beet powder to baked goods without burning it. This stuff goes a long way as a food coloring. One small package has lasted us a year and a half, using it a couple of times a month, and I am just now nearly done with it.

 The taste... well it may take some creativity,5,"As far as taste, what can we ask for? Plain with milk it's only passable. But heck, it's a hemp protein. Now there are ways of making it taste better and it's a nutritious product. Not too shabby is adding about a half of a decent sized frozen banana (a natural sweetener, thickener, and flavoring) to 8 oz of milk (I use organic fat free milk) to 3 tablespoons of the product. This tasted pretty good, and I would have no problem drinking it like this every day. So what I am saying is that for products like these that don't taste like a Steak and Shake milkshake or a Wendy's Frosty, one would need to experiment to find something that is suitable as far as taste to the consumer. I did think about giving four stars for taste, but it's not god awful and can be gotten around with a little creativity. Plus we are dealing with hemp here so I don't think it would be fair. This is the first hemp protein I have tried so maybe there are better tasting ones out there. However, since I like the way I made it above with the banana and may be able to find other good tasting concoctions, I may be just running risk and find something worse by seeking elsewhere. If I were to stick with this one, and I may, the bottom line then becomes final price. I am not a pure vegan although I do restrict meat intake and usually stick to salmon and chicken breasts when I do eat meat. So I use a supplement like this to fill in days when I don't get enough protein from animal products. I won't eat soy protein, trace amounts notwithstanding, and I would not put Splenda or sucralose (poison) in my system so I needed an alternative protein shake/smoothy. All the regular good tasting standard bodybuilding proteins use sucralose to sweeten them. Well, the ones I like and have used anyway. Even these latter mentioned ones that have the best relative taste, don't taste like an unhealthy milkshake anyway. Update 3/14/2012: Ok this is how I drink it now, and I love it. 8 oz of Pacific Brand organic oat non-dairy beverage (any kind of milk such as hemp, almond, or soy can be used), 1 medium banana, 1/2 cup of raw organic oatmeal (we buy this in the bulk section at Whole Foods), 4 tablespoons of this Hemp Protein, 1 packet of Sweet Leaf Stevia. This is my breakfast every other day. One can add a tablespoon of organic freshly ground (at the store which make it nothing but ground nuts) nut butter if you are not too worried about fat. To me the oatmeal really makes it great. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 A chili sauce worth crowing about,5,"Sriracha's a great early morning pick-me-up on the ol omlet. It's also great on pizza, stirfry, soups, panini sandwiches (spritz a little atop the cheese the next time you make one, and see for yourself), etc. Great for livening up roasted red pepper hummus, tomato sauces, mayonnaise, you name it. The uses are innumerable. I'm a self-avowed chili-head, and I've tried more chili sauces than I can easily count. Everyone has their favorite styles and brands, and I'm no different, because this happens to be one of mine. The thing I like about Sriracha is how the flavor and texture of freshly ground sun-ripened red chilies shine through cleanly ... there are no gritty/bitter seeds, no oxidized flavors from using reconstituted dried chilies, no caramelized/overcooked flavors, no competing heavy mismatched flavors/spices, no mouth pucking wretched excesses from being pickled in cider vinegar and salt, no fatiguing smoke flavors, no fruit juices, no excessive heat, no thermonuclear oil essence extracts, etc. Most of those things have their time, place and uses, and good examples of each abound ... but not here. No. Sriracha is just plain, beautiful, de-seeded, unobstructed, sun-ripened fresh red chili flesh, with just barely enough garlic, salt, vinegar and sugar to round it out, plus a little gaur gum to thicken it slightly, and a little sorbate for extend it's freshness. That's it. It's pleasantly piquant, but not overly so. Highly recommended. p.s.

 Great Product!,5,"ACAI Powerscoop Powder 90 Grams According to the product literature, this ACAI powder by Sambazon is organic and USDA stamped. I wanted a good antioxidant supplement to take in addition to my other supplements. It is a deep purple color, tastes good, and easily dissolves in liquid. I take mine every morning mixed into my oat bran cereal or stir it into milk or juice. I have so far purchased 4 cans, and each can lasts for about one month.

 Very Good Stout,5,"For not boiling any ingreidients this is a great beer. Just add some hot water, syrup, malt, sugar, pitch the yeast and let ferment. Thats it. I have made a lot of beer and have never had a canned extract turn out so good. Usualy when you cook beer you are in the kitchen for hours. With coopers it only takes about 10-15 minutes and you are done not to mention it tastes as good if not better than cooked beer. Once you have taken a few sips it is very similar to Guiness. It has nice flavor and finishes with a slight bitterness. Make sure to age it properly. For maximum flavor age for at least a month. The flavor will improve greatly! Enjoy. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Nice for those who eat a lot of produce,4,"We eat a lot of fresh produce, so I like to have this around. I fill up the bowl and use it over and over to wash all the produce that I've brought home from the store, or that I'm using that night. The bowl is a bit smaller than I had anticipated - I was expecting something closer in size to a standard colander, and it is quite a bit smaller than that. However, it's still generally plenty big enough for any one item I may be using, and it's easy enough to do a couple of batches. One other thing that my help to know is that the ""jugs"" are for use in the bowl, and you are supposed to use one full cap per bowl full of water. This means that the jug is used up fairly quickly if you use it every day, so it's good to be aware of that. It is pretty inexpensive, though - I just tend to use it when I know I'll be using it twice or more. (On two or more bowls of veggies.) It isn't a must-have, but for people like us who do eat a lot of fresh foods, it is a nice extra bit of insurance. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Henry's Blend? Where?,1,"Seattle's Best has obviously been taken over by idiots. That's the only explanation for this new change in product look and taste. Are they trying to market coffee to grade school children? The new product presentation in bright colored, ugly bags with huge numbers on them is so unsophisticated and juvenile that it boggles the mind as to how this piece of rubbish got rubber-stamped by any executive who loves coffee. Coffee drinkers don't appreciate this kind of flashy, cheap looking product packaging and still they've tried to keep their original customers by stamping a tiny little reminder of ""Like Henry's Blend"" on the bag. Well that just rubs salt into the wound because the taste also seems to have been tampered with. I predict that this will go the same way as the Tropicana OJ fiasco and that they'll lose sales to the point that they'll be forced to bring back their far more sophisticated packaging and blends. Luckily, I have plenty of local roasters selling coffee that I can turn to and not feel ashamed for buying such a pathetic looking product. Henry's Blend, in the traditional red bag was a sophisticated, gourmet coffee and that sadly no longer exists. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!,1,"Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned. ~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via Superstore subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that. Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered. Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this! I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can). Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell. How messed up is this? I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm. I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico. And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense. Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish! Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water. But I still miss old Zico. Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH. Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from Superstore, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH. 2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes ""just like"" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'. 3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on Superstore, so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is ""natural"" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo 4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to ""optimize"" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's ""optimized"" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to ""optimize."" (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under ""Todd O'Connor"". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor. Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified Superstore purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by ""Todd O'Connor"" and under Alio ""Alio""s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio ""Alio"" confirming the fake identity.) …",110 out of 124 users found this review helpful

 As a kitchen trash bag you MUST commit,3,"As I am attempting to ""green"" up my lifestyle, I originally bought these to use for used cat litter and dirty diapers, but ended up replacing my seventh gen kitchen trash bags (temporarily) with these neat biodegradable bags. I love the idea of them breaking down, allowing my trash a chance to biodegrade faster. These are a ""whisper of a trash bag"" and I had the most challenging task of using these during the prime summer months (Jun-Aug). My trash is picked up once a week (like most people's), and I experimented with these by emptying my cat's litter box (we use feline pine) in a bio bag. The litter had to sit 5 days before pick up, and I even kept the bag in a cool place. Wrong. The bag broke down and I had the unfortunate task of double bagging (that's where these bags would become outrageously unaffordable). Next, I changed my cat box changing schedule so that I would empty it on trash day (this experiment was in July). Still no good. My trash collectors come in the mid afternoon and the bag didn't make it through the hot humid day. From my experiments (at least in the summer months), I could not use these bags individually for feline pine cat litter. Next, I used these bags for my diaper pail (still summer). I only have one toddler (almost 2) in diapers, and I found that the bag is fine if it is used for diapers (no wipes in the pail) and taken out weekly (which gets only halfway full in 7 days), but if I waited until I filled my diaper pail (which takes about 2 weeks), too much moisture got built up in the pail and the bag dissolved. Most people don't want stinky diapers kicking it in the house for 2 weeks, but it's unfortunate to use these expensive bags to half capacity, so either way, you lose. Finally, I found a use for these bags, and that was as my main kitchen bag; but, you have to make significant changes in the way you throw out trash. First off, I read up on these bags, and a previous reviewer stated that if you put your wet trash in, say, an empty bread bag you were going to discard anyway, that these bags will work. I had saved a bunch of these kinds of bags for my cat's litter, so that's how I made these bio bags work. I'd line my can with the bio bag, and on top of the closed can, I'd have an old bagel bag or deli lunch meat ziplock as my wet trash reserve, and if I came up on wet trash I'd put it in that bag, then once that filled up I put the bag of wet trash in the bio bag. As long as the trash didn't get too heavy (or wet), my biobags would make it through a week. If you put wet trash (kitchen scraps, baby wipes, etc) in a biobag, you're doomed. From my experience using the biobags, they really make you cognizant of how you throw things away. Sure, it seems pointless to put your trash in a bunch of basically plastic bags to put it in another bag, but at least you are taking one layer of plastic out of the equation. Every plastic bag I used to hold wet trash was going to be in my trash, anyway. You'd be surprised how many odd plastic bags you throw away (bread bags, empty chip bags, empty cereal bags, etc). It also showed me just how much wet, compostable garbage I make (kitchen scraps), and it proved to me how I really make enough fruit and veggie scraps for composting. But on the other hand, biobags turned me into a total neurotic over my trash can, as I played trash police with my family and friends. If you can get everyone around you to get with the ""system,"" these bags will work for you. For me, honestly, it wasn't worth all the trouble. I am still sticking with my seventh generation trash bags. :( …",22 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Delicious but Not Optimal for Diabetics,4,"I picked up Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Raw Blue Agave recently because it was on sale at a local health food store. I had already made up my mind, after scouting my local stores to no avail, to purchase the Volcanic Nectar brand online but decided to give this a shot because Volcanic Nectar only has one option available (midway in color between Wholesome Sweeteners' lighter option and this one), whereas this looked like a nice alternative for a dark, ""amber"" variety; claims to be both raw and blue; and was displayed right in front of me (I was already primed to buy blue agave nectar, so what the heck...I wanted to believe). I was very pleased when Wholesome Sweeteners returned Sucanat to its wholesome, hand-made/minimally processed origins and so felt confident buying this product because they take their sweeteners and their organic/Fair Trade status very seriously (despite the strong case for Volcanic Nectar on their site, including their claim that color in blue agave nectar, unlike maple syrup or honey, is immaterial). This is a delicious sweetener--very versatile, with many possible uses, and which can often be substituted for honey in recipes (be careful though, because certain of its properties are quite different; also be aware that fructose is the predominant simple sugar in agave's profile and that its fruity taste might not complement certain foods); the price is usually fairly low, too for agave nectar. However, Volcanic Nectar--which owns its manufacturing facility--really does produce the only PURE blue agave nectar for sale in the US and the ONLY one that displays Diabetic Friendly certification by the Glycemic Research Institute--THE ONLY AGENCY OF ITS TYPE RECOGNIZED BY THE FDA AND FTC--on its product label. I was able to determine by the glucose level--28%--indicated for Wholesome Sweeteners on their Web site which producer (I thought Nekutli but it was pointed out to me that IIDEA is right on the label) processes their agave products and indeed, it has additives (despite claims on their Web site and toll-free calls to customer service to the contrary--this apparently has to do with Mexico's somewhat cavalier labeling laws). A chemical analysis of pure blue agave nectar should list ONLY fructose, glucose, and inulin--any other sugars in the profile indicate additives that are potentially harmful to diabetics/hypoglycemics. This is a delicious product but is not certified safe for diabetics. Wholesome Sweeteners' site claims a GI of ""39 or less,"" which is much higher than that of Volcanic Nectar; these figures are still below the &lt;55 determined to be safe for diabetics, but their nutritional profile also indicates the presence of other sugars. For diabetics looking for safe, alternative, natural sweeteners, Volcanic Nectar, with its incredibly low GI of 27 and no additives of any kind, is the blue agave nectar of choice (it, too, is delicious although much fruitier than Wholesome Sweeteners, and their FAQ claim processing at a low enough temperature to qualify as ""raw"" ). The bottom line: if you have no blood sugar problems and want an alternative sweetener that tastes good and isn't too expensive, this is fine. I like its darker, less fruity flavor, but I'll be sticking with Volacanic Nectar when the bottle's empty. And for the record, I have no professional/personal connection with either of the firms cited in this review; I'm just a consumer who assumes that, like me, people want the ammunition required for making informed decisions. …",68 out of 73 users found this review helpful

 Still Amazing!!!,5,"I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet. The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch. With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now. My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you. Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that. I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra. It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge. Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me. And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant. ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!! Cheers!!!! P.S. ZICO is still amazing. …",13 out of 24 users found this review helpful

It tastes great and is good for you. Chia absorbs 10 times it's volume in water and can be dehydrating if you don't consume it with enough water. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Clarification,5,"Please note, Superstore did not incorrectly place this item in the ""foods"" section: This is not just a mustard-flavored, or mustard-scented oil--it's actually the oil from mustard seeds, which have been safely consumed by people in India for thousands of years. The reason the label reads ""for external use only"" is due to an FDA regulation: When the product is sold in the US, it must legally bear this label. This is exactly the same thing that has been used extensively in northern India for cooking for ages. This very product (""KTC Pure Mustard Oil"") is sold in many Indian groceries in the U.S., and everyone there will tell you that it's used for a cooking oil. If you look on the back of the bottle you will see in the labeling ""Manufactured by: KTC (Edibles) LTD."" Mustard oil is actually reputed to be particularly heart-healthy, and have a lower percentage of saturated fats than canola or other edible oil. One note, it's always briefly heated to a very hot (almost smoking) point by Indian cooks right before using. This is done to get rid of a raw taste that is considered not pleasant, and to achieve a nice mellow flavor. Hope this info helps. …",59 out of 59 users found this review helpful
 Smoke me a bowl...of tea,5,"I first heard about Lapsang Souchong while reading Story of Tea: A Cultural History and Drinking Guide , where they described the history and manufacturing process for the unique tea, as well as saying that it's strong smoky flavor had a ""love it or hate it"" reputation amongst tea drinkers. Well, my favorite beverage in the world is the Islay whisky Laphroaig, and I have heard those exact same terms used to describe its flavor many, many times. I knew I had to give Lapsang Souchong a try. Of course, there are many Lapsang Souchong's available, and it was really just a gamble to decide which one to chose. I wanted a loose-leaf tea, since they tend to be of superior quality to tea bags. I had heard the of Harrogate Lapsang Souchong Loose Leaf described as a ""beginner's Lapsang Souchong,"" with a less-intense smokiness and I knew I didn't want that. If ""less-intense"" was what my palette demanded I wouldn't reach for a bottle of Laphroaig! Another reviewer recommended this China Mist product (sold under the name of their imprint company ""Leaves Pure Tea"") as being a good example of Lapsang Souchong. The price and quantity were just right so this is what I picked. I am extraordinarily pleased with this purchase, and now am a dedicated fan of Lapsang Souchong. The aroma is an intense smokiness, although the flavor is much more delicate. I went with the recommended steeping time of five minutes in under-boiled water, and that seemed just about right. If this tea is ""love it or hate it,"" I definitely fall into the ""love it"" category. The tea comes packed in an air-tight package with an oxygen-eater insert so it is as fresh as modern technology can make it. The zip-lock bag is re-sealable, which is nice. I can't find any details on the grade of the tea, or where is was processed but I assume for the price we are not dealing with a top-quality first-flush product, but for something that has been smoked over pinewood for so long you don't really need the most delicate leaves! Aside from enjoying a glass of Lapsang Souchong, it is really wonderful for cooking. ""The Story of Tea"" has a Lapsang Souchong ice cream recipe that I want to try out, and I recently used some in a soup I was making as a replacement for liquid smoke. It turned out fantastic, with the tea lending a complex smokiness to the dish. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 My personal fave,5,"My husband gave me a Keurig coffee maker, so we've been trying different flavors of coffee. To me, I don't care about brand necessarily, I just like flavored coffee. On the top of my list are Gloria Jean's assorted flavors (Hazelnut, French Vanilla, White Chocolate -- I think). That one also includes a Mudslide flavor, but we thought it had a slight coconut taste we didn't care for. I like the Kahlua brand Kahlua coffee, but the flavor portion is a little strong. But my VERY, VERY, VERY favorite flavor is this Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle flavor. It's just the right balance of ""coffee"" to ""flavor"" ratio. You can taste it, but still taste the coffee. And my kitchen smells heavenly! But a lot of it boils down to personal taste and preferences. If you typically like this type of flavored coffee, you will love this flavor. And I definitely recommend Subscribe and Save for K-cups if you have a Keurig. It's the most economical way to get them. You get a discount and free shipping. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Best thing since Sliced Bread....Awesome !!!,5,"I am not a big fan of fruit roll-ups as they tend to be more like candy than fruit with added sugar.

I love them all although the sour apple is indeed ""sour"". It will make your mouth pucker which I personally love but I buy the strawberry & tropical flavors for my children.

 Good saffron for an great price,5,"There's really not much else to say about this - it's an incredible deal when compared to normal retail prices for saffron. The saffron is good quality and noticeably fresh (the use-by date on mine was three years away) and it's a fraction of the usual cost. One thing I particularly liked and that isn't made clear by the description is that this product is actually five one-gram boxes and not one five-gram box, so the saffron in the boxes you haven't opened yet will stay fresh longer. Still, if you only use saffron every once in a while you'd be better off buying a smaller quantity even if you pay a little more by weight; this is a considerable amount of saffron. I cook with it regularly so it's great for me, I'm very pleased with this purchase. …",31 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 Watch That Shelf Life!,3,"As the description notes, balsamic does indeed ""growth"" more valuable as it ages. What the review fails to note is that unlike fine wine, it also grows ever more alcoholic. One nip of this stuff, and you'll be unfit to drive for hours. To put it simply? It will mess. you. up. If you know that going in, you may be able to withstand the effects of this heady brew. Do take note of the product's two year shelf life, however. After two years, enough oxygen will undoubtedly have penetrated to turn this vinegar into wine. Not a good wine, not a fine aged wine, but a blend in the vein of Two Buck Chuck. In short, use it sparingly but use it quickly, then buy some more. It's slightly cheaper than just burning your money! …",8 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Great Coffee - But don't buy it here.,1,"The coffee is rich and delicious... a great way to start the day or to end an evening meal. But at $1.00 a cup it is way overpriced. I bought my Nespresso coffee machine from an Superstore dealer. The price was very good. So I assumed that the cost of the coffee would be good as well. I performed a Google internet search for the lowest prices on Nespresso coffee, and all search results linked to Superstore. So I ordered 50 cups and paid $1.00 a cup. Then, a few days later I found that I could order the same coffee directly from the Nespresso website for only $0.60 a cup. This shows you how skewed the Google Search Engine is and also reveals that the ""deals"" on Superstore are not always good deals. Lessons learned: 1) The coffee is great! 2) Do not trust Google as a reliable source to point you in the direction YOU want to go in. It only points you in the direction they want to take you in. 3) Buy your coffee directly from Nespresso and save 40% (and get faster shipping as well.) 4) Do not rely on Superstore for the best deals. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Great Product In Wrong Container,5,"Undoubtedly, the purchase and use of stool softeners would plummet if everyone, including physicians, considered magnesium. Fact: An insufficient amount of magnesium in the body is a primary cause of constipation and hemorrhoids, yet most physicians unwittingly recommend stool softeners. Fact: By taking your measure of Natural CALM daily your constipation will quickly subside. Friends, before you devour any more medications why not try a natural remedy? Natural CALM is an easy-to-assimilate powder that when mixed with water becomes effervescent. More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM. Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars. Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage. Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: ""Place powder in a glass or mug,"" it says. ""Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water."" Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide. Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy. Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch. Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors? No fructose added. For further information call customer service at (866) 416-9216. Take charge of your health. Live life to the fullest. …",17 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Smells Great; Makes Things Taste Great,5,"Several years ago, I started making homemade marshmallows for family and friends. You'd be amazed at the simple joy that radiates from the face of a person learning for the first time that marshmallows can be made at home. Anyway, as a special treat for a friend who is so enamored with France that she grows French lavender in her backyard because it reminds her of her travels there, I decided to try a lavender marshmallow. I was able to find some culinary lavender in my local grocery store (near a pretty urban area), but it seemed so expensive. In the end, this is about a fifth of the price of my grocery store. Win! When I got the package in the mail, I could smell the floral, almost woodsy and astringent fragrance that I associate with lavender (and rosemary) before even opening it. The color of the flower buds ranged from shades of blue to purple. To cook with it, I dump what I need into a large bowl and use the sprayer on my faucet to put enough water in the bowl so that the flowers float. I give it a stir and then use a small-gauge strainer to scrape the floating flowers out of the water. Any detritus that may be mixed in with the flowers will sink to the bottom (though any stems will not - but then again, rosemary and thyme typically have some stems mixed in), so don't just dump it in the strainer. Glean the flowers from the top of the bowl. As for my marshmallows, which I topped with lavender-scented dark chocolate, my friend loved them and everything I've made since (lavender lemon cookies, blueberry lavender syrup, lavender cream, lavender, thyme, and rosemary roasted potatoes, lavender butter, strawberry lavender butter, etc.) has been quite delicious. When I need more lavender, I know where to come. Update: I also wanted to mention that 1 oz. of lavender is about 1.25 cups. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful

How on earth can anyone give this stuff more than one star? The serving size listed on the box is 1/2 cup. First of all, who eats 1/2 cup of cereal? I doubled up on the serving, and poured a full cup in the bowl... added some 2% organic milk..... yummmm! Wrong! Now I know why the serving size is specified at 1/2 cup..... anybody that can gag down more than a half cup of this stuff in one sitting, is a better man than I am. Seriously.... what possible reason could anyone have for eating this stuff? I tried my best to choke down this stuff, but the more I ate, the worse the experience became. About a third of the way through, I cried uncle and dumped the remaining meal in the trash. There may be a use for this cereal, but eating it, is not a viable option.

" Some cans tastes good, others horrid",3,"I really do not know what the issue is with this goat milk. My one year old daughter has suffered horrible constipation since switching to cow milk on her birthday. After a month of us both suffering (because I had to help it along if you get my drift), I switched her to goat milk. After 2 days, she was passing perfectly soft stools. The goat milk definitely cured her of the constipation, but each can I open seems to be different. Sometimes when I reconsitute it, I know right away that it is going to taste terrible because the smell is so strong. Other cans, I hardly notice it. She will not drink the bad-smelling milk, and when I have tried it, I have nearly vomitted! Majorly salty and gamey tasting. Compared to fresh (Meyenberg from the fridge section of grocery store), well, it really doesn't compare. I have found the fresh to taste sweet, like cream, and then there is a little gamey after-taste, but nothing like the slap-you-in-the-face taste of the powdered. I was hoping to save money with the powdered, but since it is a 50/50 chance she won't drink certain cans, I am really wasting money. I am thinking I will have to stick with the fresh from now on. If anyone has any ideas about what the difference between cans could be, I would love to hear it! I always have prepared it with Britta-filtered water (warmed on the stove) and mixed it up in pyrex, then stored it in a large Ball jar in fridge.

 Perfect for a home theatre popper,5,"I love this popcorn, and with the subscription savings of 15% and free shipping that you get on subscription products, this stuff is a bargain. I used to use th 4oz kits with my Whirley Pop and it made delicious popcorn every time. I moved to the 8oz bags when my Matinee Movie 8oz popper arrived from Discount Tommy. The 8oz bags have nearly twice the yield of the 4 oz kits and are less than 4 dollars a case more (Thats only .16 more a kit for double the batch) My 8oz popper creates a little more old maids because the kettle is designed to spit out the corn on the bottom of the tray as it pops. The 8oz kit is a bit big for home use unless you actually have a commercial style popper. There are very few oil based poppers (electric or stove) that can handle the yield of these kits, and if you have a Whirly Pop or Stir Crazy then I would get the 4oz kits. If you have a commercial style 8oz popper I would totally recommend these. The funny thing is that the 4oz kits have instructions for hot air machines. They say just don't use the oil. Are you kidding me!?!? It's the coconut oil and the butter salt that give this stuff it's ""movie theatre"" taste. Buying this stuff for a hot air machine is just plain dumb.
