" Nice idea, but...",3,"The idea is a good one. Who doesn't want to reminisce about their childhood when they were free and innocent?! But the price is a bit steep and the products aren't that impressive. Many of these items can be found in certain grocery or candy stores, and for a fraction of the price. It would be much more impressive and tantalizing if there were items that you can't find regularly. I would like to see one with old favorites such as dweebs, bonkers, gatorgum or bar none (to name a few). Bring back those and you can charge me any price you want!!! …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Half-empty cans and greasy inconsistent ingredients,1,"We have been feeding this to our dogs for over a year. Over the past few months, we have had a problem with the cases of Grammy's Pot Pie cans. Some cans were full of chunks of fat and a thick lard-like gravy with no veggies, and some cases were fine with chicken and veggies,etc. What happened to truth in labeling? We also had the problem with the cans being only half-full sometimes. Our dogs were getting bad diarhea from the fat in the food so we had to stop giving them Merrick. They need to start testing their food again. It used to be great. Look at the old reviews from last year and before. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Excellent Product & Flavor is Wonderful!!,5,"Bought this popcorn salt looking for an alternative to pouring/dripping butter over freshly popped corn...nothing worse than soggy popcorn. I have always loved the salty/buttery taste of the movie theater popcorn, but couldn't find anything similar until now. This stuff is really delicious! The only complaint I have is that the container cap/lid has the double opening, so that you can choose to just pour it on or choose to sprinkle it over the popcorn. Unfortunately, the sprinkle holes in this cap are huge, so there's no sprinkling the salt around evenly, it just pours out anyways. To remedy this situation, we've purchased an extra salt shaker and just refill it when needed. That way, we can get the popcorn salt sprinkled on evenly without overdoing it. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Let me save you the trouble...,1,"I am looking for ways to increase protein intake--so I jumped on this cereal--and bought four boxes. The minute it was delivered, I poured a big bowl.

 Just plain cool,5,"I bought this because I saw something similar on Iron Chef. You can serve food on it and wipe it with a damp rag for reuse. This shape isn't as usefull as the 8""x8""x1"" but it's still pretty cool. I figure that I'll use them (as in 6 bricks) for a while as serving plates and the recycle them in my mortar and pestle. I've purchased rough-chopped pink salt for more than the per pound price of these bricks. This salt compliments foods like Sushi or Sashimi. I put this in the nice-to-have category. If you have a few dollars extar to spend than get rid of that iodized (cyanide) table salt and switch over to 100% sea salt. If you eat anything that isn't 100% home made, chances are you get enough iodine in prepared foods. Do some research and see how conventional table salt in mined using presurized potassium cyanide - yummy. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" Won't buy again. Product of China, went bad before delivery.",1,Purchased two boxes in the past. Latest order tasted very different and was stale (kind of had a moldy taste but no visible mold). Called Mrs. May's and they said there was nothing they could do about it. These are a product of China and the bars tasted really different like they had bad ingredients or had gone bad. Mrs. May's representative was not concerned and treated me like I was trying to scam them. Great product idea but I won't be buying any of their products in the future.

 New formula - Yuk!,1,"Unbeknownst to me, the new formula was shipped to me. I used to love this stuff. It worked great and tasted palatable. I usually use less powder than what they recommend since I need a lot more water than other people. Now they've used stevia as the sweetening agent and the product is bitter and nasty tasting. It was so bad I thought the batch was off and was going to return it as defective! Then I saw the mention of stevia on the label. Oh...that explains it. That stuff doesn't taste sweet at all. It's worse than old school saccharin. Also they lowered the amount of calcium and changed other ingredients. It sounds like they reformulated to reduce costs. I can't use this rubbish. I want my money back and I'll have to try something else. …",12 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 And now for something different... (and oily),3,"A longtime fan of Nong Shim's excellent and popular spicy Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun and Shim Kimchi Noodle Ramyun , I was curious to try something different. And different it is. This is the first Nong Shim product I didn't take a liking to right away. Chapagetti is ""chajang"" + ""spaghetti"", chajang myun (noodle) being a Korean interpretation of a Chinese dish. Chajang literally means ""fried sauce"". It's a thick, black, soybean paste that's slightly sweet. For the instant version, Nong Shim replaced the paste with a mix-in powder. Inside the bag are 3 flavoring packs: a packet of sauce powder, an oil packet, and a dehydrated vegetables packet. Preparation is easy. Just add the vegetable pack to the noodles when cooking, drain, then add the other 2 packets and stir well before eating. The instructions say you need to boil the noodles in a pot for several minutes, but just pouring boiling water on the noodles and letting them rehydrate works just as well. I add the vegetable pack after I've drained the noodles so as not to pour it all out accidentally with the water. The residual heat and moisture will reconstitute the ingredients. The first time I tried this, I added everything. It tasted very oily and the powder seemed to be too much compared to the quantity of noodles. The noodle platform is hearty, thick, and elastic, like Nong Shim is well-known for, but I particularly dislike the oil because it made them greasy and runny. Now, I add half a bag of the powder and discard the oil, saving a few calories along the way and cutting down on some sodium. The tangy taste is very similar to Ippei-chan Instant Yakisoba Noodles and other Japanese instant yakisoba because of the same Chinese culinary influence. Chapagetti contains less than 1/2 the sodium of the regular spicy Nong Shim ramen, so as a quick meal, it's not as bad for you. You can also add cooked cabbage and slices of chicken or other meats to bulk up the meal and make it more filling, as well as improve the nutritional value. Verdict: still a good noodle, but it may not be what some shoppers are expecting. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 The only way to go,5,"This plant food is incredible. It's super-concentrated plant fuel. Whether you have a green thumb or not, I highly recommend Schultz. It's inexpensive and lasts forever (only 7 drops per quart of water). If you tend to notice last-minute that your plants are dying, this stuff will save the plant. It does promote incredible growth, though, so if your plants are healthy and you start using it every time you water, be prepared for that. I've never tried it on outdoor plants (I live in an apartment), but I've heard nothing but good from friends who also use Schultz. Bottom Line: Incredible value, Super-Concentrated, and definitely worth checking out. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Great product overall,4,"Summary: Great (if kind of gross) product for distracting my puppy, but there is a slight choking hazard. My crazy but adorable Boston Terrier is extremely high strung and suffers from separation anxiety. These sticks were recommended to us in order to help distract her while we are away from home. When I first gave her a bully stick, she immediately waltzed off with it and proceeded to find somewhere to ""bury"" it; which was fun because she had never done that before with a treat. Now I find bully sticks in the laundry hamper, under my pillow, between the couch cushions, and other strange places (she once tried to hide one under my arm, which really didn't work out too well for her). When she gets around to chewing on one, she happily munches away. Between the ""hiding"" and the chewing, Chompers is occupied for quite some time. The sticks look really nasty once they have been used for a while, but they don't smell or leave marks on the carpet. Now for the down side: While safer than rawhide, these treats do occasionally choke my dog. The hard stick turns soft and stringy when chewed on for long periods of time. Since the dog can't really bite the stringy stuff off (hard to explain unless you see it), she will try to swallow stringy stuff attached to the remainder of the stick and choke on it when it gets caught in her throat. This is not a problem when I am home because she get my attention when it happens and I can pull the stringy stick parts out of her throat. When we leave the house, we have to make sure all the stringy bits are cut off of her sticks so she won't choke while we are away. I don't know if anyone has had similar problems (please let me know if you have found solutions!!!) but it was a little scary at first to see her choking. I'm not sure if she would be able to resolve the choking situation without our help. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful

" Tasty, but be aware of nutrient content",4,"I like this product. I think it is quite tasty both to drink and over cereal, and I haven't had any problems mixing it (I shake it in a quart mason jar). However, be aware that nutritionally, this ""Vegan Beverage Mix"" is not the same thing as liquid soy milk. For instance, compared to Silk, it is lower in protein (2 g vs. 7 g), higher in carbohydrates (16 g vs. 8 grams), lower in calcium (8% DV vs. 30% DV), and contains no Vitamin D.

 D&A Spice Mill - Garlic At Its Best,5,"If you're like me, often you just don't have the time or forgot to buy some fresh garlic at the store, and pretty much bottled dry garlic just doesn't cut it - I've tried them all! BUT.... that's where D&A Garlic comes in - their spices, Garlic, Salt, Pepper and others, are simply the best possible products is an easy to use grinder container. Yes, you can easily find similar products at the store, but NOT similar taste. Go ahead, try the garlic - heat up some spaghetti in a pot, add butter to coat, and grind on a nice amount of D&A Garlic, stir and let sit for just a minute or two - the fresh and natural flavor, as well as small fresh garlic pieces will astound you (and no tomato needed!) Try adding some fresh garlic to your buttered popcorn, get inventive! The Med. Salt and the Multi-pepper are equally fantastic on your steaks, eggs or other favorite standard fare - add some spice to your life today. These are worth the extra price - you pay for what you get! (and if you want quality, taste, and unmatched excellence - this is it. (I even had some old Garlic that was 3 years past its recommended best use date, and it was still wonderful - better than the other junk I had just bought at the store, which is what prompted my to retry this brand from Italy - made in Florence, with care and pride). …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Healthy Alternative for Working Moms,5,"I give props to any mom, especially one that holds down a full time job or two, that can puree and strain her own food. If that's you, hat's off. You're my hero. I'm no superhero, so my goal was to find the best quality, best tasting food with minimal processing. Let's face it, there are plenty of organic options out there. And these days, I think most of them are good. The little man likes the Gerber organics fruits. They're easy to find and inexpensive. But hands down, the Happy Baby products are the best quality, best tasting (in my opinion) and most convenient of them all. The pouches are great, especially for when we're on the go. We can eat the fruit varieties without even putting on a bib. The Chick Chick is the man's favorite (bib required). The negative is that they're about twice the price of the Gerber fruits and meats. So if you're on a budget, this may be a bit of a stretch. Nonetheless, keep some pouches around for when you travel. Baby will love them! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Nice snack that lasts!,5,"This bar has cranberries, almonds, and macadamia nuts (NOT bits and pieces!) as their main ingredients, in a soft honey-like glaze to keep it all together. I refrigerate them in the summer or they kind of ""wilt"". The ingredients are fresh, and the nuts are crunchy. What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them. Those nuts are meant to be chewed and not inhaled, unlike a lot of snacks that disappear as soon as you get the wrapper off. I can't eat one in front of my favorite dog, as this is one snack I am too fond of to share with her... much to her dismay. I think they are worth the cost, and I know they cost way more if you find them in a local grocery store. …",56 out of 58 users found this review helpful
 Buyers BEWARE!,1,"I placed an order online with Barry Farms on December 29th. Their website stated that orders would be processed and shipped within 48 hours or at most 7 days. After my initial order confirmation, I heard nothing from the company about when my order would be shipped. I emailed them to ask about my order on January 9th and was responded to on January 12th (14 days after my order was placed) stating that one of my items was back-ordered. Their website specifically states that they do not hold orders for back-ordered items. I then called the company and told them I needed the items (with or without the backordered items) no later than January 22nd. They ensured me that it would arrive by then. I received an email on January 18th informing me that my order had shipped without the backordered items and I would be receiving a refund for the missing items. However, the package did not arrive on the 22nd as promised, forcing me to purchase the items elsewhere. I then emailed the merchant and asked for a refund of the shipping charges since they do not accept returns. I was refused, stating that since the error was with UPS, they were not at fault (even though their website says they ship within 7 days, which they did not, and do not hold for back-ordered items, which they did). This is unacceptable behavior from any merchant. I should have been able to return my items for a full refund or at minimum received a refund for the shipping charges.

 Endless uses!  Great product! You gotta try it.,5,"This is the best brand! [[ASIN:B000VUMSE0 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 54 oz]I have been using more and more coconut oil for the past for months. First it was for facial moisturizer than learned how great it is for a whole body moisturizer. Use as you would baby oil.

 extremely deceptive business practice--product made with chemicals not truffles,1,"I am disgusted that they are allowed to get away with tricking people. There is no actual truffle used in this product but they do everything they can to convince you that there is. The ingredients say organic sunflower oil and white truffle extract. Extract makes you think it was extracted from real truffles, doesn't it? Well, it wasn't. The extract is a chemical compound manufactured in a laboratory to mimic the smell of real truffles. How about where it says in the label that ""White truffles originate in Alba, Italy and are considered to many to be the most prestigious truffles""...do you suppose that means white truffles from Italy have anything to do with this concoction? Well, they don't. They might as well have written, ""The sun is so and so many miles away from the earth."" They put that sentence in just to further trick you so you think that you are getting an expensive product with a grand tradition behind it when all you are getting is some cheap oil with some synthetic chemical added to it. They should be ashamed of themselves. Should they be allowed to sell you a synthetic chemical to eat? Maybe. Should they be allowed to market the product to convince customers that they are getting a product made with real truffles? No, they absolutely should not. We have food laws that are supposed to protect customers from this sort of trickery. The FDA has really dropped the ball on this. Update: They are getting even trickier. Their label has now been changed to read truffle extract instead of truffle aroma. I called the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (see section 201 for definitions) has never defined the term extract. I was specifically told this on the phone by an FDA representative. She said because the term extract has not been legally defined by this act, anything can be called an extract. Thus, La Tourangelle can legally get away with calling something a truffle extract even if truffles weren't used to make it. …",22 out of 27 users found this review helpful

 Nutritious and satisfying,5,"This is dense tuna. I love it straight out of the can over salad greens, with a little olive oil, lemon juice, and capers. It is super high in omega-3s and just delicious. I have been eating this for years, and Superstore has a great deal on it. I am a student in a masters program (Physician Assistant) and always have cans of this in my locker for lunch in case I forget something. It has come in handy! It satisfies my hunger for hours because of all the protein and fat. The taste is really strong, but that is what I like. Regarding the metallic taste, I have only tasted a metallic taste once and that was the unsalted variety. I have probably eaten 200 cans of this over the years and have only tasted that once. So I don't think it's a common problem. I think this tuna is for someone who doesn't really want to have to add a bunch of stuff to it to make it palatable/taste good. It's a bit pricy, but well worth it for the convenience and nutritional value. One thing to be cautious of is that if you want to put a lot of stuff in it, this might be a bit too salty for that. I find this pretty salty, but you'd have to judge yourself. I buy both the unsalted and the salted. If I'm making a tuna salad or tuna melts, I use the unsalted and add in salt to taste. Otherwise, I find it's too salty. Straight out of the can, though, the salted is the best way to go. :) …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 This Poison Should Get 0 Stars,1,"By the title, you should get the hint of what this product is all about. First af all, I have fed this Duck and Potato dry food to my dog for 4 years and never had a single issue, in fact she was a heathly vibrant dog with great vitality during that period. I bought 4 large bags about 5 months ago, because I like to keep a nice supply on hand. After I fed her from a freshly opened bag, I was greeted with a **** diarrhea crime scene all over the house at 3:00 in the morning. Actually, it was more blood than stool and I freaked out not knowing what was going on, she was then shaking uncontrollably in discomfort. I took her to the vet and $200 later after all the tests, we found nothing. I put her on a strict chicken and rice formula for a month and she was just fine, so I decided to start feeding her the same Natural Balance again, not knowing it was the food doing it and the same nightmare happened again(**** mucusy stool). Another month of Chicken and rice and no problems. Well, tonight I mixed in literally 15 small pieces of that Duck and Potato with a bunch of rice and chicken and I can already hear her stomach gurgling like it did before. I promply gave her an anti-diarrheal just to be safe, but i'm watching her close and it'll probably be another sleepless night of cleaning up a disaster zone. I just finished reading other reviews tonight on the net about other people having similar problems and it's all because this company changed their formula. I think the ""new"" formula is worse than that tainted malamine food that got in the supply a few years ago. My pet store won't return the bags I have, because I never thought about keeping the receipts from a product I've used for soo many years without problems, now I have to eat another $200 and toss this junk on the garbage. I won't even consider giving it to my neighbors dog, because I'm not the sadistic type. This product should be recalled and it's not healthy for any dog. Even if it seems the dog might not be showing bad symptoms, it can't possibly be good considering what my dog has gone through. Shame on you Mr Patten for cutting corners and you better come out with a formal apology for this mishap. I am using several types of your canned food at the moment(except the duck and potato canned food) and the are no problems this those(yet), but rest assured I've lost faith with the reputation of your company and will move on to other healthier avenues for my dogs dietary needs. …",13 out of 18 users found this review helpful

My only issue is that I paid CoffeeAM for this item, listed as ""Tazo Chai Latte Concentrate"" and when it arrived, found that it is NOT actually Concentrate - it's just the normal Tazo Chai Latte. This changes the purchase in my mind dramatically - the cost per volume just went up.

 Natural Sweetener,5,"Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar, this item caught my attention when I read it was an ingredient in ""Xylichew"" chewing gums. Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day. It is commercially manufactured from ""xylan hemicellulose"" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. This ""NOW"" Xylitol is actually made from a corn source. Xylitol actually has been proven to: Reduce Tooth Decay Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel Xylitol is believed to be safe, but doses higher than 30 g per day can cause stomach discomfort. To sweeten one cup of tea, you may need as much as 3 teaspoons which is 12 grams. This would equal 30 calories and 12 grams of Carbohydrates. Each teaspoon contains: Total Fat 0g Sugars 0g Sugar Alcohol 4g Sodium 0mg Protein 0g ""Now"" Xylitol is 100% Pure Xylitol Powder. This product resembles sugar and has a third fewer calories than table sugar. It is a good alternative for diabetics and can be used as a sugar substitute in recipes. Calculate how much each serving will contain to make sure you can use this ingredient in your recipes. When compared to the SoooLite! NoCarbs Blend, this product does have Carbohydrates and more Calories. If you are looking for a No Carbs blend sweetner, NuNaturals SoooLite! Is perfect for tea. It only seems to contain .45 grams of Sugar Alcohol per packet. Both are great sweet alternatives to sugar. If you are tired of the aftertaste of other artificial sweeteners, give these products a try. ~The Rebecca Review …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Well priced through Superstore,5,"I have been purchasing these treats at the recommendation of the vet to help with my cat's tarter build ups. When they are chewed they release enzymes into kitty's mouth to help fight against the tarter. What really surprised me is the price difference, I was paying about $12 at the vet for a 30 pack. When I did the math on buying the 90 pack + S&H, it's about the same amount I would pay for two 30 packs -- so I got 30 more, another month's supply! Also, Entirely Pets shipped this very promptly.

 Vanilla Paste is terrific,4,"Based on recommendation from King Arthur Flour (KAF), I bought the vanilla bean paste. It came in quickly. I tried it and came to several conclusions. First, the flavor is outstanding..rich vanilla flavor. As described at KAF, the paste contained small vanillla bean specks which were visible in the lighter colored preps I made, like French Vanilla ice cream. It gave the preparations a special touch. One caution. If used in a thin batter, the specks will sink to the bottom. I learned this when I made Creme Brulee. The vanilla flavor was great, but at the bottom of the ramekin were all the bean specks. Use the paste in recipes where the specks will stay suspended and not sink. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" Holy SALT, Batman!",2,"We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a ""healthier"" alternative to regular chips. I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip. The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor. The big issue with these is the sodium level. After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt. A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like. I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%. Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a ""healthy"" alternative to chips. …",45 out of 52 users found this review helpful

 Awesome for Blowing Bubbles,5,"There are so many different kinds of bubble gum on the market today that I would be clueless as to how to list them all. On the other hand, with a bubble gum such as Dubble Bubble, who cares? Dubble Bubble has a long and glorious history. The gum traces its history back to a bubble gum called Blibber-Blubber developed by Frank Fleer in 1906. That gum was never marketed. Other people at Fleer's company continued to work on the bubble gum, with the formula finished by 1928. Perhaps the biggest change from the original Dubble Bubble to today's Dubble Bubble are the variations in flavor. Double Bubble retains the original flavor along with a variety of other flavors, though the flavors are relatively mild. Dubble Bubble has two features that make it one of the superior bubble gums. First, the gum gets softer as you chew it (more on that in a moment). Second, the gum makes excellent bubbles. I like the fact that the gum gets softer as you chew it, though it can be quite hard initially. There are other brands that begin soft, but seem to get chewier and stiffer the longer you chew it. I suppose the goal with those brands is to chew the flavor out and then toss the gum. However, with Dubble Bubble you can chew the gum for a long time and the gum remains soft. I have made bubbles with Double Bubble gum a long time after I started chewing the gum. Thus, the gum maintains its softness as well as its cohesiveness for making bubbles. For even larger bubbles you can add a second gumball once the first one has been chewed for a while. However, I recommend you abstain from a third gumball; the size of the gum becomes cumbersome at that point. In spite of the huge array of bubble gums on the market today, I continue to choose Dubble Bubble Gumballs as one of my favorites. I suspect that I always will. Enjoy! …",13 out of 18 users found this review helpful

Rather than making additional enquiries I decided to ""move on"" -- perhaps I'd understand when I opened the package that ""dark"" was assumed and was, accordingly, not stated on the package. I was disappointed in the pale color of the product and even more so by the lack of intensity of the flavor -- nothing ""dark"" about it. If you are one to buy bar chocolate with a 65%+ cacao flavor, you'll probably be disappointed. Otherwise , I guess that it is a respectable product.

" Great ""wheat berries"", i.e. whole kernel wheat",5,"I recently received a Vitamix Blender, and have been experimenting with using it to grind my own flour at home. Once you have tried *real* whole grain flour, you will never go back! The pricing of this 25 pound bag, with delivery, is better than I have been able to find anywhere, and the grains make a great, strong whole-grain flour. Note that this is not flour, but actual wheat seeds (often referred to as ""wheat berries""). In addition, the grains are fertile, meaning that you can use them to make sprouted grain. Or if you are a survivalist, you can plant the grains and actually grow a crop! Another main advantage of whole grain is its shelf life. There are reports that 2000 year old grain has been found and germinated! In any case, if properly stored, you can expect a 5-10 year shelf life from whole grain, as opposed to a much shorter shelf life with flour. I purchsed a 5-gallon bucket with a ""gamma 2"" lid for storing the grain, and I'm confident that it will keep nicely fresh for a long time to come. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on,5,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups. I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive. I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products. If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :) EcoBrew VS Solofill First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew. Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker. These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable! I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product. The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly. …",559 out of 562 users found this review helpful
 The price is right,5,"We have a little Maltese that we spoil to no end. These treats are the perfect size for him and he loves them. He can be a little picky. Among his daily treats are Greenies and since we found these on Superstore, Zuke's Jerky Naturals. I will say that we tried two different kinds. Along with these, we tried the WellBites Chicken and Venison Recipe Dog Treats, 8-Ounce Pouch . The Zuke's are really potent. When you open the bag, you catch a big whiff of how strong they are. They're probably real flavorful because of it (I didn't try one). The Wellness treats seem a little dryer. While our little guy likes both of the treats, the Zuke's win over the Wellness. Plus they're cheaper so that's even better. He can't get enough of them. We also tried the Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch made by Zuke's. He doesn't like those as much as the Greenies. I would say that this product is one of the best we found for our dog. Plus we were able to take advantage of the free super saver shipping as well. These are highly recommended. [Edit: August 14, 2011] He still loves them! We've had to start giving our little guy Remedel for a little shoulder injury he had. These Zukes make it real easy to give him the pill. Since they're moist, we just put the pill inside and press it all around the pill. That way he doesn't even know he's taking it. Trying to give him pills with the Wellness treats doesn't work so well since they're dryer. [Edit: September 29, 2012] Anyone else notice that they seem different?? The last couple packs we bought were dryer and brittle. They also weren't as potent as the other ones were. He doesn't seem to like them as much any more.

We have had problems with blockages & constipation as a result -- everytime she has received a rawhide. We have a 13 yr old Beagle which was introduced to Greenies about 2 yrs ago. We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try. Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes. When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat. We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water. After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity. In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).

Anyway, we started supplementing his food with Newman's Own and I swear the cat looks 2 years younger. He is more active, his eyes have cleared up, and he has lost weight. The vet is amazed as well, as his sugar levels are better. I am not suggesting anyone use this food as a replacement for what a Vet has suggested. But if you have an animal who is not responding well, it is worth a try to add this product to their diet. …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Best haggis I've had in the US,5,Back home in Scotland I ate haggis at least twice a week and it's been a major craving for the 8 months I've lived in the US. This isn't that similar to tinned haggis in Scotland; mainly the texture of tinned haggis back home is finer and drier than this...but it is fairly close to the 'real' haggis in a skin and is spiced just perfectly. I think preparation counts for a lot with this haggis and I dry fry it in a pan whilst stirring it until it just starts to brown as I think that improves the texture. All in all it's great with a baked potato or just for fellow Scots missing a taste of home. If you haven't tried haggis then this is a great example of how good it is...and it really is like nothing else! …,36 out of 36 users found this review helpful
 Amaranth popcorn,5,"I purchased Amaranth because of the health benefits. Unlike the majority of people who use this in place of rice or in baking, I purchased it to make popcorn and it's yummy. Make sure you do NOT use a non stick pan. Make sure it is very HOT before placing 1 TBS of Amaranth in the pan. If it doesn't pop immediately your pan isn't hot enough. Immediately remove your pan from the stove and shake shake shake so it doesn't burn. Very tasty treat.

 Comparing Kraft's 'Deluxe' mac & cheese dinners,4,"Superstore sells four Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe dinners. They're all pretty good. Each uses packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder, so the cheese is never clumpy and distributes itself evenly. My husband, teenage daughter and I cooked up all four and did our own taste test. Here's what we found: This one, the Original Cheddar flavor, is good. Plenty creamy, it tastes like a homemade version of the Kraft standard (i.e., Macaroni & Cheese Scooby Doo Shapes, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24) ). The Sharp Cheddar flavor ( Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, Sharp Cheddar, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) ) is slightly tastier, and has a subtle smoky aftertaste. The light meal (Kraft Deluxe Macaroni & Cheese Dinner - Light, 14 oz) is pretty good, ut when you try it side by side with the original flavor you can tell it's not as rich. Still, if you only buy this one you'll be happy. If you're counting calories go for it. The Four Cheese meal ( Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, Four Cheese Sauce, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) ) is, in our opinion, the best. With the most cheese flavor, it combines American, cheddar, colby and parmesan, and tastes similar to what you'd find at a decent restaurant. The parmesan flavor is especially noticeable. These Deluxe dinners cost about twice as much as the basic Kraft boxes, but in each case you can really taste the difference. …",13 out of 16 users found this review helpful

" When they're good, they're great, but they're not always good.",3,"I've ordered these olives on 5 different occasions. They'd become a favorite snack. However, two of these 5 times, they arrived in a rather poor state: the olives were perhaps cured too long or stored too long or something, as they were quite mushy - even the normally firm, green ones. There are apparently no returns on these, so sadly I'm having to rethink whether I want to continue ordering them. When they arrive in a good state, they're excellent, and the price beats any other olives of remotely similar quality I've seen in stores or elsewhere on the web. But when they arrive mushy, it's kind of hard to eat them - the normally firm ones have the consistency of an overripe pear, and the normally-firm and normally-soft ones taste a little more acidic than I think they probably should. …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful
" ""Tres intense"" K-cup blend stronger than the usual fare",4,"Dark Magic is for coffee drinkers searching for something bolder than the breakfast blends and flavored coffees ubiquitous on supermarket shelves. Whether it will satisfy depends on what you normally buy at coffee shops. My wife favors a latte or mocha, so she found Dark Magic too strong. I prefer an Americano, so I liked this roast. I tested the Dark Magic blend on Keurig's small cup (5.25 oz) setting to capture the strongest flavor. It was a nice improvement from Green Mountain's Trade Gingerbread I drank earlier in the week. Dark Magic is bolder than Coffee Kona Blend or Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend but no more bitter. If you need more caffeine, I recommend you add a Caffeinated Black Coffee Shot . In summary, I like ""tres intense"" roasts and Mountain Coffee Dark Magic is the darkest I have found in the Keurig lineup. I will post an update should I try a stronger blend than Dark Magic.

 Great Green Tea and Great Company!,5,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family. I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine. After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals. Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide. I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others. Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me. I think it tastes great for a decaff tea. It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste. I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" A tasty, radioactive-orange colored condiment",5,"""A perfect finishing touch for your, tacos, Mexican salads, and sandwich wraps."" - from the label The Food Police will undoubtedly squeal when confronted by Taco Bell's ""Home Originals"" BOLD & CREAMY CHIPOTLE SAUCE. Is the home not sacred? Do the fast-food purveyors of unhealthy meals have to invade Man's last refuge? That provocation in itself makes the condiment endearing to me in addition to the fact that it's a striking radioactive-orange color (especially after being dispensed from the plastic squeeze bottle that will probably persist in a landfill until the Sun goes supernova - another endearing goad of the politically correct). For the chipotle experience, I've heretofore relied on Sandwich Shop Mayo Chipotle, 12-Ounce Squeeze Bottles (Pack of 6) ). Compared to this, the Taco Bell offering has a bit more intense smoky chipotle bite to it, and there's an undertone of cheese to the flavor perhaps imparted by the dried buttermilk in the ingredients. In any case, I've so far tried this sauce on chicken, beef, cheese sandwiches, eggs, and tater tots and licked drips off my fingers. To the extent used, I prefer it to the Kraft product and would preferentially buy it. Nutritionally, this product contains (per 2 Tbsp serving) 110 calories, 11g total fat, 1.5g saturated fat, and 300mg sodium - all of which means that my health and nutrition-conscious wife will likely leave it all for me; I won't have to share. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Rabbits be good medicine,5,"Listen, it all happened a few years ago. I felt pretty good the night before, but when I awoke I had shooting pains in my left hip extending to my testicle. Well, I went to the Doctor and as all regular doctors do, he pretty much told me to take an Advil and get back to him. Well, not only didn't it help, but he billed my insurance over $400! After extensive google searches, I decided to check out a Chinese traditional physician, and after checking out my Chi flow and other such things I won't bother you with, he wrote some scribble on a note (it was Chinese) and when I asked him what it meant, he said ""RABBIT! You eat!"". Aha! Perhaps this was the cure I was looking for, and decided to procure one. Needless to say, Pet stores were pretty horrified at my request of ""One medicinal rabbit"", and sent me on my way. The next thing I tried was going out in the woods to hunt a rabbit. But let me tell you, they are pretty FAST! After trying many methods, such as a home-made spear, rocks, and just trying to chase it through the woods, not only did I not catch a rabbit, my Left hip and testicle hurt more than ever! Finally, I found this rabbit on Superstore, and despite it being more expensive than Kobe Beef, I decided, ""What the Heck!"" and ordered it up. When it arrived, it did not look very appetizing, but I cooked it up in something called ""Hassenpfeffer"" and when I told my roomate, he just said, ""Whatever floats your boat, dude...carry on."" I ate my rabbit while watching an old rerun of ""Man versus wild"" and went to bed with a full stomach but not much hope that rabbit meat would cure me. However, within just a few days, my hip and testicle were as good as new, and I will never question Chinese medicine again.

 Consistent and very high quality,5,"Illy espresso beans are my favorite of all the widely available commercially produced roasted espresso beans. This is the standard medium roast that Illy produces and it is a bit less aggressive and milder tasting than the dark roasts of Lavazza (the other major Italian brand that some people favor). When properly ground, tamped, and brewed Illy espresso has a delightful aroma and flavor, unmatched by any of the other brands. Granted, Illy is quite pricey, and I do not use it all the time for this reason. However, you get what you pay for. Usually, I buy my espresso from a small roasting house in the Midwest that produces a decent medium roast substitute that I do not mind using most of the time. But Illy definitely produces a higher quality bean. One way to judge the quality of roasted espresso beans even before you taste the coffee that they will produce is to look at the evenness of color and size of the beans. The reason is that beans of a uniform size tend to roast more evenly than beans of varying sizes. Moreover, even when the beans are of a uniform size, it is important that they be roasted in small batches and churned during the the entire roasting process to ensure that they all get roasted to the same point. This is why most high quality coffee is roasted in small batches in a rotating drum that roasts all the beans to the exact same point. Moreover, since the moisture content of the beans varies a bit from batch to batch, quality control in the roasting process is extremely important. And it is here that Illy is unmatched. Just do a simple visual comparison of the color and consisteny of Illy beans when compared to any of the other widely available brands and you can easily see why Illy is the best. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Gold Label Coconut Oil,5,"This Gold Label coconut oil has a unique taste. Every other organic or natural coconut oil I've tried has a very light, clean taste of coconut with maybe a little sweetness to it. This Gold Label type has a stronger taste, and not one I associate with fresh coconut. It's OK for cooking meat or vegetables, but I would not use it for any foods where I wanted a sweet taste (like on a sweet potato or in a fruit pie). I'm kind of baffled by the Superstore reviews of this oil in the 32 oz size which say it's bland and doesn't have as much taste as other coconut oils. Less coconut taste maybe, but overall the flavor is stronger. To me anyway. It's possible that since the product is hand made, the flavor may not be consistent between batches. I'm on my second jar and the first jar was so strong I thought there might be something wrong with it. Gold Label Coconut Oil is made by a very unique process. Most other brands of organic coconut oil I've used have been cold expeller pressed in a machine that squeezes the oil from the coconut while controlling the temperature so it doesn't heat up and ""cook"" the oil. The Gold Label coconut oil is made by hand. From the Tropical Traditions website: ""The fresh coconut meat is shredded (wet milled), and then cold-pressed using the water from inside the coconuts to make coconut milk. The milk is then allowed to sit for about half a day, while the oil naturally separates from the heavier water. The oil is then filtered from the curds (coconut solids)."" More info at the Tropical Traditions website at [...] I give this oil extra credit because it's a unique product -- I don't know of any other coconut oil being sold which is made by hand using traditional methods. But I don't think the flavor will be to everyone's taste. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.

 The worst Yogi Tea flavor,1,"First I have to say that I love Yogi tea. I love the messages on the tea bags and some flavors are remarkable! This one, however, is horrible. I guess if you love licorice root you will like it, but I do not. I tolerate the licorice flavor in the CALM Yogi tea because it really calms me before bed and makes me feel like I am floating on a cloud, but it still manages to taste good whereas this one does not. Please do buy Yogi tea and get the Green Tea Slim Life instead- terrific taste, which tastes like green tea with berries in it- a good flavor and not an artificial flavor to it. This Fasting tea has a bitter after taste, which is all licorice root. Stay clear of this flavor but do buy Yogi Tea. I feel transformed by the messages on the tea bags, as it is; so profound!

 Yummy -- but not what I was expecting,4,"This is a delicious drink, but it is not the refreshing beverage you would expect. The chocolate formulation has added sugar and coconut cream, so it tastes like a dairy-free version of chocolate milk. (It is slightly reminiscent of a Mounds bar.)

" OK, not the wonder food I was hoping for",3,"My cat has renal disease and has been on Hill's k/d dry and canned food for over a year. Recently she was getting picky about eating and not wanting the either type of the canned k/d. Based on the Superstore reviews, I ordered the Hi-Tor Neo Diet hoping that she would love it. At first she did love it (something new/different I think), but now she is very ambivalent towards it and lately has preferred the k/d. Perhaps it is due simply to her personality or perhaps it is due to her stage of renal disease, but I have not seen any difference between k/d and the Hi-Tor Neo. Other than the renal disease, she doesn't have any health issues and is still pretty frisky for being 16 years old. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Worst taste ever,1,I purchased these snacks because I had read they were healthy and the reviewers here said they tasted very good. I was excited when I got them and took them to work for part of my lunch the next day. They smelled very fishy when I opened the package but I thought perhaps they would taste good despite the smell. So not. These taste awful. They tasted like fish and not in a good way. I think this must be what the bottom of a river tastes like. I had several of my co-workers try them in case it was just my taste. They all told me they tasted terrible and were surprised that I had bought them. One girl even spit her bite out into a tissue. I do not recommend these. …,10 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 The Six pack! Perfect for the Home Bar,5,"I have tried several of Fee Brother's Bitters and I am ordering the rest of them today. The Orange and Peach Bitters are the finest there is. I might be one of the few people that has actually compared different brands of bitters. If you want to have a complete battery of bitters for mixing drinks at home or at a bar, you need: Orange Bitters Peach Bitters Lemon Bitters Old Fashioned (Angostura-type) Bitters Peychaud's Bitters Jaegermeister Campari Unicum I have used Fee's Brothers at my bar for over ten years, and you can't get some of these anywhere else in the world, if you like mixed drinks, you'll need to buy several of these from Fee Brother's, the complete 8 pack is great. The Old Fashioned Bitters you can get lots of places, and Angostura is quite good, but Fee Brothers is every bit as good. Fee Brother's Orange Bitters is far better than Angostura's Orange Bitters, so I think this set is the quintessential set you'll need. Go ahead, try to find peach or cherry bitters from another company. Get some Peychaud's and a few others and you're good to go. The idea of rhubarb bitters seems a little strange to me, but I haven't tried it, to be honest, and rhubarb might be a little overkill, so this six pack might be perfect for lemon, orange, peach and cherry bitters. Grapefruit sounds great, look forward to trying it. …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Blend it yourself is better!,5,"Its great to be able to blend your own chicory coffee. I use the fresh roasted Sumatra at Costco's with Community Coffee's chicory. My blend is 8oz of chicory to 16oz of coffee. If you want a stronger chicory favor, use more. Use less for a milder blend. The good thing about blending yourself is the ability to use a good grade of coffee. I believe Cafe du Monde uses a low grade of coffee. If you don't need 6 bags of chicory, you can order it directly from Community Coffee. Its $2.99 a bag, plus shipping (at least $6.95) from them. Clearly Superstore is a better value. I will usually end up giving a bag or 2 away to friends or family that express an interest. Storing the rest in the freezer is a good idea. …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Licorice Lovers--You must check this out!,5,"Those of you who love licorice or anise flavor and who happen to be tea-drinkers, rejoice! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic. The anise/licorice flavor is intense. The tea is relatively sweet, so in my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary, but you may want to add a little honey to it.

 Nutty nutrition,5,"Because the grains of teff are small, the bulk of the grain is the bran and germ. This makes teff nutrient dense as the bran and germ are the most nutritious parts of any grain. This grain has a very high calcium content, and contains high levels of phosphorous, iron, copper, aluminum, barium, and thiamin. It is considered to have an excellent amino acid composition, with lysine levels higher than wheat or barley. Teff is high in protein, carbohydrates, and fiber. It contains no gluten so it is appropriate for those with gluten intolerance. It bakes like buckwheat, so it is best to mix it with other, lighter, gluten free flours. I highly recommend it. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

" Arrived fast & healthy, but with broken leaves",4,"The banana plant, along with a Hoya carnosa 'Strawberries and Cream' (rated separately), were ordered together and arrived together just 3 days after ordering, an admirable accomplishment. The only thing that could/should have been done better was in protecting the banana plant's delicate leaves. They were simply suspended in a plastic-foam 'peanuts' that provided very good insulation, but they shifted about in transit resulting in 3 of its 5 leaves to be broken and damaged. I have no doubt that given the plant's overall health otherwise, will recover in a reasonably short amount of time, but is the reason for the 4-star rating. I found the condition acceptable as the plant was ordered for myself, but would not have found it acceptable if the plant was ordered as a gift for someone else. The only other, very minor complaint is that neither plant arrived with a plant tag. In summary, given that both plants were very reasonably priced and arrived quickly and in good-enough health that I would order from them again. I would suggest that if the plants are intended to be gifts that a note to this effect be included with the order. …",29 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 New Recipie: Less servings More Sugar Not recommended (I used to),1,"I'm not a member of the food police. However; I get really mad when a company short changes their customers hoping they will not notice. ESPECIALLY a supposed higher end ""GOURMET"" producer like Ghirardelli! The quick and dirty for those who don't want to read my detailed review. **Is it better than ""Swiss Miss,"" YES. **Did it used to be better before they over-sweetened, cut the # of servings from 20 to 12 and generally ruined a decent product? YES! **Is it over-priced and resting on the Ghirardelli name? OH YES. **Is it a way to impress people who don't know any better albiet for a price? Probably. **Do I still recommend Ghirardelli Hot Chocolates. NOPE Not Any More. (want to know why? read on) For years I have enjoyed the Ghirardelli line of hot chocolates. That is about to change! NOTE: Until this year they have born the subtitle ""Old Fashioned."" That designation has been dropped for reasons which will soon become apparent. They have also quite conspicuously dropped the Product Satisfaction Guarantee along with the Ghirardelli address for applying for reimbursement if you the consumer were dissatisfied. Does this bode well for us? You be the judge and by all means let Ghirardelli know. I cannot include the address due to Superstore review policies. You may however contact them by email at their website. Something I strongly encourage. As a hot chocolate lover I want the original recipie back. I hope after reading my review you will too. What is Ghirardelli doing? Quite simply boosting the sugar levels to astronomical levels and engaging in what I call ""shorting."" Before a serving of any Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix consisted of (3) Tbsp., (22g) yielding twenty, (20) servings per 16oz. can. NOW one serving is (4) Tbsp., (39 grams) yielding only TWELVE (12) servings for the same 16oz. can. This gives us 40 percent LESS servings per can. And at an average of $5.50 per can less s&h an increase from 27.5 cents/serving to 45.8 cents/serving. -- Some may say this is gourmet hot chocolate why quarrel over a few cents. Fair question, but lets be sure were talking about chocolate and not cheap fillers. I have a few cans still left from the ""Old Fashioned"" style which is what Ghirardelli has marketed for years. It IS different and I can taste the difference. However, I will post both Nutrition labels side by side for you to compare and add my analysis at the end. Hopefully the facts will be as clear to you as they are me. NOTE: the nutrition label is a requirement of the USDA. Further they are reprinted everywhere so I am assuming that this is PUBLIC DOMAIN information. (That doesn't mean that Ghirardelli will like me telling you about it.) I will be comparing Ghirardelli OLD FASHIONED HOT CHOCOLATE ""DOUBLE CHOCOLATE"" to the new replacement Ghirardelli PREMIUM HOT COCOA ""DOUBLE CHOCOLATE."" Note it is now called Hot Cocoa & not Hot Chocolate. I have Chocolate Mocha and Chocolate Hazelnut to compare as well and that the differences are negligible. It is usually only 0.5g of fat but mostly 1 - 2g of sugar is the usual difference. And of course both use natural & artificial flavors.

However, others have complained about the Ghirardelli mixes being too sweet. To my taste the NEW formula is much too sweet! The Nutrition label bears out my biggest gripes with this REFORMULATED product: (1) It was sweet before. Now by UPPING the SUGAR so dramatically and adding salt as a sugar booster I no longer like it. (2) Not enough fat and other ingredients were added to convince me that any REAL gains in CHOCOLATE were made. ## The TASTE of the new formula bears this out. (I have taken to cutting the serving size and adding Cocoa powder to get more Chocolate and less sugar. (3) I DESPISE the shorting (Pumping it full of sugar and Cutting the servings by almost HALF.) (4) And the price stays the same for less. That really frosts my goblet I can no longer recommend this product. Ghirardelli You had a decent thing going and you blew it. PERSONALLY, I'm forwarding this review to the company and since Hot chocolate is just that. I'm going to experiment making either a home-made ganache syrup (melted chocolate & cream) or trying to find a way to finely grate or powder high quality chocolate to make my own brand. That's Really All The Old Style Was. Hot ""Chocolate"" not Cocoa. I'm sure for people with way too much money there are Hot chocolates available through boutiques where price is no object or... it IS the object. I'm not that rich. Besides if I come up with a home version that curls your toes then I may go into business myself or just enjoy it with a few friends. …",188 out of 195 users found this review helpful
" A tasty, gluten-free alternative to white rice",5,"My wife and I both love white rice. But as we enter middle age and seek a healthier and more nutritious diet, we are aware of the pitfalls of processed/refined carbohydrates and their effects on blood sugar levels and post-meal hunger pangs. We've tried several brands of brown rice, but never found one that was a satisfying replacement for our white rice and potato cravings. I stumbled upon Bob's Red Mill Grain Countrywild rice at Superstore and decided to give it a try. The results exceeded our expectations. It's much more flavorful than brown rice, with a nice nutty body and texture from the mixed brown and wild rices. Although it takes a bit longer to cook than white rice (55 vs 35 minutes), the wait is worth it, and the almost ""popcorn"" smell emanating from the kitchen whets the appetite. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful

" Fresh-tasting, mild yellow curry paste with long shelf life",5,"New to Thai cuisine, I asked to try a milder curry, my tastes running to a maximum of medium heat. Yellow curry was recommended, and the coconut milk based Thai version was a treat with both seafood and chicken-something I've had occasion to order again and again. So when trying to re-create the taste sensations above, I was less than thrilled at the idea of grinding individual spices, purchasing a number of pricey ingredients with limited shelf life and narrow applications. I did some research and found that many Thai housewives rely on the time and labor savings of using high quality curry pastes as the basis for soups, curries and more. Mae Ploy was one of the brands repeatly mentioned as high quality and fresh tasting. This brand comes in a handful of flavors and heat levels, with the Yellow Curry Paste being the first I was eager to try. It has a shelf life of 2 years, and the large plastic pouch also keeps very well nestled in its own colorful tub in the refrigerator. The flavors of lemon grass, shallot, gingery galanga, kaffir lime peel, warm spices and red chili are very well balanced. This is the only Mae Ploy Curry paste without shrimp paste, making it vegan-suitable as well as delicious with shellfish, fish or fowl. I like to snip off one corner of the clear packet, then squeeze out just the amount I need-anywhere from 1/2 teaspoon to 2 Tablespoons, depending on the recipe. This helps to maintain freshness and flavor and avoid waste. For Thai curry, I will combine the Yellow Curry Paste with a small amount of chicken broth, then add 3/4 Cup more broth per person, plus a can of coconut milk to mellow and round the flavor. A cup or two of chunked seafood or chicken, plus cubed potatoes and onion-simmered together for about 30 minutes- makes a very satisfying dish to serve with either traditional sticky rice or more the more occidental long grain variety. Mae Ploy's Thai Yellow Curry is also delicious with just a bit added to your favorite dip, salad dressing, or try a teaspoonful combined with 1 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt 'painted' over your favorite fish fillets and baked just until cooked through, (about 15-20 minutes at 325). The fine quality of this product has encouraged me to order another flavorful curry paste-also excellent-and I would highly recommend this product for those wishing to re-create favorite restaurant fare at a reasonal price, without tedious preparation. …",60 out of 61 users found this review helpful
 Only  Marginally Compatible as a K-Cup,2,"Coffee is fine. But I won't buy again. As another reviewer reported, this is not a standard K-Cup design. Simply a paper filter below a plastic collar. Shorter than a K-Cup, so doesn't come in contact with the bottom punch. Water flows through the filter and into the cup . . . albeit at a faster rate than being forced through the small bottom hole of the standard K-Cup. Do not attempt to brew a large cup, it will be too watery. Twelve servings come packed in a vacuum packed plastic bag. When you open the bag, all twelve containers are exposed, so you'll need to repackage them in a zip-lock bag if you want to keep them fresh.
