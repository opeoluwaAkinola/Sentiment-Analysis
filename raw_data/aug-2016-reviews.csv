 Slight Cinnamon Flavor,3,"This is a Light Roast coffee with only a faint cinnamon like flavor. I brewed this In my B40 at the 7.20oz mug size. Adding a sugar substitute and liquid creamer and it created a mellow flavor with at best a very slight cinnamon flavor. I was expecting more. I will try this coffee at the larger 9.25 mug size and report back. I brewed a cup at the larger 9.25oz lever and still no real desirable cinnamon flavor. But as a light roast coffee alone, it has a nice smooth flavor with low acidity; just wished they'd would have put just a tad more cinnamon in it …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 I'd give it zero if I could!!!!!!,1,"I usually go for Eden Soy or Trader Joe's as they are cheaper and usually taste as good or better, but I was in Walmart and said, ""what the hell."" Got a half gallon of Silk Vanilla soy milk and took it home immediately, storing it in a Trader Joe's insulated carry-all with some frozen goods on the way home. Right off, it seemed thick, but I shrugged it off as I hadn't had Silk for a while, and I remembered that their stuff was usually thicker than others. Well before a week had elapsed the carton was bloated with gas. The milk got really thick like paste. Yum, a half gallon of mystery Soy-gurt. I looked over the carton and found a ""guarantee"" of freshness and a web address. I used their web form and explained the defect in their product. Weeks later, they respond with the following response (basically tough poo, our ""guarantee"" isn't worth the cardboard it's written on): Thank you for your recent e-mail to Silk®. We appreciate your interest in our products. We guarantee the freshness and quality of our products if opened by the freshness date code and used within seven to ten days. However, our products are perishable food items and spoilage may occur if the products are stored in the refrigerator beyond the recommended number of days after the seal has been broken or if there was an interruption in maintaining the proper storage temperature. We apologize for the inconvenience, and hope you will continue to enjoy our products. For us, the good news is that you cared enough to let us know about it. Thanks again for contacting the Consumer Affairs Department. Sincerely, Yvonne Ortega Consumer Response Representative This is my response back: Yvonne: Thank you for your entirely cut-and-pasted, canned response. I appreciate that you didn't even bother to address me by name. Your lack of care and unfettered indifference overwhelms me. You obviously don't ""guarantee the freshness and quality"" of your products. Otherwise, you would be offering a refund on my purchase, or some form of compensation for the stale milk you produced. Your product's texture was a little off from day one and your product went completely bad on my family before ""seven to ten days after the freshness date."" There was no ""interruption in maintaining the proper storage temperature"" during our trip to WalMart, as we use reusable insulated shopping bags for our refrigerated and frozen goods. So, instead of trying to pass off the blame for your faulty product and shirking your promises, you should consider honoring your ""guarantee."" I had almost forgotten about writing to you, but due to the nature of your response I have to let other consumers know just how worthless a ""guarantee"" from WhiteWave is. I'm glad your title is ""Consumer Response Representative"" instead of Consumer Care Representative; at least WhiteWave is honest about that. Disgusted, So there you go, a premium priced product with below average taste and consistency, and worthless customer service!!! …",13 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 The Real Deal,5,"Great hickory flavor. Used it to make pulled pork for 20 people. It has a rich, natural flavor, no chemical aftertaste.

 Amazingly Good!,5,"I do not like pre-cooked pork rinds, not even made fresh in the Mexican Carnecerias, but hubby likes them, so I decided to buy these. I was shocked to find that they were light, airy and crispy. Some bags were saltier than others, but we've cooked up about 5 so far and the majority aren't overly salty. Another reviewer mentioned watching them to figure out how long the cooking time should be. In our 1100 watt oven 40-43 seconds seems to be just right. The key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated. Leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy. Since I follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons, I like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs. I'm still trying to come up with more dip ideas that will go well with the flavoring. I wish they'd put out a version that didn't have seasoned salt as I'd like them with just salt and/or garlic. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",19 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Chocolates might be great; shipping was less so; customer service is great,3,"While it was shipped to me insulated in styrofoam, no cold packs were included in the shipment--which was heading to Atlanta in early September (the American South in the summer). I assumed that since I was paying over $20 for shipping--the absolute fastest time, greater care would be taken to ensure that the product arrived intact. Unfortunately, the chocolates I received were largely melted. I do not recommend the purchase of this item to be shipped to any region experiencing temperatures above 78 degrees. UPDATE: Received an e-mail, which read (in part) as follows: First, my apologies for not answering you earlier... I didn't notice there was a melting issue with your order till late last week while addressing a small more recent delivery problem. Anyway, as you have noticed with your order, melting can and does happen in transit, but luckily only with an insignificant number of our packages as we only experience about two dozen or three dozen a year out of well over 15,000 packages. Insignificant when view in percentage terms, but still most infuriating when this happens. The e-mail went on to note that they are replacing my order. I am stunned--I have had a melting issue before with a different chocolate company (remember, I live in Atlanta, Georgia, where summer temperatures are a bear), and I received nothing in the way of satisfaction. I figured it would be the same and didn't even bother to directly contact the company (a mistake on my part). I am *very* pleased with this level of service. …",61 out of 64 users found this review helpful

" I've purchased this several times, because it's GREAT!",5,"The strawberry banana flavor of this individually packaged drink mix is really out-of-this-world! It's as good as the far more expensive bottled drinks. The packaging is ultra-convenient, and saves me the hassle of carrying in cans of diet soda. Besides, who really needs the carbonation? Now, as for the ""hunger satisfaction"" part -- I can't believe it, but it really does seem to work. Now, it is true that if I drank plain water before a meal, it would also kill my hunger. However, the taste of this stuff is so great that it really does satisfy my craving for something sweet. So, if this is ""science,"" ""magic,"" or my will to believe in the power of Crystal Light -- I don't know.

 What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical,1,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands. This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi. Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering. The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much. While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal. Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products. Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money). Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer. One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer. Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail *Concentrate Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99 Liters of product per container 12 Flavor/l $0.42 *Carbonator Volume of CO2 130 Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99 CO2 cost per liter $0.23 *Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter Equipment cost $89.00 Equipment life (years) 5 Discount rate (cost of money) 8% Liters per month 10.00 Monthly amortized cost $1.80 Cost of equipment per liter $0.18 *Water Cost with Brita Filtration Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004 Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95 Brita cost per liter $0.0373 Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377 (assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration) ***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2 SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73 Without filtered water: SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65 *****What does CO2 Really Cost???? THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW *Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit) weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2 cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35 CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams *Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation losses: 10% available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85% net accessible CO2 of total: 77% usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams *Output carbonated liters of water: 2,479 cost per liter in USD$: $0.014 *SodaStream Output SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product) Cost per refill: $30.00 cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231 *SodaStream Markup Economics ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534% math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing This is an incredible 1500% markup Pros Saves plastic Allows flexible mixture of flavors Cons Cost of output is not compelling Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit ***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times. At the time of this review, I did NOT have an investment in SodaStream either short or long. In the past, I have both owned the stock and shorted it (bet against it). I may be on either side of the trade by the time you read this -- I am not very sentimental. …",31 out of 36 users found this review helpful
 Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS,1,"We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb. …",8 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Vita Coco Buyers BEWARE- Mold inside,1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:32 Mins </span>I have been on the coconut water wagon for over 2 years now. I truly feel there is no better coconut water than the one that comes directly from the source in hand. Because fresh coconuts are not easy to find I started buying Vita Coco over a year ago. From all other coconut waters out there I felt theirs was the best tasting, best quality and I also liked the fact that the source of the water came from just one country and not multiple ones. I have been a happy consumer for over a year, most of my purchases came from the local supermarket until I decided to purchase the vita coco 6 pack on Superstore as part of the subscribe and save program I gave a box to my mother in law. Earlier this week she opened one of the containers and she said the taste seemed a bit off, a little rancid and she felt like I had swallowed something more than just water. She decided to take a closer look and I was appalled at what she uncovered. Huge chunks of mold her water; it made her sick to her stomach. I am sad to say that after this experience we will no longer consume this product. My concern is what kind of quality control is out there and is this the first incident. I have heard many reviews talking about rancid taste and moldy taste I wonder how many of those containers had the same stuff inside. Worse of all is that I have been giving this water to my 3 year old who loves coconut water.

They couldn't tell the difference between it and any other pre-packaged mix from the store. Don't be intimidated by the bean flours! They make for a moist, soft, fantastic chocolate cake!

" Delicious, Quality Popcorn",4,"I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Superstore. This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion. It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic. When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels. The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease. The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be). However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet. I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping. It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank! A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice. I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use! UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+! :o) I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels. I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare. I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.

 Verified Purchaser of Cyclone Blend ~ By a Coffee Snob,5,"I purchased this on Superstore and have no association or affiliation with this company. I was skeptical because of reviews but decided to give it a try since I LOVE my Keurig! And we LOVE it! I like a nice bold cup but that is smooth... this is it!

I made this coffee first for my husband on the 3rd setting and took a sip .... YUMMMY!!!!!! It was PERFECT... bold and smooth! I was so excited! My husband took a sip and loved it too! I am glad that I can have one good full cup on the third setting and not two cups of Emeril's Bold (which I love too) or Green Mountain Italian Blend (which I LOVE too). I did have one cup where some grounds were found on the top of the coffee... I was like ""Oh man... this is not good!!"" I just took a paper towel and skimmed it and they came right out and it hasn't happened since. And we've had about 8 cups of it all together.

 Honey Nut Cheerios #1 for sure,5,"Alright, I'll preface by saying that I have not had the pricing or expiration (not that I would notice) issues that some of the other reviewers have faced.

 The best of the almond flours,5,"I have tried several brands of almond flour in the last year, and they are languishing in my freezer. The others are more coarse and good for a non-flour, or non-gluten pie crust, (as in a pie crust that would call for crushed nuts anyway) or something not needing a refined, soft texture, like a granola bar perhaps. But if you want success in your baking, especially for cakes, pancakes, muffins, biscuits,(oh so good and tender!), then this is the almond flour to use. The texture is very fine, so it incorporates well in beaten batters. As it is not as heavy, whatever you are baking will rise higher, be lighter, and have a soft, nice texture, than when using more coarse almond flour. I have used it alone for low carb, or non-wheat baking, and have mixed it with non-gluten, and non-wheat, (but with gluten) flours, with complete success. Some flours are so strong in taste, they overpower anything else one puts in the batter. The soft flavor allows your other flavors, like sweetener, flavoring, extracts, nuts, or fruits, to be more flavorful, and balanced in the baked goods. what I received was slightly sweet, almost no nutty flavor, without any trace of oxidation or spoiling. I keep a recipe or two worth in my refrigerator, and the bulk of it in my freezer. Depending on what I am making , I may let it come to room temperature, or just use it cold. Your recipe will guide you. To use, just stir gently, measure lightly, and continue with your recipe. The flour costs a bit more, but can be purchased in bulk quantities. See the box for information if you cannot get the size you want on Superstore. I think you will be happy using this flour. This flour is a great answer to low carb, non-wheat, or non-gluten baking! And no, I do not work for the company or Superstore, but am happy to have found such an excellent product for my low carb, non-wheat baking! …",58 out of 58 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",18 out of 24 users found this review helpful
" Package Says, ""Processed on Equipment that Handles Wheat.""",4,"....ergo, it may not be gluten-free. However, if they clean the lines in between, it might be safe: I'm not sure if they're gluten-free. They don't seem like they're really contaminated, but I can't say for sure because I didn't eat more than one serving. This is a neat idea, but to really cook them so they don't fall apart, you have to cook them in hot water, then ""shock"" them with cold water, and repeat a couple of times, which is a fair amount of effort. They also taste more like plants than noodles. They're interesting, but I wouldn't buy them again, and the rest of the box went to a food bank. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" Good product, but...",4,"I've yet to find any of the dogs I know that love it. I still have my allergic dog eating it, but she has to be hungry to eat this without doctoring. My vet doesn't want me feeding her people food so I add some of Newman's or Happy Hips canned to it. I've talked to a couple of vets about prescription diet and they all push the big company brand names. The common objection appears to be the soy used in Newman's to increase the protein count. I am willing to put a little flavor in this to feed may dog high quality, social responsible food. I may be the only person who has made the following mistake but, assuming you catch the Superstore sales, make sure you are ordering the bag size you want.

 Great taste when cold brewed!,5,"I have been drinking this tea for months now along with the Tazo Zen green tea. I love both flavors and have found that they make a wonderful iced tea (the only way I like to drink tea). I have found that if you cold brew this tea and the Zen green tea, they do have the flavor undertones that the box states. It almost seems to have a ""solidness"" to the flavor that seems to fit the breakfast concept well. I definitely recommend it if you like a nice smooth flavor to your black tea. I use the Starbucks Classic syrup in this tea and the flavor is perfect together (you can buy classic syrup in a bottle from almost any Starbucks location). Just as a side for those who are interested. Cold brewing just means that you place the tea bags in the fridge in water and let it set, usually at least 3 hours. It's that simple! It maintains the full subtle flavor of the tea much better and is almost impossible to turn bitter or mess it up unless you use too many tea bags. This only works if you plan to have iced tea of course. I use 4 ""Awake"" tea bags in 2 quarts of water and let it set overnight. I don't remove the tea bags until I have drank all the tea. It's delicious and super easy. I would recommend trying it to anyone who likes iced tea! …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

I drink...A LOT of water...My dad taught me the appreciation for water a long time ago, and growing up in athletics, water was and continues to be my preferred source for hydration survival!

I dropped a cap full of the water into an almost empty bud vase where a dying red rose had made her home for the previous 2 weeks. Her petals were crispy and all of her leaves had dropped...her stem was brown half the way down and only half of the stem remained green. I watched for several days with the expectation of a miracle. Perhaps, her petals would come back to life!

 A solid replacement for certain kinds of dishes,4,"Like other reviewers I heard about the miracle noodles through Dr. Oz (Second hand as we don't have TV in our household) and decided to give them a shot. I got the multipack of the 7oz bags of the Fettucini style noodles. I prepared a test pack for my wife and I of the noodles exactly as described on the bag. (No microwaving them for me.) Opening: First, I will say the noodles didn't have a pleasant aroma upon opening the pouch, but neither was really off putting. It wasn't especially strong or extremely fishy. The best I can do to describe the odor was close to that of a can of regular chunk tuna. But unlike opening that can of tuna and getting packing water on your hands the odor did all but disappear with the rinse, blanch, and a final rinse before drying on towels. Trying a single dried noodle was like eating the number zero if you can imagine it. It just didn't even register other than something had been in the mouth, chewed, and swallowed. There was minimal remaining odor from the fermenting and I had to really try to pick it up. Cooking: While the noodles dried I heated a pan on medium heat with a half tsp of butter and added two or three cloves of minced garlic and cooked it until it was just browning and then tossed in the noodles. I followed this shortly with 1 1/2 Tbsp. or so of a teriyaki sauce. My wife is Korean so there is always crushed red pepper in the house, which I added three good pinches of to the mix and cooked while mixing for another couple minutes. I noted when the noodles hit the pan how they immediately took up the remaining butter and also a good portion of the teriyaki sauce when added. The color of the noodle went from white/semi transparent to more brown and reminded me of rice noodles in Phad Thai. There was no trace of the slight odor from their raw state at this point. Taste verdict: Both my wife and I enjoyed them and plan to add them to other dishes as a substitute for other asian noodles. They picked up the flavor of garlic, salt, and pepper just how I wanted and expected. The next time I made them I added chicken to the mix for protein and some veggies which I felt the lack of made for a tasty but not entirely satisfying dish. (Though I did want to try them without the noodles competing with any other primary ingredients.) The next time I have left over kimchi jigae from a dinner out it will be getting a pack added to it rather than rice for my lunch. As a snack food or small meal I think they are good and even with my preparation here they are better across the whole nutrition label than going for a package of the Nongshim Kimchi Ramyun my wife likes sometimes. (We usually add fresh kimchi, egg, and whatever else to bulk it up a bit though. I can easily imagine doing the same with the Shirataki noodles.) Texture: Ever had the Korean dish jabchae? The noodles give less resistance to biting than those cellophane noodles and so don't need the extra cutting with scissors before eating. Importantly it is not at all like wheat pasta. They also squeak a bit when you bite through which was unexpected but not unpleasant. Would I recommend them: Yes, for certain dishes. I took two packages to my parents to try since my Mom was the one who told me about them but I am waiting to hear back what she thought. I am going to order some of the other shape varieties and do a test with marinara but I am not expecting a great result. The texture of the noodle is substantially different from wheat pastas and this leads me to think it won't work well, but hey I could be wrong. …",87 out of 91 users found this review helpful

" Bad Packaging, Great product but can't recommend shipping",1,"I'm giving this a one star because obviously there is a problem with the packaging seals on this product. The only reason I order is that I don't have time to go buy these at a local store which is about an hour from my house--thus ordering makes sense. Except that when my shipment arrives there are 3 packages out of the 6 boxes that are leaking. I open up the box and there is a terrible stench. Spoiled coconut water smells awful, especially in the 100 degree summer temps we've been having. So I unpack the boxes, and pour out the spoiled contents because of the smell, and then go to Superstore to try to report that 3 out of the 6 boxes in the package were damaged. Well, it looks like the only option is to return the package or request a refund. I need the other 3 boxes that were not leaking, and can't find an option to report this to anyone. Then I read the other reviews for this product and note that I'm not the only one whose experienced issues with leaking during shipment. Since there doesn't appear to be a way to be credited for only the items in the shipment that were leaking, and keep the others, and I would have had to get clean boxes and repack the horrible smelling boxes in new packaging to ship back, I just decided to keep the undamaged ones, and to let others know. I won't be ordering this size again in the future, and will just make the one hour trip to my grocer that carries the larger size and then buy locally in bulk next time.

 Gold standard...Years of research on my part...,5,"When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my ""baby"" each day. Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life... I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption. I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me) At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud. Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods. The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label. Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this! Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic. I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about. Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out... (p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them! But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!) So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.) Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest... if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal. This is hard to find. So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet. He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!) I, personally, have helped friends CURE ""health"" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept ""treating"" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and ""cured"" them! Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both. I am a raving fan. and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it. …",119 out of 120 users found this review helpful
 Positives: it's absolutely sea salt.  Negatives: the sand in it proves this fact.,2,"I got two bags of this sea salt after I had a small sample shaker that I really loved. It has excellent flavor, is genuine sea salt, and you use less sea salt than regular salt when seasoning food because it is a stronger flavor. All good things. Unfortunately, after many, many tries to ensure it wasn't my imagination...both bags contained sand as well. Something must have been wrong with their filtering system to eliminate sand from the salt during manufacturing. But, because it happened in both bags I had bought I felt it must not be too uncommon. Imagine when I cooked an egg dish to share with the office at breakfast...you know how it is when you eat something at the beach and, no matter how careful you are, some sand gets in so you bite down on grit? That was take one. Then I made soup...with sand...take two....After two more tries I knew it wasn't a fluke of the kitchen or the dish or some odd salt. After all, salt dissolves in cooking. I tried both bags and gave up. I'm not saying it's awful. The taste was good and I might try it again in the future...but this is a fairly exceptional flaw so I gotta pan the cooking results it produced for now. …",17 out of 25 users found this review helpful
 Some of the other reviews are for a DIFFERENT flavor,5,"If you can get one at the store first, obviously try it before ordering a 16 pack. This is the plain Jocalat bar and I can say I am hooked. We gave up processed sugar and are going the organic route on everything. And this is perfect for a chocolate fix. It's great because there is no added sugar (or sugar substitute) unless you count figs. If you are addicted to the fat (butter) and sugar of the majority of candy bars, this is different. Tastes what I remember a brownie to be like except less sweet. When you get off sugar, your tastebuds change. It's worth it though. Some other people, if they are referring to this actual flavor, probably are thinking it isn't sweet enough. Did not care at all for the orange flavored one. Haven't tried the mint. Coffee/hot variety goes against what I'm doing health wise. I'm alright with pure chocolate though. I think this is as good as it gets. ------ UPDATE: Haven't eaten these in a long time.

If you like gingerbread (not gingersnaps or gingerbread cookies, mind you -- actual gingerbread, the kind that you can eat by the slice) than I am willing to bet that you will love these bars as much as I do. The taste is exactly like that of freshly baked gingerbread; the texture is moist like gingerbread but crunchy because of the nuts the bar contains. The crunchiness, in my opinion, doesn't detract a whit from the overall fabulousness of these bars -- in fact, I would say it adds to it. Finally (and this is true of all Larabars) the stunning brevity of the ingredient list bears noting. Larabars contain no added sugar, no artificial flavoring or coloring, and no preservatives. All of the sweetness and flavor (and there is just enough of the former and plenty of the latter) come from wholly natural, healthful sources. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 My Dogs LOVE these,5,"There are several things I like about this product, including that these are naturally shed antlers that are collected, cleaned, packaged and then sold without involving killing to get them. Somebody goes out and collects these and that is probably part of why they are fairly expensive, even on-line...I first found these in our local pet store...but forget about the retail price, (IF you can even find them,) the price at the pet store was twice what I found on-line, and the antlers were not nearly as large. None of the big chain pet stores carry these, at least not in my area so far. I ordered these through Superstore and was amazed and delighted that they arrived literally the next day. That said, my dogs simply ADORE these things. They keep my new, and very young 100# rescue lab busy literally for hours, but do not ""slime"" my floors or carpet, (or our bed or couch.) He loves to set one on my desk as an ""offering,"" which I actually don't mind since they are VERY clean compared to all the more traditional bones, hoofs and chews. Additionally, they double as a great ""fetch"" toy in the yard. Essentially my guys just chew them down to the nubbin's, but without any damage to my stuff. Highly recommend if you want a clean chew/toy that will keep your dog busy for hours without wrecking the party, and helps with tarter build-up on their teeth in the process. Really a great idea, and a great product. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" Not the treat of yesteryear, that's for sure.",1,"Thinking I'd be wickedly clever and get a fun treat -- one that's vegan and also contains fiber, hee hee -- into my kids and the rest of the unsuspecting Trick-or-Treaters this year, I ordered a bunch of these bulk boxes of Cracker Jack bags for distribution last Halloween. What a disappointment, in two ways. 1. My suspicion is that, unlike the 1970s and 80s when I was a kid and enjoyed these, modern food science has now created a popcorn scanner that sees inside each popped kernel to find out whether it has popped fully or incompletely-- incompletely meaning a hard stone part lurks inside. If the latter is ascertained, it gets routed onto the Cracker Jack bag-filling line. I'd say a good half or more of the popped corns in the bags we received contained an unchewable hard part. 2. I strongly suspect attorneys seeking to limit settlements by Cracker Jack, Inc. to parents whose children found a way to harm themselves with yesterday's prizes like plastic spinners and ""moving"" pictures have mandated that all Cracker Jack prize designers limit their creations to ""paper only"" models. They were undoubtedly encouraged to do so by some MBA whiz (most likely a Harvard Business School graduate) who also realized how cheap and lightweight paper is to manufacture, thereby saving on both production and shipping costs, in addition to settlement fees. The unfortunate result is that, unlike the actually fun prizes I remember (a few of which, I am embarrassed to say, I still have packed away somewhere), today's children can look forward to Cracker Jack prizes like paper pencil toppers (two slits and put on the end of that pencil -- wow!) and -- I kid you not -- ""arrange the face of Abe Lincoln"" or ""turn the young face into the elderly Susan B. Anthony"" activities. Don't get me wrong; I love the Abolitionists and Suffragettes, and Susan B. Anthony, having the honor of being among both camps, is my favorite among them. I will also add that my self-righteous pride expanded as I realized I was distributing to neighborhood children lessons about American historical figures along with a vegan, fiber-containing snack, all masquerading as a Halloween treat. But the Cracker Jacks that children love are gone. Mine, who are in 1st and 4th grade, won't even eat the leftover bags, and so I started eating them myself-- except I couldn't force myself to chew through all those hard kernels. And when I tossed my kids the prizes, they said, ""no, thanks."" I write this not to deride a classic treat but to beseech the powers-that-be at Cracker Jack to restore their product to the quality of its glory days, when hard kernels weren't plentiful and the prizes were worth finishing your bag or box for. Arise, Crack Jack, to this challenge, and reclaim your rightful place in American childhood! …",10 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" Outstanding, Bold, Lively Sumatran. best of the K-cups",5,"First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine. Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being ""tangy"" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich. IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4. I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc. Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star. Stale and bitter. I will definitely stay with Puck's. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 soup not salt,4,"I've searched through many a local supermarket in many a Chinatown, and this is the dashi that I default to. If you look at the ingredients, you'll see that the first ingredient is bonito flakes and the second is mackerel flakes. Salt and MSG aren't even on the list. What you get is a real fish based dashi flavor instead of the salty liquid that you get with just about every other product. This lacks all of the salt and MSG that you may be used to, so be prepared for a more delicate, subtle flavor. This is what you use when you want real flavor. The packages come in individual packets made of what appears to be cheesecloth. It's not a powder or a mix. It's actual fish flakes. The whole packet looks quite a bit like a giant teabag. Why did I drop a star? It is rather pricy, but you get what you pay for. This price is very similar to what you'd find in a real Asian supermarket. Also, it's tough to buy 50 packages of dashi unless you use it quite often. Then again, dashi lasts quite a while in a dark, dry environment, so it may be worth it to stock up. EDIT: this is for ten boxes. Each box has five individually wrapped packets. Each packet makes approximately 1 liter of dashi. As mentioned before, the packets are giant tea bags, so you can't make half a packet at a time. …",21 out of 22 users found this review helpful
" no synthetic DHA, no cane sugar, the only true organic formula...",5,"My 8 month old son gets 50% breast milk, 50% formula. Of course breast is best, but we all know how that goes when returning to work...supply was not possible to be met for my son. The week I went back to work, be it stress, lack of time with baby latching on, etc...I couldn't pump nearly enough..If you're like me, and need to supplement, even if you don't want to, consider this about Baby's Only Organic formula: 1. No synthetic DHA added. Recent findings show that DHA added to infant formula (in all cases of organic formulas including Earth's Best, except Baby's Only) is extracted from fungus and algae, using hexane solvents, bleach etc - As a biochemist, this is disconcerting. Hexane is a human neurotoxin and narcotic agent. Organic ingredient? Not in the slightest. It will damage nerves, brain, heart and who knows what else. Believe it or not, the FDA doesn't have a regulation on hexane extractions in food.. . The best source of DHA are natural sources, not synthetic. Good DHA sources are animal-based (eggs, fish, meat, etc) and of course are found in breast milk. The fact that no synthetic DHA is included was the #1 seller for me on this formula. Also, Baby's Only manufacturer sells a separate supplement of DHA that you can add to the formula, which is egg-yolk based - all natural. Some might be concerned about egg allergies - Most egg allergies come from the proteins in the egg white, not the yolk, but in the very rare chance that the egg yolk could cause an allergy, it's nice that they sell it separately and not mixed in the formula. 2. Only 60% lactose may be a good thing...in response to ahbnyc's comment ""Earth's Best uses Lactose as their primary sugar (carb source). In human breast milk, lactose is almost the exclusive source for carbs...exactly the same as Earth's Best. Again on the Baby's Only website they claim lactose to be inferior to their brown rice syrup. How can they do this?? They show no evidence to support their claim, especially when Lactose is what's in breast milk!!"" According to the American Pregnancy Association, lactose accounts for approximately 40% of the total calories provided by breast milk. Why is it that when infants are started on lactose-based formula, so many have problems digesting it and then many assume they are lactose intolerant and are given soy or lactose-free formulas?? Isn't this counter intuative if human milk is lactose based? True lactose intolerance in babies is extremely rare - Did anyone ever wonder if the commercial formulas contain WAY more lactose than a baby's sensitive system can handle and way more than is found in breast milk? It is possible to have too much lactose in a baby's diet and this may be why they have problems when switched to formula while the same baby may be fine with breast milk. Also, lactose is a simple sugar which easily spikes insulin levels, contributing to overly plump babies that have a higher risk of obesity later in life. Just look at the growth chart differences of formula-fed vs. breast-fed babies. Rice syrup takes longer to break-down as it's more complex, and won't spike insulin levels like lactose. Rice syrup may not be suitable for a newborn - true. But Nature's One - Baby's Only manufacturer clearly recommends breast is best for newborns...There may be no perfect formula for a newborn. 3. No cane sugar. Similac Organic is garbage because they add cane sugar as a source of carbs. Way to add to the child diabetic epidemic. 4. It's way less expensive than Earth's Best. I recommend this formula - my son has had no problems with it and I feel good knowing he's getting ALL organic ingredients. …",51 out of 53 users found this review helpful

 Baker's yeast,5,"As far as I am concerned, bulk is the only way to buy yeast. These little packets and tiny jars are ridiculously priced for what you are getting, and beside that most people arent using enough yeast in their baking either. I use yeast for everything from bread to pancakes to corn bread. I use more than most people do. Unlike baking powder and soda, yeast is actually nutritional (as long as it is cooked, never eat it uncooked). Yeast adds a nice flavor and aroma not found in these 'powders'. I don't know where some of the common practices for using yeast came from, but I've found that you don't need to let things rise two or three times unless, that is, you are looking for a way to pass time. Also like in pancakes, just mix up the batter and throw it on the griddle, it rises for me. But don't be so stingy with the yeast. Yeast is not some rare thing that needs to be conserved, actually it is cheaply made, yet yeast boasts rather high nutritional value. I may be biased, I rarely if ever bake with white flour, I use whole wheat, corm meal or perhaps rye, mostly whole wheat. I use egg in my dough, batter etc., rather than the added white flour for gluten. Again the egg adds flavor, nutrition and RISE POWER without damaging the texture or character of the whole wheat or cornmeal product. Red Star is offering a great deal here, and the price is right. …",35 out of 37 users found this review helpful

 Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on,5,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups. I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive. I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products. If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :) EcoBrew VS Solofill First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew. Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker. These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable! I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product. The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly. …",559 out of 562 users found this review helpful

 Bought 32 Pounds,4,"I bought 32 pounds. Bob's Red Mill doesn't have the occasional gritty and sandy shell specks like another brand. Coconut flour, which is fairly mild in flavor, is gluten-free, high-fiber, and high-protein. It naturally sweetens dishes even though it's low in carbohydrates - glycemic load of zero. I use this versatile fiber for smoothies, pancakes, muffins, brownies, and pizza crusts. You can also use it to thicken soups and sauces. Because coconut flour lacks gluten, you have to use many eggs to bind ingredients. However, I reduce the overpowering flavor of the eggs and increase the fat (coconut oil) and fluids because the flour absorbs large amounts of moisture and dries out the products. Blueberry coconut flour muffins taste great and mimic cornbread with a slightly fibrous texture. Whether you are eating low-carb, diabetic-friendly, gluten-free, or any other diet, you can still use this versatile, virtually non-allergenic coconut flour to boost your fiber intake and add variety to your dishes.

Also try in your hair as a conditioner, hot oil treatment or sealant also cuticles. I am an african american woman with natural 4a hair. I can't say enough about this. I started with the 16oz, but the more I used this the more I found that I needed a larger size. To my amazement I found this gigantic size. I put some in my smaller containers and leave one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom, one in the baby room and the largest one in the kitchen. Can't get enough of coconut oil. …",55 out of 55 users found this review helpful
" Great product, Horrible customer service.",3,"I received the garden and followed the directions exactly as written. Everything was sprouting wonderfully except the cilantro. There are germination days listed on each pod and the cilantro states 14 days. Everything else in the garden was growing great! I wrote 3 emails to aerogarden and after a week no response. I've called them three times and been on hold over 15 minutes each never getting a customer service representative. I have left a voicemail on their vm service, still ZERO response.

 Bait & switch! Not the real thing if from The Spice Lab!,1,"Das Salt fleur de sel is the best of those I've tried. Awesome as finishing salt and a touch on chocolate ice cream can't be beat. Update 5/10/2011: Superstore will not let me delete the review I wrote in 2010 (it keeps the date) and start over, so all I can do is give this added information. Since my first purchase, I've tried a few other brands of fleur de sel de Guerande. Das Salt is the best. Unfortunately, the salt sold by Spice Lab is NOT Das Salt even though he uses a Das image and description & says it is by Das Salt. Seriously, if it ships from The Spice Lab it is NOT Das Salt. What you will get from The Spice Lab is repackaged salt in an unsealed container and a lot of trust-me-trust-me-trust-me **** about how honest the seller is -- from him, of course. No real surprise the seller misrepresents the product -- would you buy it if he advertised it as it is: repackaged salt, who knows how, from who knows where? This section is product reviews, not seller reviews, so buyer beware. My first review was for Das Salt fleur de sel, not the stuff you will get from The Spice Lab, but you'd never know it. I guess because Mr. Spice Lab says he is selling Das Salt, the reviews still apply but as noted, he is NOT selling Das Salt. Some of the reviews here were written for the real deal and not for that you will get from Spice Lab. Update 5/19/2011. After multiple complaints, it must be that Superstore made Spice Lab take down their falsely advertised product because Superstore is back to selling Das Salt from Das. The reviews follow the product, not the seller. I will leave this post as negative in case dear Brett from Spice Lab tries his trickery again. My praise for Das Salt is HIGH. My low rating is for FAKE Das salt sold by Spice Lab. …",70 out of 72 users found this review helpful

 if you can swallow the superfood sediment...,3,"I've tried mixing this in different things and the taste is overwhelming. To me it tastes mostly like green tea and peppermint, which in and of itself is not too bad, but the fact that the powder does not seem to dissolve at all kind of grosses me out. The only way I could swallow it is by using only half a scoop in a very large (24oz) glass of water. Then the flavor is much lighter and actually kind of refreshing. It still doesn't seem to dissolve completely and the bottom gets pretty grainy. Despite this, it truly is a superfood; the ingredients in it are the healthiest green foods as well as the more exotic green foods, some of which would be difficult to get in your diet other ways (wheat grass, barley grass, alfalfa, spirulina, spinach, chlorella, acai, green tea, flax seed, and digestive enzymes). All of these foods have been suggested to be some of the healthiest foods around. The 'non-organic' version of the product depicted here is actually 70% organic, and if you're a 100% organic kind of person, Amazing Grass also offers an all organic version for a slightly steeper price. A list of the ingredients and nutritional information can be found on the amazing grass website. …",23 out of 28 users found this review helpful
 Yuck! Annie Chun should pay my medical bill!,1,"I am growing more and more interested in Asian food. I am almost a regular at some nearby Chinese and Japanese restaurants (unlimited snow crab legs during the weekends, yum!), and I also enjoy Nongshim noodles, especially when I am getting creative and add extras. That's why I ordered this set of teriyaki chow mein. It was the first time I tried Annie Chun brand. Well, what's to be said? First, the noodles looked just OK, kind of like spaghettis. Of course I can get better Mexican fideos for less, but nevermind, I thought it is worth a try. The sauce was weird looking, but the bad part was when I tasted the combination. Ugh! It tastes awful, and I believe it caused me a stomach ache that lasted until next day. I almost went to the doctor. I am not saying it is bad for you, but for me, with an European stomach, so much abused by the American processed food, this ""Asian"" processed food was too much. I guess you could be fine with an Asian stomach. Can someone borrow me one for the rest of the pack or should I toss it? …",1 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 Beware the maltitol sweetener...,1,"I tried this syrup just to avoid all the calories in regular maple syrup. I used a moderate amount on my pancakes and thought it tasted pretty good. About an hour after eating, I began to paying the price for consuming a product containing maltitol as the sweetener. I've never had so much gas and intestinal discomfort (for about 8 hours). These are well known side-effects of consuming this sugar alcohol and I am quite surprised it's been mentioned in only 1 other review of this product on Superstore. Just Google ""maltitol side effects"" and you'll get the picture. In my opinion, this product should be not be sold until it is reformulated with another sweetener. There are much better sweeteners than maltitol. …",48 out of 51 users found this review helpful
" Good flavor, excellent results, mild flavor.",4,"This tea was very good, however the mild flavor got boring after drinking it for a long period of time. Drinking it sporadically would probably be best. It is a very nice tea for right before bed, and does not need sugar or honey for a nice flavor. I would order it again, however I think my 6 boxes will keep me well stocked for a very long time. My favorite tea from yogi is the Cocoa Spice, which I suggest to everyone as it has a nice deep flavor and can be taken with or without milk. …",9 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 I Crave It Like Coffee!!!,5,"I was a caffeine addict until it started to affect my health. By the doctor's orders, I backed off the caffeine. I went onto Superstore looking for decaf coffee, and I found Pero. WHAT A GREAT FIND!!! I now have several cups per day, but I don't feel guilty about it. It has 3 ingredients--barley, malted barley, and chicory. Maybe I am hooked on the chicory. Is that possible? I doubt it. Anyway, I swear this stuff tastes more like coffee every time I drink it. I have been tempted to play a practical joke with people at work by asking them to try my new ""coffee"". I'll bet I could fool many of them.

" This is ""the one""",5,"I have been taste-testing so many brands and roasts of k-cups to determine our favorites that I feel like a 'lab rat.' The Tully's Italian Roast immediately stood out from the rest--love at first sip! The other reviews are accurate by describing it as aromatic, smooth and flavorful, not bitter nor weak. I make my first cup of the morning by using one k-cup on the large cup setting, then I make my add'l cups of coffee using one k-cup and a combination of both the middle and smallest cup; that way I get more coffee using one K-cup. It still holds a robust flavor but just not as heavily as the first, which is what I like to do after drinking sev'l cups. I use cream & sugar, so this routine works for me. You may or may not tend to tweak your ritual the same way, but it just goes to show you that you can ""think out of the k-cup."" …",32 out of 33 users found this review helpful

 A great-tasting product...,5,"I was encouraged to try this for at least two reasons: we live in an earthquake-prone area and I wanted it for our disaster supply kit. The other reason was for my convenience because we drink our fair share of coffee and cocoa (hot chocolate) and want to have a great-tasting cream available all the time. This product fits the bill on both accounts. I am also going to try the Nido full cream powder and also the Willpowder dried cream (low-carb diet). But you can't go wrong with Peak powdered milk with cream, it is delicious! ADDITIONAL REMARKS/UPDATE: I haven't yet ordered the Nido, it seems expensive. Having compared both WILLPOWDER and PEAK products, PEAK wins! Willpowder is OK but it has a strong aftertaste and consistency that got to us. Keep in mind that if you're on a low-carb diet, Willpowder is cream with zero carbs and Peak is powdered whole milk so it has carbs. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Major False Advertizing Here,1,"this is so unbelievably horrible! what it claims, the packaging, the wording, etc... anyone who makes a child drink this should be arrested for child abuse. i know, kind of extreme... just trying to make a point.

 Pretty decent tasting low-carb bar with good nutritional profile,4,"I'm a big fan of nutrition bars as a convenient snack or meal substitute in a pinch and this bar is delicious! This was my first thinkThin bar and I found it interesting for a few reasons. The bar is enrobed by a thin layer of what looks like white chocolate. The bar itself is chewy, soft and possesses a cake-like texture which I enjoyed. It had the right amount of sweetness for me and the flavor profile is quite simple and straightforward; nothing spicy or tricky. The only thing I disliked about the bar was the slightly synthetic-tasting white chocolate flavor, but it was not so terrible that I wouldn't eat it again. I would definitely be interested in trying out the other flavors when I get a chance. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 great,5,"Since I've started buying groceries at Superstore I have discovered ""taste great"" is a pretty subjective thing. That's obvious since everyone has different tastes, but even so I wonder about some of the great reviews on some things. So I bought this because it was on sale with the 20 dollars off deal and didn't actually expect to enjoy the milk. I bought the regular milk and this chocolate. Well, I'm pleasantly surprised to say it actually does taste great. The milk does have a very very slight different taste from milk you would get in your supermarket, but in no way does that take away from the milk. I drunk it when it was over room temp and then when it was cool. It tasted better cold, but it wasn't bad warmer either. So I guess Horizon can consider me a convert to their milk and I will certainly buy again before the sale is off. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Something's Changed with Canidae food,1,"I fed and recommended this food for several years as one of the best dry foods available. However, over the last few months (late 2007) something has changed. My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it. Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped. I tried another bag last week-- same results. Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months. No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners. Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address. I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems. I've changed my dogs to Eagle Pack Holistic Selects. It's more expensive, but they are back to their old selves-- healthy, no digestive troubles, and great coats. …",15 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Not recommended after they changed their formula,5,"I started feeding my dogs Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food almost 5 years ago. Prior to that I used NutroMax. Wow, what an amazing food. My german shepherd and 2 golden retrievers have the most incredible coats. Their poops are firm (and easy to pick up) and nearly odorless. No allergies either, unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems. I've convinced one person to change to Canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it. I buy it locally as I go thru 40 pounds every 3 weeks (feeding 3 large dogs). I highly recommend this food, could not be happier. Update: Canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late 2008 and at the same time, in order to save money, changed their formulas. Added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and GI problems. The organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about Canidae than any manufacturer in recent history, due to their formula change. A fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about 50% of the Canidae bags back from owners w/ pets having problems w/ the new formula. All 3 of my dogs had bad reactions, and I even did a gradual change over because I was told ahead of time (by my friend) that they changed the formula. Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, scratching. My one golden scratched himself raw to the point I had to take him to the vet. After using Canidae for many years, and recommending it to many others, I decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it. I switched to using California Natural Lamb and Rice and Orijen Adult, two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available. Both company control the ingredients, manufacture the food, have numerous quality checkpoints, and do their own distribution. My dogs are different ages and have different needs so I do a blend of the CalNat and Orijen and WOW, what a difference. Their coats are shiny, their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free. And they love it! Both are great foods, a bit more expensive than other foods but to me, worth every penny. Cal Nat and Orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion. If you are considering Canidae, I'd recommend you look at Cal Nat or Orijen instead. New Rating: Canidae - 0 stars California Natural - 5 stars Orijen - 5 stars (I'd give Orijen 10 stars if I could, it really is that good). …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
