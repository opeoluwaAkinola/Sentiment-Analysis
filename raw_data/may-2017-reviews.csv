 Can't Beat Nutiva's Organic Coconut Oil for Taste or Texture,5,"I first tried coconut oil last fall after reading The Coconut Oil Miracle (***highly recommended book***) and Nutiva's Organic Coconut Oil was the first I tried. It spoiled me completely. I've since tried two other brands and NOTHING tastes as fresh and light as this oil. It has a nice coconut flavor and personally, I love the taste it gives fried eggs and even pancakes. I also used it to make a pie crust (after chilling the oil slightly to compensate for the friction of working the pie crust) for a coconut cream pie and it was out of this world--flaky and delicious!!! Like another poster, I also like it spread on a toasted English muffin and then topped with a light drizzle of honey. Our family has changed our eating habits in the last year and now we use only 3 fats: 1. Coconut Oil 2. Butter 3. Extra Virgin Olive Oil (but only raw---never with heat!!!!--use the coconut oil or butter for fried & sauteed foods). Our general health is much improved; my husband's cholesterol levels are finally dropping (after YEARS of using ""SmartBalance"" and other ""healthy"" spreads that just raised his cholesterol). Try this coconut oil and do yourself a favor and order Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil) so you can understand why it not only tastes so good, but is so good for you! …",48 out of 50 users found this review helpful
 Gave my son back his Valentine's Day fun...,5,"Valentine's Day is the hardest day of the year for my 9-year-old. He has a sensitivity to red dye 40. Almost all the candy you buy has it in it. M&Ms have it - IN THE CHOCOLATE. Most chocolate cake mixes have it, but worse... all that red candy you get from your classmates? Yeah... it has it too. Luckily, his sister will usually trade him for things that he can have and the families that we know will try to make sure he gets something (like one specifically got green fun dip for him - I mean, how sweet is that?). We always give away little party favor toys or something and skip the candy all together, but... He had been really down about the candy issue and Valentine's Day and I went looking for something he could have. Surely, there's a red hard candy that doesn't have red40 in it, right? Yeah, you'd be surprised... it's not easy to find, but I ran across this product and ordered it. As a bonus, it has a good chunk of Vitamin C, doesn't use HFCS (all natural sugars and other ingredients). Sold! But, will it be nasty? Oh well, we had 150 lollipops to find out! ... and they are good. REALLY good, they are just the right amount of sweet and tartness. I had to move them off the counter because I kept dipping in there myself. My son LOVES them. He can have strawberry flavored candy again. I know this sounds simplistic and overly dramatic, but when you are 9, it can be really depressing. But yeah, he has to share with the rest of the family too because we are all hooked. Thanks, YummyEarth. Thanks for giving my son back his Valentine's Day :) Note: The container we got only had 3 flavors in it, but it didn't matter, but be aware when ordering that your selection of flavors will vary. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Tasty but Burnt and Salty,2,"OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty. They also have a burnt flavor. You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order. On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good. This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags). Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Superstore! …",29 out of 37 users found this review helpful
 Natural Calm Magnesium,5,"I have used this product before in the calcium/magnesium blend. It was suppose to be tasteless. It wasn't. It tastes awful. This lemon-raspberry tastes okay and the product is more reactive when the hot water is added. I was medically advised to take my magnesium in this form because of slipped disks in my back. This is only one piece of my back program however I can attest to the efficacy of the product. My disks are no longer slipped. It has helped me to heal. A bonus benefit for me is that taking the magnesium in this form has stopped the migraines that I have had for 36 years of my life. I have learned that if a headache begins that I need a dose of Natural Calm. I was dealing with a magnesium deficiency. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with muscle or joint issues, migraines,and back issues.

 My Dog Loves This Food,4,"I have a 12 year old golden retriever. I have been feeding him Happy Hips treats for almost a year hoping the glucosamine helps with his arthritis. He eats the treats like crazy. I like the fact they are apple, banana, chicken and sweet potato. They are healthier than store bought treats. I have the same hope for the chicken & oats dry dog food. This dog food came the other day, I cut the bag open to dump it into a plastic tub and by mistake I tipped it over a little and some of it went scattered all over the floor. Well, my dog with the arthrtis jumped right up and cleaned up the floor in no time, tried sticking his head in the bag and then wagged his tale licking my face. If this is as good as the treats, I know it will help with his arthritis. Superstore is the cheapest I have found for this food, plus the free shipping is a bonus. I bought mine when Superstore had a 20 percent promotion so it was an added bonus. Thanks Dogswell and Superstore. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

This is now my beverage of choice after I wake up in the early morning and after a hard workout on the road or gym.

 Dishonest Product,1,"Bragg markets this product as ""no salt added"" and ""Healthier than soy"" while she herself advocates raw and natural food. This product is made by chemically processing ""liquid soy protein"" in a way that chemically creates table salt and strips glutamic acids from the soy proteins, creating MSG. Naturally fermented soy sauce starts with the same base, is obviously fermented rather than chemically processed, does add salt but is able to use healthier salt than the chemically made salt in Bragg's, keeps the glutamic acids bonded to the protein, boasts the same assortment of amino acids, and doesn't cost any more than Bragg's. In short, Bragg is hypocritically marketing a product with no advantages over a good-quality soy sauce. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Dog food that even the pickiest dog (and owner!) will love,5,"Natural Balance Ultra Premium Formula for Dogs is the only dog food I'll now give to my pups. I have a picky-eating Jack Russell who also suffers from skin allergies. I tried multiple different brands and types of foods before finding Natural Balance- it's the only dog food that he instantly loved, and continues to eat (bag after bag after bag!). The food is high quality and the bags rarely come with pieces crumbled in the bottom. The premium formula has helped cure my Jack Russell's skin problems, and keeps his coat shiny. I also give the Natural Balance Ultra Premium Reduced Calorie Formula to my just-slightly-over-weight Boston Terrier. While feeding her the same quantity of food, she's been able to loose 2lbs in a month. Natural Balance is a fabulous dog food brand- get it for your dogs, they'll love you for it!! …",29 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 Menopause Relief,5,I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep. I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately. I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes. I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink. I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much. …,16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Gold standard...Years of research on my part...,5,"When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my ""baby"" each day. Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life... I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption. I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me) At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud. Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods. The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label. Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this! Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic. I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about. Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out... (p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them! But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!) So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.) Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest... if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal. This is hard to find. So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet. He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!) I, personally, have helped friends CURE ""health"" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept ""treating"" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and ""cured"" them! Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both. I am a raving fan. and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it. …",119 out of 120 users found this review helpful
 Tastes great ... and gets 2-year-old approval,5,"These multrigrain chips taste like restaurant-quality corn tortilla chips, but they come in individual-sized bags. Most importantly, my two-year-old daughter (who is so picky she hardly eats anything) absolutely LOVES these chips. These chips are technically ""multigrain"" because they contain yellow corn, brown rice flour, flax seeds, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and soy flour. However, stone ground yellow corn is clearly the main ingredient in these chips and you'll have a hard time picking up the flavor of the other ingredients with your taste buds. The other thing I really like about these chips is that they're flavored with sea salt, which is lower in sodium and (in my opinion) tastes better than regular table salt. With only 140 calories per bag and 7 grams of fat it's hard not to say yes to this tasty treat. Overall, I highly recommend these chips! …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what's on the label.,1,"According to an article on CNN on 8/5/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the lable.

 Another great dark K-cup coffee,4,"I love the rich, full-bodied flavor of a dark-roast coffee. When I bought my first Keurig machine I wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast K-cups that I could find. I initially settled on Newman's Own Dark Roast as my ""go-to"" coffee, but I didn't stop there. I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new. I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away. It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it. Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try. Here is my impression of it: After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story. It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness. I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People's Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand. However, I will keep looking for something new. Who knows what I will find?

And, best of all, no more itching or hot spots. Vet believes that she was allergic to corn products in Iams; a common allergy for dogs.

" Raw  -NOT Mushy, Very Nutritious & Delicious!",5,"I was originally hesitant to try these given the mixed reviews. I really love buckwheat and use it in a variety of different ways including as a hot morning cereal, fresh ground for homemade bread and pancakes (nothing beats fresh ground buckwheat flour made into pancakes with 100 wholesome maple syrup) and even in a type of pilaf. After re-reading a few things it appears there are some misconceptions about this product... 1. - This is indeed raw and whole grain groats. If you are searching for roasted/toasted buckwheat you need to keep searching. If you are searching for partially ground, flaked, rolled, etc you also need to keep looking. For those that are familiar with Kasha - this is not roasted nor partially broken...when cooked it will turn into little round **** rather like tapioca. 2. Not mushy...try this a few times to get the cooking correct. I eat this for breakfast with a little honey several times per week and it is excellent. No gluten, lots of nutrition including most essential amino acids, very little fat/calories...it's nearly the perfect food. Bring the water to a boil, put in the groats, reduce the heat and allow to simmer for a few minutes. Keep an eye on it - the buckwheat will ""puff"" and become soft. After a few attempts you will learn to recognize the preferred consistency that suites you best. 3. Superb nutrition & versatile. Buckwheat should be considered a super-food it's so nutritious without all the other garbage. It's also incredibly versatile - from a hot breakfast cereal (boil and use a touch of honey) to fresh ground for bread (bread makers, use about 1:4 ratio with fresh ground whole wheat...since this has no gluten the wheat will allow it to rise while the buckwheat adds essential nutrients the wheat lacks. For those with a gluten intolerance, buckwheat is a superb alternative and can be used to create bread without any gluten but you will need to use an enhancer to help it rise. …",74 out of 75 users found this review helpful
 Fantastic Real Licorice From The Land Down Under,5,"I recently purchased a bag of Kookaburra Black Licorice at Target (of all places) Real licorice lovers in US know how difficult it to find REAL black licorice here, so I was delighted to find this product at a retail store AND at my fave online store.

" This is ""the one""",5,"I have been taste-testing so many brands and roasts of k-cups to determine our favorites that I feel like a 'lab rat.' The Tully's Italian Roast immediately stood out from the rest--love at first sip! The other reviews are accurate by describing it as aromatic, smooth and flavorful, not bitter nor weak. I make my first cup of the morning by using one k-cup on the large cup setting, then I make my add'l cups of coffee using one k-cup and a combination of both the middle and smallest cup; that way I get more coffee using one K-cup.

 Dog likes them!,3,"My dog likes these treats, but definitely prefers the peanut butter ones better. One strange thing I've noticed with these treats is that they tend to harden very quickly -- so you're best off buying the small bag (seen here), not the bigger bag. It's strange -- the salmon flavor does harden faster than the peanut butter flavor. But, all in all, they're a good treat to feed your dog because they're so small. They're perfect for training, and Zuke's is always full of good things, not some crappy ingredients like some other dog treats out there. …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Good Product and Excellent Customer Service,5,"At first, we did not get along. It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements. Good coarse grind, check. No grounds around lid before closing, check. Not too full, check. Seated properly in Keurig, check. My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help. I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews. The next morning, we tried something different. We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine. That helped, a lot. The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine. Perfection! I cannot explain why, but it worked. I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail! We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean. We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank. Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug. …",88 out of 88 users found this review helpful

 Vegan Natural Kosher Choice,5,"Vegan. Natural. Kosher parve. Sunflowers are so beautiful. Sunflower seeds are a joy. German whole grain bread. Moist. Hearty. Flavorful. Great with soup, or a salad, for veggie sandwiches with dressing, or with your favorite jam or marmalade. Or just plain to enjoy the moist whole grain German flavor right from the vacuum sealed package. Slices can also be cut into squares for making your favorite appetizers. Made with whole kernal rye, wholemeal rye flour, sunflower seeds, salt, oat fiber, and yeast. Long shelf life. My order has 10 months left on the suggested use by date. Pre-sliced. 7 slices (the long way) per loaf. One long slice can be cut in half for two square pieces for one sandwich. 140 calories, 5g protein, 6g fiber per slice.

 A Passion for Vanilla,5,"Superior vanilla beans come from the Madagascar ""Bourbon Islands,"" Mexico and Indonesia. I find the flavor was truly superior to normal vanilla extract. While you don't want to use vanilla beans in everything (too expensive!), you will definitely want to consider using them in custards and when you make ice cream. Vanilla enhances everything from creamy porridges to custards and cakes. The list goes on and on. There are so many uses for vanilla. Vanilla is derived from the seductively aromatic vanilla bean. Vanilla beans are actually the cigar-shaped seed pod from a fragrant climbing orchid native to tropical America. Yes, vanilla extract is much more economical, but using vanilla beans is rather gourmet. The extract is created from chopped vanilla beans that are soaked in an alcohol/water solution. It takes about 100 beans to make 1 gallon of extract. You can use the vanilla beans, rinse and dry them, so they last longer. After drying, you can store them again in the glass tube or in their own plastic bag for reuse. ~The Rebecca Review …",7 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Absolutely the Best,5,"If you're used to those best-selling boxed raisins that feature a health woman happily working in the fields, get real, and then get Newman's Organic Raisins. These may be the best-tasting grocery raisins you've ever had. Nothing even approaches these for their flavor, texture, and all those Newman Company extras that aficionados like me adore. (We're talking organic ingredients, environmentally sound production, profits donated to the needy, and supporting the goals of one of the most compelling actors of all time, and a heck of a nice guy as well.) But back to the food at hand. These are plump, JUICY raisins, startlingly different from the usual fare. I don't know how they do it, but Newman's Organic California Raisns retain their natural flavor; pleasant scent, and a succulent mouth feel that one expects from fine port. One ""secret"" may be the ingredients: Raisins. C'est tout. Make that ingredient, in fact. THe only thing missing is Newman's usual story on the package--usually some wild, adventurous story shedding light on the product, and featuring Mr. Newman as raconteur-narrator.

 Based on beef being grass fed however . . .,5,"the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately I'm unable to review the flavor as I forgot I can't have beef anymore (due to health issues). Ingredients: beef, flavoring supplement (salt, dextrose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, spices, spice extractives, soybean oil), vinegar, brown sugar, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices Here is some info found on the internet: Maltodextrin ~ maltodextrin from corn or soy can be very unsafe/poison for anyone. As all GMO products like corn and soy are genetically engineered from the monsanto company. they insert a bacteria in all GMO products, and this changes the natural organic developing of corn or soy. do not buy anything that contains maltodextrin or titanium for your own health. Maltodextrin made in the US is made from corn. Corn in the US is a GMO food so Maltodextrin as derived from a Gmo is extremely unsafe. Soy ~ this particular info from: (...) . . .fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits. Fermented soy does not wreak havoc on your body like unfermented soy products do. Here is just a sampling of the health effects that have been linked to unfermented soy consumption: *Breast cancer *Brain damage *Infant abnormalities *Thyroid disorders *Kidney stones *Immune system impairment *Severe, potentially fatal food allergies *Impaired fertility *Danger during pregnancy and nursing and for all ~ Jesus Christ (Yahushua HaMashiach) is coming back. Don't leave this world without Him... Gift of God With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news. It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world. Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God. The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God. The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction. Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc. The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever? Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God. God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven? My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight! It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him! Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death. Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ! Yahushua loves you! …",3 out of 38 users found this review helpful

 Retro Candy baskets make a unique gift for any occasion...one sure to bring back the memories,5,"Have you ever been walking and heard a song on the radio and remembered something you thought long forgotten? Have you ever smelled something cooking that reminded you of growing up? Have you ever seen something that is so symbolic that you are transported back in mind? Our five senses are the strongest triggers of memory that we as humans possess, and this Retro Candy basket from the 1970's takes full advantage of that to make a perfect gift for the person who has every gadget, trinket, and item they ever needed. Growing up in the 1970s (warning retro alert) I can remember going to the candy store and picking up some of the items in this basket. Laffy taffy, SO good, bubble gum cigs(probably not the best choice since I later smoked) Lemon and Cherry heads, and of course my personal favorite, Razzles! This basket has it all, and just reading the candy names sent me into a fit of nostalgia.

 deadly,1,"1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous and Deadly, May 25, 2006 I have two beagles who love to chew, and greenies are highly compressed which woule make it a good optionfor my dogs. However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any. It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse. If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a ""busy ball"". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy **** let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety. If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie. Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly. While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies. I am actually surprised Superstore even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to Superstore users to petition them to stop selling it. …",1 out of 32 users found this review helpful

" Excellent brew, economical too!",5,"With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time. Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?). I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig. It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well. I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags. This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup). Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here. Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like. Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there. Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder. Ok, on to the the ekobrew. They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing. The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds. Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew. I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill. I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter. Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper. I'll be looking into getting another one of these! …",44 out of 45 users found this review helpful
 Great all natural long lasting entertainment!,5,"I am now on my third package of Himilayan dog chews from Superstore. They are amazing and you can't beat the free shipping from the suppliers on Superstore! My search for a long lasting chew started when our lab/doberman puppy was only about 3-4 months old. I had read so many good things about bully sticks so I ordered them and then just about threw up when I smelled them! I tried to look over it, gave it to our pup (who loved it) but then not only did it smell while he was eating it, but his breath was stinky for a while afterwards! Plus, I'd say the bully stick didn't seem to last much longer than a regular (non-stinky) rawhide. Then I ordered the Himilayan dog chew. He wasn't sure how to approach it since it is literally rock hard. But, then he started scrapping it with his teeth. He isn't the type of dog to take big bites so he's never gotten any big hunks off of it. One chew last weeks since we usually save it for an after dinner snack/entertainment (1-2 hours at a time). Not only does the Himalyan dog chew last a really long time, it also barely smells at all unless you hold it to your nose! And, at that, it's just a smoked gouda type smell so it's not repulsive like a bully stick. Plus, it seems to keep our pups breath smelling much better than if he doesn't have it! We had actually taken a Himalayan dog chew with us on a road trip to my parents house and their dog (9 year old lab mix) actually snuck into our bag and stole the cheese! This is actually a very surprising thing because their dog has NEVER been a chewer. If given something hard, she actually just hides it and never eats it. So, to see her take the cheese and bite small pieces off, I knew she must have loved it! On our next visit I made sure to have an extra piece of cheese just for her. Needless to say, I cannot recommend trying this out enough! If it ends up your dog didn't like it, you just tried one more item in an attempt to make them happy. If they love it though, you will have found a great investment in your dogs health and happiness! Our pup LOVES his cheese! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Impossible To Spread On Bread,1,"I feel the Tuscan Milk jokes starting all over again...(as if they ever stopped!) Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz Wow! Thought this would be the way to go-not only save money on lunches, but to keep it a long time without spoilage. I couldn't wait to get my peanut butter-had the jelly and bread just a-waitin', but low and behold, when I tried to spread it on the bread-yuck-wouldn't even adhere to the knife out of the jar! Next, I tried shaking it from the jar onto the bread, but when I picked the bread up, it fell clean off. Someone suggested I put the jelly on first, but when I did that then stuck the knife into the jar, all I ended up with was a messy knife-still wouldn't spread. I finally gave up and just opened my mouth, put my head back and dumped the stuff directly onto my awaiting tastebuds. On the second attempt, I somehow bypassed the tastebuds and it went directly into my throat where it strangled me. I'd tell this story verbally, but I am now unable to speak because it ate out my vocal cords. So much for convenience. …",5 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 So far,3,"This is my 55th wine kit and my second all juice kit. At this point, the kit has been made and bottled-after bulk aging a couple of months. The inside of the kit reminds me of a Mosti Mondiale all juice kit. The instructions were fine. The instructions also reminde me of the Mosti Mondaile all juice kit I have made. The look of the juice was lighter than what I'm used to seeing in an Amarone kit. I'm wondering if this going to be the weight of a Pinot Noir. This kit did not come with any crushed grape pack so I added a used one to increase the solids/weight of the wine...so now the kit is bottle aging. I'll try a bottle at about 6 months of age---which puts it at the beginning of June. Stay tuned. …",10 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Great healing properties for burns and cuts!,5,"I have used this Manuka Honey for various types of degree burns. Burns heal, faster, cleanly and leave less scarring. I also used it on a really bad laceration and crushed finger tip that was almost cut off from a door. The price might be a little expensive, but its well worth the price for the healing properties this awesome medical grade honey has. Look for either the MGO 400 or its equivalent UMF 20+. This type of honey is not like table honey, it a powerful honey that is only found and created in New Zealand has great antimicrobial, anti-fungus, antibacterial, antiviral, antibiotic and antiseptic properties. It can also be used for acne, skin disorders, and is safe for use in infections in the eye socket, nasal cavity, and ear cavity. It may be taken orally to provide great health for your digestive system and overall health. Do your own research and be patient, and you will see its great healing benefits.

" Expensive, but my cat is thriving on it",5,"I decided to switch my cat's food because she was having all kinds of problems: excessive throwing up, urinary tract issues, and significant weight loss that the vet couldn't explain. I switched her from Kirkland dry and Friskies Turkey Pate canned to Wellness dry and Wellness chicken formula, and it's been almost an overnight miracle. She's put on at least a pound in 3 weeks (she eats an entire 5.5 oz can plus dry food every day--no more pushing the food around and not really eating), no more straining on the litter box, and she hasn't barfed in over a week!

 Are you ready?,4,"There are two kinds of people in this world. If you are reading this you are the second type. The first type of person would not be wasting time reading reviews. They would have ordered a case or two of these peppers already and be on to doing something exciting and awesome like filming a new Mountain Dew commercial. We have established that you are the second type of person, the one who chooses between hamburger helper and ramen noodles. The one who knows how to casserole a can of tuna about a dozen ways. The one who thinks that spaghetti sauce comes in a jar. But you can be the first type of person. What you have been missing all this time is SPICE. These peppers deliver SPICE. Smokey, rich, and able to deliver just the right amount of heat. I love chipotle peppers, and this deal can't be beat. I love this brand and the price is about half what I pay per can at my local grocer. In addition to any Mexican-style food, I add them to chili, pizza, beef or pork roast, omeletts, and many other items. Mix a little of the adobo sauce with some apricot jam and use it as a glaze for fish on the grill (yum!). Get a little crazy.

 The Cheesiest.,5,"As I sit here, with a mouth full of this fine Kraft product, I can't help but remember that fateful December afternoon. The war had ended some time ago, yet you could still hear the resentment resonating through the townsfolk's gnashed teeth. Jake and I were at the bar, as usual, trying to drink away the sun. The barkeep, sliding a filthy rag across the counter, squinted as he tried to read our shirts. He let a grin escape and shook his head. ""You got a problem, old man?"" Jake took off his glasses. The barkeep ran his forearm across his wrinkled face. ""Ain't no problem here. You boys have guts, is all, wearin' those Kraft logos around these parts. This is a Stouffer's county."" Jake stood up, sliding his stool back across the hardwood floor. ""If I wanted to choke down frozen food, I'd move my **** to Alaska. I'll take The Cheesiest any day."" We used to call him Jake the Patriot. Always looking for a fight. I grabbed his arm in a vain attempt to pacify him. Looking around the room, I saw we were vastly outnumbered. ""Choose your next words carefully, son. Don't look like you're makin' many friends here."" The bar patrons began edging closer to us. There was a wild look in their eyes; the kind that only came from malnutrition. I felt a moment of pity for them. Who could deny the inherent benefits of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese? Jake discreetly slipped brass knuckles on underneath the counter. ""You heard me."" He turned, addressing the whole room. ""Stouffer's is garbage."" The patrons exploded. Frozen bricks of macaroni were tossed at us. We fought off near twenty men, leaving each one with regret. Jake turned back to the barkeep, spitting blood onto the floor. ""That, old man, is why Kraft will always win."" As we walked out, stepping over the injured men on the ground, the old man called after us. ""You boys forgot one thing."" He walked to the back-room door. ""Mastodons love Stouffer's."" He flung open the door and dove under the bar. A giant mastodon crashed through the frame, charging directly at us. I luckily threw myself out of the way. Jake, the poor kid, was not so fortunate. I watched in horror as the giant animal gored him with its tusks. It dropped Jake, looked around, and walked out as quickly as it came. I ran over to Jake's body, crying out. He looked up at me, his life slowly slipping away. ""Keep up the good fight, buddy. Never forget what Stouffer's has done to me. Tell the world."" He was gone. Since that day, a rage has been building inside me. This injustice cannot be forgiven. I call upon all of you to eat the delicious Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in memory of Jake. Tell your friends. As you're stirring The Cheesiest cheese into boiled macaroni, just think. One day, we will be able to live without fear of the Stouffer's Mastodon. …",157 out of 182 users found this review helpful

It's got a great mix of vitamins and minerals that really do make it a meal in a glass.

 Be sure to order appropriate size,4,"I am obsessed with researching stuff and I was nervous about ordering such a spendy dog toy. I am very happy I did! I originally purchased a small for my 10 lb wire fox terrier puppy (chews on EVERYTHING-he's teething), after getting it home I realized how some folks would have problems w/their dog popping out the treats too fast. IMO, order the largest size your dog can have fun with. I exchanged the small for a medium and it's worked out great. This way, he can't get his jaws around it and he can't pop the treats out-he just licks it to death, rolls it everywhere and growls at it b/c he can't get to the treats-which is the whole point of the toy. Like the reviewers before-know your dog and order bigger. I have also read that you can put the refill treats in upside down to make it more difficult.

 Affordable Fun for your Dog!,4,"I have a golden retriever as well as a pembroke welsh corgi. They love their food and tend to inhale it. But they are also very smart and tend to get board. I bought the Star Spinner as well as the paw print shaped toy by this same company and they had a blast from the moment I filled it and set it on the floor! I love that the toys are plastic. So they are much easier to clean (just spray and rinse in the sink, or wipe out with a clorox wipe). Particularly since my corgi prefers soft/moist treats as compared to my dry kibble loving golden. I bought this for roughly $20 at my local canine specialty store, which is far more affordable than the ""name brand"" products. And since I worry about the bacterial growth on the far more expensive wooden models, the easy to clean and disinfect plastic one has been perfect for us. Safety Note: as with ANY dog toy, please supervise your dog while using. Their ""drive"" will be increased while playing with the toy, and with the paw print model with the removable cups, don't let your dog chew on the cups, but redirect him to the treat inside the dish after he pulls out the cup. My golden retriever loves it so much that I now use it to give him his kibble every day! Which is much safer as the bigger dogs tend towards bloat, which can kill your dog. This allows him to have fun while eating tiny amounts of kibble at a time. Win,Win! …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Watch that shipping charge for multiple items!,2,"If you order more than one of these Equal sweetener tablet dispensers, BE AWARE that while they are all shipped in a single package with negligible weight [** even ==10== of these dispensers would not weigh more than a half-pound, if even that!], you will be charged $1.99 shipping and handling for EACH DISPENSER in your multiple dispenser order! I wrote to the seller about this matter and through Superstore but I did not receive a response from the seller. In my case, I ordered 6 Equal dispensers which amounts to $17.34 but then I was charged $11.94 for shipping [$1.99 for 'each' dispenser] even though they were shipped together in a single package with very negligible package weight. I asked the seller to perhaps consider [no matter who orders the product] a more reasonable [read: equitable] shipping and handling charge based on the actual weight of the package and the fact that the multiple item order is shipped in one single package, but as I said, and to date, I received no response from the seller. So too, various of these dispensers have tablet jamming problems and you've got to often bang on the thing to get the small tablet out in one piece. Further, it's difficult to find these tablet dispensers in supermarkets, the why of which escapes me, but when they first came out, the dispenser had a small lid on the bottom and the tablets came out intact and freely but when the Equal folks moved to the newer tablet 'click' dispensers, the tablet jamming became a problem and this 'may' account for the Equal folks going with the sweetener 'granule' or sweetener 'powder' packets for their sweetener vs the hard tablet dispensers. I think charging $1.99 for 'each' dispenser but which is shipped in a 'single' package borders on shipping and handling fee inequity. In the future, I'll simply order the dispensers one by one and 'then' I can at least justify the seller shipping and handling charge even though I'll wind up paying the same but it would then have to be sent in multiple packages! I think the seller would do much better in 'adjusting' the shipping fee for multiple item orders that they mail out in one package and based on true mailing weight considerations.

 Fantastic stuff at a great price,5,"Citric acid is one of those incredibly useful items to have on hand. I use it mainly for cleaning tasks such as: > cleaning coffee machines - works much better than vinegar at removing hard water deposits. > cleaning hot water pots - as above. Much easier and less smell than using vinegar. > cleaning dishwashers - add a couple of tablespoons and run the dishwasher through a cycle when it is empty. Makes the interior sparkle like new. > boosting dishwasher detergent performance - add a small amount (about a teaspoon or less) to dishwasher detergent. Really boosts the cleaning power and eliminates hazy dishes. Be careful not to use too much, however, since it can pit delicate glass or metal. > cleaning steam cleaners, steam mops and irons - gets all the crud out. Basically, this is the best cleaner for anything that is affected by hard water deposits. You can buy commercial products such as Cleancaf or other similar cleaners, but the main active ingredient is citric acid. You can get it bulk at a fraction of the cost. The only downside is that this comes packaged in a thin plastic sack. The first thing you'll want to do is transfer it to a plastic container with a tight fitting lid. Makes it much easier to store and use. Regardless of the container, citric acid clumps up easily when there's humidity in the air, but that does not affect its performance. Just bust up the clump and you're good to go. The shelf life is indefinite when you use it as a cleaning product. Highly recommend. …",45 out of 53 users found this review helpful
 These are better than the dried strawberries I make (and those are good too),5,"I do know how to dry strawberries. These, however, are better- okay, MUCH better. However, I want to warn potential buyers of possible disappointment when you open the can. In my canister, the strawberries took up about 1/2 the can. It was not filled to the top. Now, take a look at the price. These are NOT cheap. However, I am ordering two more of these. Why? For several reasons. They keep indefinitely, even after being opened. However, they don't last long in our household so I need to have some hidden in our pantry. Also, what if the power went out. What if your frozen or fresh strawberries weren't available? These have plenty of Vitamin C per serving (60% of the DV which I believe is Daily Value) and only 15 calories per 1/4 cup. Those who have ALLERGIES (yes, I'm capping that) should be aware that they are made on equipment that could also be used to process soy, wheat, egg, peanut and tree nuts. Anyway, These are just perfect for snacks, eating directly from the can, reconstituting (add water) and using in baking, sprinkling over cereal or adding to recipes.

 Superb soup that you can change umpteen times just by adding good things you like!,4,"I must admit that I didn't read enough to know what this soup would be like. What I mean is that I didn't really go through the product description as closely as I should have. I expected this to have a lot of dehydrated veggies in it, but alas--no such luck! That, however, is my deal, not the manufacturers. This soup is mostly lentils, peas, and veggie pasta. Not a terrible combo, really. In fact, it's pretty delicious. When I saw the first bag I pulled out of the box, I thought, ""oh, no. I'm going to have to WORK to make this soup taste good."" I was wrong. Last night, I opened the first bag up and made a delicous soup with just the ingredients in the bag, some chopped garlic, some leftover sauteed chicken, and a chopped tomato. Talk about yummy! It was hearty, ""clean"" tasting soup. By that I mean that the flavors didn't glom up and become one huge mess. I could taste the lentils, the barley, the peas. And the chicken, which I used very little of, was enough to flavor the broth a bit. It was really the one tomato and the garlic that made everything come together, so my advice to you is to go crazy with what you add. My next batch will be made with onion/veggie stock and zucchini, carrots, and a bit of chopped spinach. I can't wait! …",57 out of 59 users found this review helpful

 Ethical eating without compromise,5,"I was sent a box of Uncle Eddie's by my young niece, a convert to veganism after a recent - and by all accounts, traumatic - school trip to the local abattoir. Not being of the vegan persuasion myself, I was unaccustomed to animal-free comestibles. The chewiness of the cookies was surprisingly pleasant, although they definitely lacked the flavour of their traditionally-made cookie cousins due to the absence of butter and other ethically-incorrect animal ingredients. Happily this minor disappointment was easily remedied by immersing the cookies in a shallow bath of warmed lard prior to ingestion. Personally, I prefer the fuller flavour of unrendered lard (obtained from the fatty deposits surrounding the pig's kidneys) but feel sure that the cheaper varieties made from the hard fat between the back skin and the flesh of the pig will suffice for people with less refined palates. By following my advice for post-production animal fat insertion, you can now guzzle guilt-free without compromising on the flavour. …",29 out of 50 users found this review helpful
 Beware of this product--one of our dogs died.,1,"You should monitor your dog very carefully if you give him/her these chews. One of our dogs died as a result of eating these chews, and the other three were very ill for two days. This product is very difficult for dogs to digest and can result in blocked intestines and infection. Since the package did not contain any warnings, we thought they were harmless. Be very careful if you buy these for your dog. …",5 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Product was bad but customer service was excellent,3,"On 9/9/2011 I order the above product. My daughter and I recently started the Atkins diet, heard wonderful things about it and decided to give it a try. The first jar was wonderful! Creamy, aromatic, flavorful...absolutely devine. I opened the second jar at the beginning of this week and what a disappointment. I'm not sure if the ingredients are cooked but the oil has a burnt horrid taste to it. Before we realized it, we had made a batch of carb-free chocolate candy with cream cheese and coconut frosting, a huge batch of chicken fried in the oil and a huge batch of faux-potatoes using the oil. We had to throw everything away. The taste was atrocious. Everything had a burnt and bitter taste to it. I'm extremely disappointed and according to my 15 year old daughter, they need to hire better quality control employees. I have to post an update to this review because I've been working with a customer service rep today and he has provided fantastic service. He is shipping me, for free, a replacement product as well as some additional free products. I am also sending the remaining jar back to the company, at no cost to me, for additional research. …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Never again,1,"I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch. I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor. Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion. I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away. …",8 out of 14 users found this review helpful

My hydration level from drinking this water exceeds any other kind of water I've ever had, which means I don't need to drink as much water to get the intended result - relief of dryness.

 great product and keeps the body happy,5,"I use this product everyday and I have continued to buy it since I discovered it. I put it with rice milk, or with fruit in a smoothie, etc. If you just put it in water and drink it, then yes it is grainy. I don't do that and don't recommend such. It really helps to balance the blood sugar and keep the body happy. It is satisfying in keeping the appetite down. It keeps my lower tract running well. It is high protein and has carb balance as well. Be sure to add it with something to avoid the gritty taste. It wasn't designed to be drank with just water though a person could do it. I've tried the more expensive Nutiva blends that have flavors added and they are great. Nutiva does a good job in producing healthy products. This particular hemp protein powder is effective and it is the cheapest among the hemp protein lines so I just add my own fruit, maca, etc. If you want to stay economical and add your own blend to it then you have a program that works great. If you want a sweeter taste then buy the other types of Nutiva hemp as they have several great flavors. I highly recommend Nutiva hemp. …",27 out of 28 users found this review helpful

 Numi's Bouquet Tea Set,2,"The tea is not quite what I expected. The ""flowers"" are already opened. Other teas of this type that I have had, have been tightly rolled up and expanded in the hot water to form the flower. That was a let down. The tea its self did have a good flavor. As for the pot, the lid has no catch so you have to try to hold it on when you pour, or it falls off (usually into the cup and splashes). The pot gets VERY HOT and is hard to hold - especially the lid. On the whole, I was very disappointed with this set. I would not recommend it to others. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Caribou Pulls a Fast One on Loyal Customers,1,"I've been drinking Caribou Blend for years and it is just right for my taste... or at least it was. Got a new shipment in and I noticed a color change on the K-cup, orange to light green. Uh-oh, wrong product? I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change. My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad. I would have gladly paid more for my favorite. The new blend is far inferior. If you're a regular, have someone brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference. Time for a new favorite with a company that doesn't play sleazy tricks on its loyal customers. If and when prices return to normal, watch the return to the old orange based on ""we listen to our customers"" and more corporate-speak BS. …",21 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 I'd give it 6 stars !,5,"Dark Muscovado sugar is fabulous ! It's important to note that it is absolutely necessary to store it in a sealed plastic or glass container so it doesn't turn into a sugar boulder. Bought this sugar on a whim thinking it MIGHT be good and it certainly looked like something a different than you'd ever find in a supermarket. What a thrill it is. Granted, the packaging is plain, nothing at all fancy about it but what's inside is very fancy with a flavor so divine that it invites you to try it in everything. Here are a few of the things I've used it for since it arrived in my kitchen. Adds an elegant, gourmet flavor when used as a topping on french toast. On hot cereals such as oatmeal, cream of wheat, cream of rice it tastes rich and the steam rising smells so good. And here's a news flash: Mix a rounded teaspoon or two in hot or cold milk for a real treat. Or if you're like me and into making from scratch hot cocoa, instead of mixing granulated sugar into the cocoa powder mix about 1/2 as much Muscovado sugar for an out of this world cup of hot cocoa. The flavor is deep and heady with an aroma that will knock your socks off. Want to add some pizazz to your beef stew? Add a half teaspoon of Muscovado to it about 1/2 hour before it's finished cooking. It also will add great flavor to chili when you add teaspoon full to it near the end of it's cooking time. Cut up a few apples, an orange and add a 1/2 cup or so of dried cranberries and a handful of crushed walnuts or pecans, sprinkle a rounded teaspoon of Muscovado sugar on top and give it a light toss. Let the mix sit in the fridge for an hour or so and you have a grand fresh dessert OR - and let me tell you this is so good you'll want to do it again....instead of serving that mixture cold (it's winter here), pour it all in a sauce pan and simmer it until the apples are soft. Serve it warm. OMG! it's good. I've also tried the warm mix with a splash of Peach Schnapps and a dollop of whipped cream added right before serving and the flavor blew me away. All of our dinner guests have given it rave reviews. The next thing I'm going to try it in is whipped cream - I'll come back and let you know how that goes. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 This one supplement has changed my life!,5,"I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.) None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life. That is, until Natural Calm. This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically! Here are the things this supplement has helped with: Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night. Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations. Mood--- Made me generally happier. Decreased muscle cramping and soreness. Improved gums and teeth. Improved hair loss. Improved digestion and transit time. Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too! But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really. There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Superstore if you want more science of magnesium.) I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement. If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want. Here's wishing you great health! …",219 out of 263 users found this review helpful
" Good, Solid Espresso",5,"Complex, maybe more nasal than some of the coffees I use in my Gaggia Classic. There's almost none of the Ethiopian velvety-slick feel, it's almost all European in taste, meaning the flavor tones are more coffee and less fruit and chocolate, the mouthfeel is clean and not coating/cloying. Great aroma from the crema, and great aftertaste, lasts twenty minutes or more easily. This makes a great straight doubleshot. I don't mix this one with milk/foam, it's good enough on it's own. I never have an issue with grind, pour/pull rate, or crema production. Not overly caffeinated, it doesn't have Robusta, causes very little 'over the temple' headache when overpulled/thin/underdosed, it's pretty temperature-insensitive. While I do appreciate some other coffees with thicker mouthfeel and darker flavors (Klatch Belle Espresso, Black Cat), this coffee is lighter and more 'focused' in flavor than those. I find I pull shots of this LaVazza about twice as often as I pull 'boutique' shots. Just solid coffee, and sets the bar for the standard bean I keep in my kitchen. …",36 out of 37 users found this review helpful

 BEWARE:  MADE IN CHINA,1,"I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so ""addictive."" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is ""decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods."" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats. Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes? Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky? I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring. Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.
