 Half the jar was solidified,2,"I wanted to make some protein bars at home that were lower calorie and didn't have all the fillers, and the recipe called for coconut oil. I used subscribe & save - so it was cheap. I was expecting a glass jar, but was disappointed when it arrived in a plastic jar (BPA, anyone?). From the outside, it looked like the oil had separated and that some had settled in the bottom. When I stuck a spoon in, I found it was hardened/had solidified on the bottom. I was able to break it up into smaller chunks, but it wouldn't dissolve. The oil I was able to get out of it worked, but I'm disappointed with the quality of the one I received. Too cheap to be worth returning. …",1 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Perfect Dog Food,5,"My Pomeranian has a very sensitive digestive system and I could never find a food that I knew would provide him both great nutrition, taste and no allergic reaction. Until this canned food ----- that is. He loves it and it is made so well. You can tell there are no fillers in it by the appearance and texture. In fact, when you read the ingredients there is only Turkey Brown Rice and Vitamins. I encourage anyone who is thinking about ordering this food to give it a try. Your pooch will be glad you did. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 YUUUMMMMMMMMMY,5,"Thanks to our purchase of a Keurig, I am a converted coffee drinker. Timothy's German Chocolate Cake is my absolute favorite.

 Refuting the 2-Star Review.,5,"Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation. So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked ""natural""), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those. Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.

 Good coffee...perhaps bad shipping?,3,"We owned a bed and breakfast for many years and the coffee we used daily was Cafe Bustelo. The flavor was rubust and not bitter...just good coffee that 95% of our guests thoroughly enjoyed. Recently, I ordered 8 packs from Superstore, and only 2 of the 8 arrived in their vacuum brick...the others seemed to have not been sealed well. This had never occurred before. The coffee in the sealed packs is the delicious flavor that is known, but the unsealed packs has given the coffee a bad flavor...who knows how long the vacuum was broken before arriving at our home.

 Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor,4,"To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes. NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words ""Medium Extra Bold"" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Superstore should correct that description and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other. …",454 out of 462 users found this review helpful

" Not the greatest, but not the worst either.",3,"I drink espresso (moka) daily, and go through a 250g/8.8oz brick in about 2 weeks. In my opinion, this isn't the greatest blend from Lavazza that I've had, but it's not the worst coffee I've had either (it definitely beats the drip coffee I'd otherwise get at work). It's a 70/30 robusta/arabica blend, a dark roast with a fruity though noticeably bitter finish (but not as bad as Starbucks or Peet's coffee). The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee. I'd really give it a 2.5 or 3 but then again, all taste is subjective, That being said, this is a reasonable coffee (considering taste vs. price), but I'll probably switch back to my regular (and unfortunately more expensive) blend. …",16 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Never again,1,"I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch. I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor. Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain.

 Cheaper at Walmart,3,"Good stuff....but. I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag). I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Superstore (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors. I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there. (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Superstore about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Superstore plus you have to purchase it in bulk). I find that I tend to order blindly from Superstore when I'm actually purchasing from Superstore and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings. This was a bit of a wake-up call. I will give kudos to Superstore for their customer service policies, though.

" The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization",5,"Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet. Yes they really are that good. I'm not in thrall of the whole ""organic"" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil. The person who came up with this ""red hot"" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented. It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.

 Will NOT fail a drug test,5,"I know a concern of many in consuming hemp oil is failing workplace drug tests. For this reason hemp product manufacturers have started a program called TestPledge to educate consumers in this area. I highly suggest reading this page for an interesting explanation: [...] Briefly outline: TestPledge requires that pledging companies achieve this goal by committing to the following THC limits: * Hemp oil: 5.0 parts per million (ppm) * Hemp nut: 1.5 parts per million (ppm) How much hemp oil and hemp nut can you eat? At the 5 ppm THC TestPledge limit for hemp oil, a person would have to eat in excess of 8 tablespoon servings - half of an 8 oz. bottle - of pure hemp oil per day to ingest 600 µg THC, the dose found not to cause confirmed positive urine tests for marijuana with a wide margin of safety. To increase this margin even further and to address any and all health concerns, setting the daily THC intake at 500 µg per day still allows for slightly over 7 tablespoon servings daily. THC limits for TestPledge were set low enough to allow for the extensive daily consumption of both hemp oil and hemp nut. For example, one can consume 3 tablespoons of hemp oil AND 8.75 ounces (over a half-pound) of hemp nut before reaching the 600 µg daily dose, or 3 tablespoons of hemp oil AND 7 ounces of hemp nut before reaching the more conservative 500 µg daily dose. This example shows that even enthusiastic hemp food consumers will not be able to consume enough hemp nut and oil food products to produce a confirmed positive drug test. It also shows the TestPledge limits are set low enough to provide an ample margin of safety. Nutiva is one of the companies that have taken the pledge that they adhere to the testpledge criteria. …",33 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 Nutritious and... Ropey,1,"As a warning - I am not a vegan, I do not hug trees (though I do love them), and I really am not into the whole organic movement (though I have no problem with it).... If my stance on those three ""issues"" was different, I might love this product... as it is, I found it to be somewhat disgusting. I typically drink Meijer branded chocolate shake mix (Meijer is a western US mega-store & the shake mix is a knock-off of what slimfast puts in a can). I hoped that this mix would taste at least somewhat (even a little bit) like the meijer brand.... The ways that I described this taste to my wife each morning... well, they aren't good... I'm listing a few: - It tasted like rope - It tasted like licking a wet horses bridle - It tasted like sucking the water out of a wet hemp bracelet - It tasted like someone had mixed dirt in with my unsweetened baker's cocoa - It tasted like chewing on tree bark In all seriousness, the ""rope"" & ""wet hemp bracelet"" analogies are the closest... I used to wear a lot of hemp (before doing so was part of the ""organic"" eating movement I guess?)... and I remember chewing on the necklace/bracelets. This product tastes just like that. Another note - I was not impressed by the blending of this stuff. Most shake mixes actually dissolve in liquid; this stuff just sorta clumped into the liquid. On the other hand, I ate (almost) all of it... and it was much more palatable once I mixed it in with the meijer shake mix (2 parts meijer mix, 1 part this stuff). The fiber content is really high (always a plus).. and it was fairly reasonable. So, if you are into the earth loving hipster movement or are just a standard faire hippy - this stuff might be for you. For Joe Six-pack (even the liberal type), this product should probably be avoided. …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Very satisfied with the quality of this tea,5,"I was first introduced to Pu-Ehr tea by a Chinese friend, who told me that most westerners do not like it. After one sip, I agreed with him, and after one cup, I was hooked. That's the way it is with Pu-Ehr tea - initially an acquired taste, then an addiction. This tea is quite a good Pu-Ehr for the price. Some low quality Pu-Ehr tastes very musty and earthy; this does not. I brew one brick in a 22 fluid ounce (0.65 liter), and this yields the entire Pu-Ehr experience. (A can contains 25 bricks.)

 Great creamed coconut; NOT the same as coconut milk,5,"The folks giving bad reviews on this product don't seem to understand that creamed coconut is not the same as condensed coconut milk.

 Best ghee in the world,5,"Ghee is more than an indulgence. Ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement (albeit, one that tastes really good). Ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion, but it can be a healthy addition to any diet. Some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol. I performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available. I compared quality and value. Ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed -- especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used. The ghee comparison table can be found at this blog: [...] When I started this ghee comparison, I was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products. However, I learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards. It was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available. It is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on Superstore . (Ancient Organics Ghee is my #1 pick.) Because such high quality ghees are available, I focused on understanding which product is the most authentic. Some of the ghees are much more authentic than others. The information in the table (link above) reflects that fact. The focus of my evaluation is not gourmet cooking. It is optimum health. Therefore, I am concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest. I rank Ancient Organics as the very best ghee. It is #1. It is the healthiest product as well as the best tasting. The ghee is so good it is almost magical. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" Finally, a great cup of coffee",5,"I have tried them all...all the brands on Superstore, that is. Some have been less than thrilling and some pretty good. The Senseo Espresso Coffee Pods are the best I have found. You can make a great cup of coffee...I wouldn't really call it espresso with the convenience of a pod. I read a tip somewhere on Superstore about wetting both sides of the pod and it was the best tip I got in 2008. The resulting coffee is rich and full flavored, without bitterness. I think I will stick with Senseo Espresso. I did not use the special espresso pod, just the usual one pod holder, and it worked fine. …",40 out of 48 users found this review helpful

 Very salty and a little strange,3,"Maybe I had my expectations set too high after reading the other reviewers. This is nothing like homemade beef broth. Yes, it's better than bullion, and it avoids the ""tinny"" taste that canned broths tend to have. However, it still has a hard-to-describe strange flavor, not the rich beefy taste others described. Plus, it's very very salty. It's hard to make a good sauce or soup from it because of the amount of salt. Each pouch, which reconstitutes to one cup, has 770 mg of sodium. That's higher than most canned broths. I assume that high salt content is to make up for the lack of beef. I don't know how much they use, but the USDA requires less than an ounce of beef for every gallon of water - I don't think they're much higher than that. If you try to concentrate it into a sauce or gravy, it becomes as salty as cheap buffet food. It's not terrible, but it's nothing like the quality of a good boxed chicken broth. I'm certainly not going to reorder it once I run out; I'd rather just avoid recipes that require beef broth. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Too Yummy for Their Own Good!,5,"And way too yummy for my waistline! How come I can't award these things fifteen stars, anyway? Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips are without a doubt, the most delicious cinnamon treats I've ever eaten. They remind me of the best bite of an apple pie crust, without the apples and the goopy moistness of eating an apple pie out of a bag. With Stacy's Pita Chips, you open the bag and get this tiny puff of cinnamon aroma and you are compelled to dive in, face first and mouth open. Sharing is not recommended, but the sharing police aren't going to do anything to you if you give a couple to someone you love dearly. However, that night you will lie in bed unable to sleep, obsessing about each chip that you gave away, and your stomach will growl accusingly. Be warned. Happily, now that you have found these chips on Superstore, you will not go broke because of your addiction. They have a superb price, far better than anything I have found in Boston area supermarkets. For example, I save over a buck every time I eat a bag of chips from Superstore. I'm eating several bags a day, and at dollar apiece, I am going to be rich, rich, rich! (sorry, richness not guaranteed in your area) On a less spectacular note: a baked treat is not a fat-free treat, and calories are the punishment for yumminess. The bag claims that a portion is a measly eleven(!) chips! Eleven! I've had more than eleven chips while writing this paragraph. That miniscule amount of flavory goodness is packed not only with wonderfulness, but also with 140 calories! The tiny snack size bag has 1.5 ounces, and is supposed to feed 1.5 people. That also means it has about 17 chips in it, and I'd be licking the inside of the bag, embarrassing myself for all time, and adding 210 calories to my personal fat-retention system. You may wish to purchase and split a case of Stacy's Pita Chips with a friend, so that you can both wear swimwear without embarrassment in the coming season. Make sure that your friend is there when the friendly delivery person arrives with your chips, or your friendship might be endangered. (Or you might have to buy a second case to split with the friend, but that leaves your waistline in worse shape than it was before) Better yet, make friends with the delivery person, and split the case with him. Enjoy your tasty treats, and if you have difficulty making friends, the kind you would want to share your Stacy's Pita Chips with, I am a kind and friendly person, and can be trusted to split a case fairly and evenly. …",37 out of 40 users found this review helpful
 Never again,1,"I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch. I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor. Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion. I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away. …",8 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Transcendental - you gotta try it.,5,"I'm a bit of spice hound and have flirted with other hot sauces before, but nothing has ever seized hold of me like Sriracha. An old Greenwich Village burger joint near where I worked at NYU used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer. The memory haunted me for years before I finally picked up a bottle. I shouldn't have waited. This stuff is amazingly addictive with a garlicky sweet hot yumminess that's hard to describe. It sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and I've drained a bottle in a 3 month period. Incredible on eggs, superb on burritos, utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegitable dishes from the Chinese restaurant. I put a squirt in the health low-sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up. Utterly highest recommendation. I, personally, do not buy the 28oz size - even though it's almost the same price as the 17oz size. (it's not a total freebie - Shipping is a bit higher on the 28oz). While Sriracha has preservatives and doesn't need refrigeration it does oxidize a bit and at the pace I use it the bottom third of the 28oz gets a bit stale for me, while I suck the 17oz down while it's still fresh. If I lived in a house with more spice hounds (I'm the only one around here) or if I were cooking with it more often in larger recipies the 28oz would be a big bargain. …",55 out of 56 users found this review helpful

 The 28th Five Star Review,5,"Rarely have I encountered a product that doesn't have at least ONE person who either thinks it's junk, or gives a (bogus) low review because the delivery guy accidentally dropped the package before leaving the item at the door. As of this moment, 100% of the people reviewing the Greenies PILL POCKETS have given them a five-star rating, and I'm enthusiastically joining the crowd! If you're a dog owner, you've almost certainly had to, at some point, give your dog a pill that he or she was reluctant to take. The usual remedy until now, (as suggested by our vet) was to simply shove the thing down the poor dog's throat, and then rub their neck to help the pill go down. Recently, one of our dogs --a large yellow lab named Chip-- was suffering from untreatable throat cancer, but he still needed to take a number of pills to make his final days a little more comfortable. The vet specifically mentioned AVOIDING the ""shove and rub"" technique as it would be very painful for the dog --who at that point was even reluctant to eat his regular food. Someone mentioned PILL POCKETS. We picked up a bag and lo and behold, they worked like a champ. Though Chip was still not really interested in eating a meal, the *very* meaty smell of the PILL POCKETS was irresistible to him, and he happily gobbled up his meds. Sadly, we lost Chip about a week later, but then our other dog developed a minor skin rash that required he take some antibiotics. Eubie is a Border Collie, and they tend to figure things out before you do --and we were astounded when he wolfed down his medicine and then looked at us as if to ask ""is that all --when do I get another?!"" My technique for using the PILL POCKETS is to stuff the pill(s) inside, pinch off the open end --and then, using my palms, ""roll"" the pocket into a smooth, round ball. With Eubie at least, he loves the smell so much, that he simply swallows it whole. In fact, I discovered another great use for the PILL POCKETS and that is to take a rawhide bone and smear the nooks and crannies with a single pill pocket. Since they're kind of ""doughy"" in texture, they're perfect in this regard --and for a dog that will happily walk around the house with the rawhide bone for days without ever chewing on it, we've found that the ""pill pocket infused"" rawhide is something that he HAS to chew on. (In fact, he was SO focused on this task, that for the first time ever, he actually ignored the fireworks on July 4th.... it was truly amazing!) - Jonathan Sabin …",26 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee,5,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday. I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now). However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee. I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"". Enter Donut Blend. I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family. When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it. Here is my take on it: It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity. Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii. It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee. If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup. Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one. Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.

 wish they were in glass bottles,4,"I wish these were in glass bottles, but sometimes UPS beats boxes up pretty good, so I see why they're not. The water sitting around in #1 plastic for who knows how long means the plastic could leach into the water. Free delivery of bottled water from Superstore is really fast. I wish I could find cases of this stuff locally, ideally in glass bottles. I don't know why that's so difficult. I realize that coming all the way from Italy this water has a huge carbon footprint.

Yes, the Torani has sugar, but it's pure cane sugar, not high fructose corn syrup. We also use Pellegrino to cut and fizz up lemonade and juices. In the glass bottle, on ice, Pellegrino is a great alternative (or supplement) to wine at dinner.

 Worth the Price,5,"This European licorice product is excellent especially as it is ""sugar free.""

But, in any event I am thankful that I can purchase this product in quantity without having to travel a distance to a specialty food store for it and at competitive pricing. Gustaf's makes other licorice products, e.g. ""Double Salted"" which is also an acquired taste as the ammoniate in it is more discernible both taste and in odor for some.

 raisins are HARD AS ROCKS...................,3,and they aren't softening in the milk. you will need strong healthy teeth to chomp on them. the cereal itself sops up a lot of milk & it expands quite a bit (so don't pour too big a bowl like i did. now i'm trying to stuff it all down). There is the occasional really hard nugget of grain mixed in. when i come across one it tends to jam into my cavity & is a little uncomfortable. but for the most part the cereal is soft & easily chewed just like mashed up wheaties. Honestly this tasted strange to me on the first couple bites but as i sit here enjoying my first bowl i'm getting used to it. before i bit in i thought i detected a weird smell. i think it's just the way one or more of the grains smells & i wasn't familiar with the scent of that particular grain. or maybe cause they are sprouted they smell different. OR perhaps the addition of cinnamon did it. if so it's the only time i smelled something w/cinnamon that didn't smell better w/the cinnamon added. in summary i think this is a pretty good cereal for those into super healthy foods. The average person looking to add some whole grains could do a lot better in the taste & texture departments. If you are interested in sprouted grains specifically then i can't say for sure as this is the only sprouted grain cereal i've ever had. I think i may try another box but next time i'll get the one with almond slivers. perhaps those flavors will be more complementary. and i'll bet the almonds are softer than the raisins.......i'll be sure to review it once i try it! …,3 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Something's Changed with Canidae food,1,"I fed and recommended this food for several years as one of the best dry foods available. However, over the last few months (late 2007) something has changed. My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it. Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped. I tried another bag last week-- same results. Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months. No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners. Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address. I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems.

" Lots of Nut, Little Chocolate; Mixed Results",3,"I was particularly excited to try Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds when they arrived in the mail today as I love chocolate and I love nuts. Five individuals ranging in age from 2 to 50 tried these together and shared feedback. A few common threads emerged. 1. Chocolate doesn't come off on your hands: Very convenient as there is almost no residue left on hands even after holding a handful of nuts for a minute. 2. Very subtle chocolate flavor: For some this is a plus and for some this is a negative. You know the chocolate is there, but in my opinion it just leave you wanting more chocolate. I couldn't eat more than 10 or so for that reason. They were just plain frustrating. This was the consensus of 4 out of the 5 taste testers. The fifth loved them and plans on finishing off my canister and probably ordering more. They are definitely not milk chocolately, but have barely discernible, subtle dark chocolate undertones. 3. Dry: We all needed to drink water immediately after tasting the nuts as they dried our mouths out, much more than normal salted or roasted almost or any other nut for that matter. Three of us described them as tasting ""burnt"" or ""too roasted"". 4. We keep eating them: Even though I'm not crazy about these nuts - in fact only one of us was - we keep coming back for more about every hour or so. I get frustrated every time I do, either wanting a chocolate bar or just some plain old chocolate. Perhaps this is a good trait in a snack, that you can't keep eating them ad nauseum. Other observations The 11 oz ergonomically comfortable container is about 8 inches tall and fits perfectly in your hand or in the cup holder of the car. The lid is screw-on rather than flip-top. The package contains 11 servings of 150 calories apiece (120 calories from fat), 13 grams of fat, six grams of carbs, and 6 grams of protein. Very much the same as other nut products. The conclusion? If you aren't sure already that you love these nuts, buying a four-pack might be too much for you. But if you love them, you love them, as evidenced by our one taste tester and many of the other reviews. I'd recommend trying a smaller volume before ordering in bulk here. …",38 out of 44 users found this review helpful

 great brand of stevia in convenient tablets,5,":: SteviaTabs Stevia Extract Tablets, Pack of Four 100-Count Packages :: I am hooked on always taking my coffee with stevia. The form I most often use is the shaker jar, the blend with FOS, from this same reliable company (Wisdom Naturals). But I also buy their product in tablets for the convenience. I take a packet with me for when I am away from home (travel, motels, etc). Another good reason for choosing tablets that I learned from experience: I was trying to get a friend to switch to stevia for his coffee instead of the chemical whatever-it-was sweetener tabs that were his habit. He reported that the stevia was far too intenseley sweet. I was suprised, but then after further dialogue, learned that it was because when he used the shaker jar, he poured in too much. Since then I found that setting a stevia-newbie up with tablets, and the simple instructions of 1-2 tabs per cup, it's what makes for the best approach. Note! Amzn's current price on these, less than $4 per pack, it is VERY good. I spent a lot of time last winter researching lowest possible price on this product. I really believe AMZN's price here cannot be beat -- particularly if you're calculating in the current promo of 20% off and free shipping. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" Refreshing, and very similar to Jose Cuervo Margarita mix!",5,"Margarita mix is expensive and usually laden with calories (well, alcohol is too!). I don't drink a lot of alcohol, but when I do, I almost always order Mojitos, Margaritas, or Sour Apple martinis. I love the taste of them and thus the alcohol taste isn't overpowering for me. Therefore I was delighted to discover these new Crystal Light mocktails in my local grocery store (about three bucks a canister). The Crystal Light Margarita mix tastes just like Jose Cuervo Margarita mix to me, even the slight salty tang. This one and the Mojito are so good all on their own and I love them. The Appletini is a bit too much like drinking Jolly Rancher green apple candy, so I only like that one in small doses. They are obviously not as syrupy-thick as real Margarita mix, but that's a plus to me. It's very refreshing on a hot summer day. Each canister has 5 packets, and each packet makes 2 quarts. An 8 oz glass of this is a no-guilt 5 calories. It's great both as an option for non-drinkers and to add alcohol too if you wish. I've been back to the store several times now and they don't have these any more - when I bought them they were marked ""temporary"". So now this is the only place I know to get them. …",28 out of 30 users found this review helpful
 Teff is great stuff,5,"Teff replaces oatmeal as a hot breakfast cereal. Teff's pretty unique, its a tiny seed. It doesn't get mushy when cooked, but does stick together. To cook it boil it in water- use about 1/2C Teff to 2 1/2 C water- to serve two or one large guy. Add some salt too, say 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon and just boil until thick. Stir so it doesn't stick to the pan. Flavor is kind of nutty but mild and its really good. Its much higher in protein and complex carbs so you can feel the difference around noon- still with you. Its a definite must have for athletes and if you can afford it everyone else. You may also like grated orange peel, nutmeg, cinnamon or for us we add toasted anise seed as well for peak flavor. We serve it with milk and a pinch of sugar. Its excellent, if you prepare any dish like this you will probably find Teff is better than all of them. Take advantage of the shipping deal when you buy two boxes. …",27 out of 28 users found this review helpful

" My 2nd fave coconut water, better flavor than ONE, VitaCoco, Zico--BUT Amy&Brian's is best tasting of flash pasteurized",5,"I used to get several cases of ZICO on subscription here on Superstore. But Zico changed their packaging AND processing (instead of fresh, it's now from concentrate). If it had still tasted the same, I prolly wouldn't care it was from concentrate, really. But when does a ""from concentrate"" drink EVER taste as good as natural. Have natural tangerine juice, then drink one from concentrate? Yeah, not the same. So, I've tried O.N.E. and VitaCoco and assorted brands found in supermarkets and Latino stores over the years. But I always went back to Zico. Now that Zico is horrible (tastes and smells funny), I needed a new coconut water for my daily fix. I decided to try this since Superstore offered it to me in a Gold Box Deal. Well, it arrived today and I LOVE IT. It has a nice sweetness and a clean taste and it's got that refreshing quality that chilled coconut water gives. Heck, I even like it at room temperature. It's not the stinky-sour horror Zico now is. I also like that it's organic. That's a bonus! I agree with the other reviewer that the can is great for chilling it up real cold. UPDATE: Apparently, this brand pasteurizes at quite high temps, so there is a legitimate concern that it loses nutrient content. I therefore recommend that, for those who want more than just a great taste, you either email the company and confirm if they have switched to flash pasteurization, or switch to Amy and Brian's (which flash pateurizes and has a BPA free container). I disagree with the reviewer that says those other brands are tastier. I grew up drinking coconut water (my dad would split them open with a machete for us to sip straight out of the coconut), and this one tops O.N.E., which has been my Zico substitute until now, and VitaCoco (which I do agree is sourish and way down the choice list). But what ""tastes good"" is subjective and we won't agree on best taste. But I can tell you this tastes really close to real coconut water fresh from a tree in your backyard (though nothing beats the real, fresh thing). I'm assuming changes in flavor are to be expected since coconut water will vary from nut to nut. Even Zico was not consistent formerly, sometimes sweeter, sometimes more water, depending, I assume, on the batch of coconuts. Any drink that's from actual fresh juice will have variations (and I guess Zico went to concentrate in part to standardize the flavor). So, I may just have a crazy good batch here in my hands. :) I've just signed on for a subscription and three cases are on their way to me, yay! Thanks, Superstore, for this alternative now that I'm exiled from Zico. Heh. Update: I tried Amy and Brian's CW after this one, and I actually prefer the A&B due to the sweetness. It has that lovely light, clean, fresh taste that Nature Factor has, just sweeter. That may not be the best for everyone (some folks will want it less sweet, not more, due to the difference in carbs). But for me, I love sweetness, so I'm hooked. But you can't go wrong with either NF or A&B. Enjoy either or both--as I will. So great to discover fabulous new beverages that are healthful. Addendum re Potassium: This possible potassium-compromising may end up being great for those who want, not just organic, but to minimize potassium intake but enjoy coconut water (ie, those on Ace Inhibitors or potassium sparing drugs, those with kidney function issues). I'd check with the company first--definitely-- to make sure of actual postassium content before considering it safe for the K-avoiding crowd. Something to consider, though, what with so many Americans on high blood pressure meds. But until the company confirms or denies or makes clear what it's ACTUAL end-product electrolytes/Potassium content is, K-avoiders should avoid all coconut water unless your docs okay it. …",33 out of 34 users found this review helpful

Although I think they smell repulsive my labs cannot get enough of them. They will harden over time, they are super-moist to begin with. But I have found that they stay fresh much longer if you keep them in the refrigerator I also recommend the american chicken jerky that comes with the skin and coat optimizer, Showstopper (Unflavored) 4 Lbs. + Free American Chicken Jerky - 3 Oz. . Another favorite in this household, they go crazy when they see the bag. The jerky does come in much bigger pieces but they are easy to break into two, which I usually do and share half with each dog. Now if I only watched my own diet as much as I did my dogs, I may actually get somewhere, lol. One thing is for sure, Superstore definitely has the best prices for pet treats and supplies.

 Product not as described,3,"Package arrived in time. I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery. The salt was more like rock salt - the crystals being slightly larger than what you find in kosher salt. I have to dilute it with water before I can consume it. If you sprinkle it on a salad or similar semi dry food, you will feel the crystals, which is an unpleasant experience because it feels like you have sand in your food. This salt is not like regular salt that dissolves easily with little moisture/liquid. The package it is in is also labeled ""finely ground"". I use it for cooking - where I have no problems with it.

" A perfect ""Anytime"" coffee that is sure to please.",5,"I have tried many, many brands and blends in my Keurig coffee maker and this is definetely one of my favorites. The type of coffe I drink depends on my mood. Sometimes I want a strong, bold cup like, Newman's Own Extra-bold Special Blend K-cups, 80 Pk for Keurig Brewers and sometimes I want something more mild like, Mountain K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108-ct.- Nantucket Blend But ever since I have had my Keurig I have been looking for one of my favorite coffees. The Dunkin Donut brand. This coffee is superb and very much like the Dunkin Donut brand. Not bold or bitter. Not weak or under flavored. It is smooth and very flavorful. It is the perfect crowd pleasing blend for any time of day or night. I have shopped all over and you can't beat the variety or the price here on Superstore when you join their club. A great value. I do wish that Superstore would change the name by removing ""Extra Bold"". It is not. It is, at most, a medium roast.

 First Rate Blend.,5,"I really enjoy coffee, and I have ever since my teenage years. My tastes have gradually evolved and escalated. The first to go was any kind of instant coffee. How anyone could drink that swill is beyond me. Next to go was any kind of additive, such as cream or sugar. The next to go was any kind of ground coffee in a can. Some is marginally OK, but compared to whole-bean coffee, it just doesn't cut it. No, whole-bean coffee without any additives and ground on the spot is the only coffee I'll drink, short of some kind of emergency. When It comes to whole-bean coffees, there's quite an amazing variety. I found Trader Joe's to have an excellent selection from all over the world, and the cost (on a per pound basis) was typically about 50% that of what you might expect to pay in the local super market. I particularly liked their Columbian Supremo. The problem is, the local Trader Joe""s is a long way off and I sometimes run out between visits. Well, I've then picked up some large bags of beans, one of which was Starbucks French Roast, at my local Costco store and it was quite excellent. Starbucks is first rate, but tends to be somewhat pricey, even when purchased at Costco. Well, one day I discovered the Kirkland Signature House Blend bags of whole-bean coffee at Costco. In my opinion, Kirkland Signature products have always been of the highest quality but at a substantially reduced price. For example, this Kirkland coffee is almost half the cost (on a per pound basis) of Starbucks French Roast. But, right on the front of the Kirkland package it says ""Roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co."" Hmmmm. I just had to try this one. Well, it's excellent. It's a little less robust than my Starbucks French Roast, but I prefer it that way. I'd say it's first rate coffee at a bargain basement price. Buying whole-bean coffee at the local supermarket is now out of the question. Gary Peterson …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 Unique sweetness makes Nectresse a winner,4,"""Hello, my name is David, and I'm a sugar addict."" ""Hello, David."" True, I love my sweets, but my sweets do not love me. Hence, I tend to rely on sugar substitues (perhaps a little too much) to stave off those sugar cravings. My go-to has always been stevia, in one form or another, whether liquid extract, powder, crystalized (Truvia), or organic ground, as I think stevia is an excellent sweetener. But, always willing to try something new, I was happy to indulge in Nectresse, a new natural sweetner from the makers of Splenda. The primary source of sweetener in Nectresse is monk fruit (aka luo han guo), which I have eaten as an additive in other foods, and have always found to be tasty. This was my first opportunity trying it as an actual sugar substitute, so I tried to utilize it in several different applications. First, on its own, Nectresse is great. I initially thought there was a slightly off aftertaste, but I realized it was hints of the monk fruit itself, and the flavor everntually grew on me. I then sprinkled Nectresse on various kinds of fruits, from watermelon and peaches to strawberries and cantaloupe, and it fared well on all of them, adding just the right touch of sweetness without overpowering the natural flavors of the fruits. I also added Nectresse to cold almond milk, as well as hot tea, and was very pleasantly surprised to see how well the granuals disolved in liquid, which tends to be problematic with stevia (mostly so with Truvia). And not a lot of Nectresse was necessary to sweeten the drinks (maybe half a packet), so a little goes a long way. I did not have the opportunity to bake with Nectresse, so I cannot comment on how well it does in baked goods, but based on my initial observations, I think it's likely to perform well. Now, I would exercise some caution here, as there is sugar in Nectresse -- though, less than 1g (which, in a 2.4g serving, could still be significant). The other ingredients are Erythritol and Molasses. So, if you are on a complete no sugar diet, you'd likely have to skip this sweetener. Still, there are 0 calories overall, with the Erythritol providing 2g of carbohydrates. Overall, I think Nectresse is a far better option than Splenda and Aspartame (especially considering their sketchy health and safety issues), but in my opinion, not quite as good as stevia. But, taste is highly subjective, so I think opinions are likely to be quite divided here. I will definitely continue to use Nectresse, as it's a great form of monk fruit extract, but it won't be the first product I reach for when attempting to quell my sweet tooth. …",19 out of 22 users found this review helpful

In regards to the criticism by other reviewers for it containing propylene glycol - don't be in a panic like them. propylene glycol is harmless unless ingest massive quantities of it. Using a canard like ""it's considered harmful to pets so humans shouldn't ingest it!"" is just alarmist behavior. Chocolate is harmful to dogs. Better not eat that then!

 Great Product In Wrong Container,5,"Undoubtedly, the purchase and use of stool softeners would plummet if everyone, including physicians, considered magnesium. Fact: An insufficient amount of magnesium in the body is a primary cause of constipation and hemorrhoids, yet most physicians unwittingly recommend stool softeners. Fact: By taking your measure of Natural CALM daily your constipation will quickly subside. Friends, before you devour any more medications why not try a natural remedy? Natural CALM is an easy-to-assimilate powder that when mixed with water becomes effervescent. More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM. Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars. Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage. Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: ""Place powder in a glass or mug,"" it says. ""Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water."" Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide. Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy. Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch. Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors?

 Real Quality Nutrition,5,"I got this for my long hair male cat who has been prescribed wet food by the vet after having urinary tract problems. I read about Weruva and that the Paw Lickin' Chicken would be good for him and keep his urine pH at levels to prevent struvite crystals, just like the vet prescribed food. The Paw Lickin' Chicken has a lot of water and low magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium. But unlike the veterinarian recommended food, it has no byproducts or fillers or grains. Weruva actually looks like food, not gruel, and it doesn't have an unpleasant smell like a lot of cat foods. Weruva costs almost as much as the vet prescribed brand, but Weruva is clearly made with superior ingredients. I will still be monitoring my cat for any problems, but so far this food is working fine for him and I feel better knowing he is on a better quality food. At first my cat was hesitant to eat the Weruva food, but I believe that was simply because he wasn't used to the texture. The Weruva chicken is shredded into fine strips, rather than minced. My cat would drink the juices, as he had no problem with the flavor, but was reluctant to actually eat the chicken. So I had to mix it with the prescription food he had been eating before he would eat the Weruva food by itself. It is a good idea to mix the food with what your cat has been eating, anyway, so they can gradually get used to it. Now my cat doesn't hesitate and will eagerly eat the Weruva food. …",47 out of 50 users found this review helpful
 Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!,5,"I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy. The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes. My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical. Obviously, my experience made me a believer! I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands. And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Two Paws Up!,5,"My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them. But I needn't have worried, they loved it! The Tuna Too Cool is a rich-looking, reddish pate with lots of jelly on top and my twosome were wolfing their portions down and got into a bit of a scuffle over the last couple of mouthfuls. They have no higher praise. …",24 out of 25 users found this review helpful
" holistic health approach-- high in fat and protein-- ask your vet first if your dog is old, a pup, or overweight",4,"My dogs liked the taste of this food just fine, although they didn't go crazy for it. (I purchased it for a dog who was very thin and needed to gain weight.) The ingredient list of this food sounds great-- no corn or other indigestible grains, and lots of great healthy vegetables, fruits, and carbs in addition to high quality meats and probiotics. There are NO yucky ""meat by-products""-- just meats and meat meals you can feel good about. Unfortunately this food has a higher than normal fat and protein content. Very high protein (minimum 32% in this food) may not be a good choice for every dog (this is especially a concern for older dogs). The fat percentage (minimum 18%) may great for working dogs and active dogs, but the average American couch potato dog could pack on pounds with that much fat unless you increase exercise and/or reduce your portion size (and that may lead to a dog who doesn't feel full/stays hungry). If your dog is already overweight you would probably want a food with one-third the fat of this product. If you decide to use this food I think it would be a good idea to monitor your dog's weight carefully to avoid having weight gain sneak up on you and your best pal. I am skeptical of dog foods which claim to be perfect for all life stages, too-- puppies and 15 year old dogs can survive on the same foods, but that doesn't mean the same foods are ideal for each dog. You might want to compare this with similar high-quality holistic foods such as Blue Buffalo Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs. or Wellness Super5Mix Chicken Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag) (there are several great Wellness varieties) or Nutro Natural Choice Ultra Adult Dog Food- net wt. 35 lbs. (there are several varieties of Nutro Ultra, too). These foods have the same high quality human grade ingredients, but appear to have a little bit lower protein and fat profiles. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Here's a list of the major ingredients/nutritional profile-- check it out, talk it over with your vet, and make up your own mind about whether or not this is a good choice for your best pal. Bison, venison, lamb meal, chicken meal, egg product, sweat potatoes, peas, potatoes, canola oil, roasted bison, roasted venison, natural flavor, tomato pomace, ocean fish meal, choline chloride, dried chicory root, tomatoes, blueberries, raspberries, yucca schidigera extract, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces cerevesiae fermentation solubles, dried Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, and the expected added vitamins. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Wondering if your dog is overweight? An easy way to tell is to look down at your dog while it is standing. Viewed from overhead, you should see a definite ""waist"" narrowing in front of the back legs. Another easy test is to feel the dog's ribs. You should be able to easily feel slight dips between the ribs-- if you can't they are covered with a layer of fat (of course, prominent ribs mean your dog is too thin). …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 The best coconut package out there,5,"I have tried just about every coconut water company out there (Zico, Harvest Bay, Vita Coco, etc.) and this by far is the best and the closest to the coconut water out of fresh young coconut. Nothing will be beat drinking it right out of fresh coconut but O.N.E comes the closes. The coconut water is supposed to taste like fresh refreshing, slight sweet water with just a hint of coconut flavor. If you taste strong flavor of coconut, it is probably over ripe or aged. This container also doesn't have any package smell as some of the other coconut water packages have. Just remember to buy them fresh and chill them before you drink. The flavor is much better when chilled. Highly recommend buying this over the other brands. …",69 out of 75 users found this review helpful
 Warning: Make sure you're buying the right flavor.,1,"I bought some of this chocolate for my mother who can't have much caffeine. She used to drink Nestle hot cocolate, fat free-caffeine free, but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches. Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephen's on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Superstore are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Superstore would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its ""food"". and the company who makes it basically said ""Sorry, but it sucks to be you"". So here I sit, 110 dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use. …",1 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Poor customer service,1,"I ordered some xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very, very strange, foul smell. Kinda like mothballs. They get some of their products made in China (the erythritol, apparently), so I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination. I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund just for the strange smelling items (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable). She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again. Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one of the same thing since I'd never ordered from them before. (Note: I only wanted a refund for the unopened bags of the item in question. I did not ask to return anything else in the order.) I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same. Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site. While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me. I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc. Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried. I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective. I have learned that some products are made in the US, but when I called I only inquired about the erythritol, which they themselves confirmed was made in China. NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar. They are also available here on Superstore . Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on. --------------------------------- -I ordered a wide variety of things, including this item: erythritol, xylitol, gum, candy, etc. It included this item and a lot of other things. -I asked only for money back on items I tried that were suspect as being defective, and then only for the items I had not opened. -I asked the manufacturer if the items were safe to consume, given the very odd odor some of them emitted. This was as a result of a legitimate concern. -I did not know at the time that only some products came from China -- the customer service rep did not make that distinction when I asked. I was therefore worried about all of them. -My review concerns primarily the customer service problems I had, as well as the concern with the origin of their products I had ordered in general. Personally I think it is odd that when I called to return a small part of a rather large order that the customer service rep did not want to honor the guaranteed refund posted on the web site. She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing. How was I to know the substance would smell so badly? She said I should have just ordered one. What difference does it make since I had only opened one? The others were perfectly sealed. She said she would take them back after much ado, and then said they would never accept another order from me. (Like I would anyway after that). This company should not post a guaranteed refund when they don't mean it. …",16 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 It only took me 40 years to discover this fantastic oil!,5,No kidding. My wife has been asking me for 40 years why french fried potatoes and other vegetables never turned out right. This Tophe Rice Bran Oil is the answer! French fries that are brown and crispy on the outside and soft and perfect on the inside. And no greasy mess. No sagging. And the paper towel you use to absorb excess ends up perfectly clean and dry. This oil is a chef's dream. I only wish I had discovered it 40 years ago! If you appreciate vegetables and meats that are perfectly fried - look no further. Don't take my word for it. You have to try it just once - and you will never settle for anything less. Outstanding oil in every respect and super healthy to boot! …,15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

" RESPONSE TO ""B. DAVIS"" ON METAL FACTOR",3,"Well, now I'm totally confused. Thought these totally eliminated the metal factor in cans [aside from the waste factor as well after opening]. I naturally assumed that the tubes were all plastic as many tubes are for other things, and that's why it survives in the fridge. Where do you store the rest of the tubes before using, before opening. Is it safe to be even IN the metal before open as CANS are not after an expiration date? This is a lot of money to spend all at once on tomato paste not knowing if even ""IT"" will go bad. Rachael Ray's and other cooks buy their supplies almost daily, not in `bulk' so that's fine for them but not for me, I always buy in bulk, not shopping often. Another suggestion is to flatten out the paste in a zip lock bag, freeze, then break off portions as used, being thin enough it's easy, OR freeze portions in ice cube tray then put into zip locks when totally frozen, or on any surface temporarily also putting into zips when frozen. But that also can be a pain, having to do that all the time. Seriously considering whether to get these, especially knowing they're metal tubes or even lined with metal. Can't find in any stores in NYC and getting very frustrated for a long time since I don't travel around to markets. I have many little cans of Paste always but think, ""ahhh, why open one just for this"" or for that and getting fed up not using them. Just threw out another remainder of 8 oz. can which I thought I'd use soon, but didn't and forgot about, in fridge otherwise I would have put the whole thing [in an empty marjorine cup] into the freezer for when I `felt' like making portions but forgot, therefore another almost full can into the trash. Enough already with the cans. It's 2010 and they should be more readily available, but guess the manufacturers love this 'can' game to induce more waste, therefore more sales. Thought the tubes were the answer, but now this makes me wonder about the metal in the tubes as well. I don't use things up that quickly for even the tubes to go fast, but thought they were at least safe. …",2 out of 21 users found this review helpful
