 Great value!,4,"I have purchased more expensive truffle oils before and they have all been wonderful, so naturally I was skeptical when it came to a ""cheaper"" price. This has a nice taste and with any truffle product-- a little goes a long way! The oil they have used to infuse with the truffle is grape-seed and it is really nice to cook with. Weather on a budget or not, I give this product a thumbs up! Hope this helps! …",22 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 One of the great cheeses of the world,5,"The only real Parmigiano (Reggiano) is one of the great cheeses of the world. The best Reggiano (there are different grades of Reggiano, too) is much more than a grating cheese--it is a cheese that can be eaten by itself, before a meal or after. The best grades of Reggiano are best shaven paper-thin (use a good cheese plane) and will have a slight pineapple taste when savored slowly.

 Menopause Relief,5,I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep. I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately. I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes. I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink. I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much. …,16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Dark Magic is my kind of Magic,5,"Green Mountain's Dark Magic Extra Bold is my go-to coffee for use with my Keurig coffee machine. I go through more of this particular flavor then any other type of coffee. In fact I don't think a day goes by that I don't have at least 1 cup of this flavor, if not more. Don't let the words dark and extra bold scare you off - this coffee is rich, smooth and in many ways mellow. Its not overly acidic, it does't taste burnt, its just a good cup of ""coffee flavored coffee"". It works well with most flavored creamers, sweeteners, but is a pleasant cup in its pure and unadorned form as well. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 My Wife Loooooooves it.,5,I took a chance; it was the first time I tried a kit wine ( I make mine from fuit etc.).

This is great fruity tasting and refreshing wine. If you don't want your kit I'll buy it from you. Our stock is running low. …,11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Fantastic Blend for Fast Growth....,5,"REVISION: Below I said to stop using Nitrogen later in the season, but I have had to adapt that recommendation. Over the last two years, early blight has stricken tomatoes nation wide, including places where it was relatively rare like New England. Entire farms have been wiped out, especially organic farms. Early blight can be treated with a fungicide, but you need new stem and leaf growth to compensate for the leaves and stems lost to blight. You will have a smaller crop at the end, but losing the plant will result in many fewer tomatoes. I found after several of my plants succumed to blight (no tomatoes, a couple of branches of leaves, etc.) that providing the rest a good dose of late season nitrogen helped them enormously. So, I would suggest now, until the early blight has run its course (maybe never) you should use Miracle Grow Tomato Plant Fool all season and don't try to overinduce the flowering and yield of your tomatoe plants. Two live healthy plants with average yield are way better than one dead one killed off by blight. Watch for youtubegarden , for more info. -------------------------------------------------- I always plant with manure (raked into the soil, about one 25 pound bag of dehydrated manure per 10 plants, about 2 feet apart and spaced 3 feet per row) and some fresh garden top soil (just placed in the hole where the plant is, not throughout the garden). If you remember, it is good to mix in lime as well about a month or so before you put the tomatoes in the ground. It helps by providing calcium to the plants and helps prevent blossom end rot. Although, I rarely have had any problem with that here, it can depend on your soil, so better safe than sorry. If you forget, don't worry, things will work fine without it for the most part. I plant the tomatoes deep, relative to the size of the plant. 1/3 down into the soil or more depending on the size. Before I do I place fresh garden top soil in the hole and water it. Then I place the plant firmly in the muddy mixture and surround it with more fresh garden top soil. I have not found that different brands of gardening soil are better, so any cheap bag at your local gardening shop will do. I have never lost a plant doing this. People talk about other ideas like using 80 degree water to water the plants or using special techniques to keep from hurting the plants. But I have never used any technique like this. Hose water is fine as is rain water. I do not fertilize my tomatoes until a couple of weeks have passed and they have rooted and grown a bit. I let the manure, new garden soil and lime do the job. After that, every two weeks, I apply Miracle Gro, and when I do, the plants are more vigorous, grow faster and I have fewer problems with the plants such as discolorations of the leaves or bug infestations. I have heard numerous folks say to use less or more than the directions, but you know, the 1 Table Spoon per Gallon of water always has worked for me. About a gallon for every three plants when they are young. A bit more when they get to be 2 feet or more. The box does twenty plants for the period of the season I use it. I use a bucket or watering can for mixing. I have not had good luck with the automatic dispensers attach to the end of the hose and it seems to waste fertilizer. But your mileage may vary. When the plants first start to show fruit and have reached about 3 feet, I stop using Miracle Gro and switch to a no-nitrogen fertilizer. I find that by the time the plants are 3 feet tall, their root growth is fantastic and their leaf production is strong, so I want to focus on flowering and fruit production. Something that reads 0-10-10 or even higher is fine. Just absolutely no nitrogen. I have tried other fertilizers for my plants. Nothing has worked better than Miracle Gro and some brands seemed to not work at all. I have always been satisfied with Miracle Gro and stick to it for great tomatoes and strong plants. …",34 out of 35 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Saturated Fat Nightmare,1,"With all the reviews of this popcorn, I'm surprised not to find any mention of the horrible saturated fat content of this. Anyone with any concern about their cholesterol or saturated fat content really needs to look closely at the nutritional guide. I couldn't find it listed on their website so I asked them to email me a copy. Wow, 40g of saturated fats in one of these packets and they call it 5 servings. Daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie/day person is 16. You would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. The biggest concern I have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. The problem is entirely with the oil they are using. Coconut oil. They list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. Most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. I asked Great Northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. They refused. It tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. In some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. I love popcorn. But health is a concern to me. If you are concerned about saturated fats, look at the nutritional guide for these packets. …",4 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" Awww, Nuts!",4,"Supposedly, Crunchy Nut has been available in England for quite some time and Kellogg's finally decided to bring it over to US shores. Kellogg's used to make ""Nut & Honey Crunch"", though it was discontinued a while ago. Like Crunchy Nut, they came in both flakes and ""Os"" versions. I have fond memories of eating Nut & Honey Crunch in the 80s, and missed it when it was discontinued. Remember the ""Nothin' Honey"" commercials? ;) Well, if you want to relive those days, give Crunchy Nut a try. To the best of my taste buds' recollection, the crunch and flavor are nearly identical. There is the sweet tang of the honey coating and satisfying texture of the peanut-sprinkled corn flakes. The flavor is comparable to frosted flakes, but with honey and nut flavors. It holds up well in milk, retaining it's crunch down to the last bite. Comparing ingredients and nutritional information from their respective boxes shows that they match up pretty closely there as well, though the serving size for N&H is 2/3 cup and for CN it is 3/4 cup. If anything, ounce for ounce, Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut Flakes looks a little healthier for you than Nut & Honey Crunch. That's not to say it truly healthy though. Sure, it is fortified with the usual assortment of vitamins and when eaten with milk you fill even more of your daily nutritional requirements. However, it is still laden with sugar, honey,molasses and High Fructose Corn Syrup. My taste buds must have changed a bit since the 80s because it is almost too sweet for me. Blame it on a steady diet of low sugar cereals over recent years. I would have a hard time eating this regularly first thing in the morning. Instead, I mimic a habit of my father's and eat a small bowl of it in place of dessert. You could even mix it with other cereals that contain less sugar (as my dad would do). Don't get me wrong, Crunch Nut tastes great on it's own, and if you have a sugar/crunch craving, it hits the spot. It even makes a good breading base for fried chicken. I just no longer have quite the sweet tooth I once did. I give Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut Flakes fives stars for flavor, mouth-feel and craving satisfaction. One star comes off for health impact though. If you decide to give it a try, I would shop around a little. Current 3rd party vendor prices are ludicrous. A much better deal can probably be found at your local grocer. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Terrible product.,1,"I don't like this product at all.I have been growing fava beans for my own home use consumption for more than 20 years.Unfortunately this year's crop was not as good as I had hoped for and I was looking to buy some additional beans. Looking at the offering of Superstore for the Westbrae beans I thought that this was just what I needed but what a disappointment. After opening a can, at 1st glance inside I knew these are very old beans. How could I tell?

 Tropical Treat,5,I love this coconut oil! It has a delicate coconut aroma and flavor. I have only just started using it but have found it to be delicious when making pancakes in lieu of using butter. I have also used it as a substitute for butter when making grilled cheese sandwiches and baked sweet potatoes. It will do wonders for your hair and skin too. I especially like using it as a hot oil treatment for my hair. I mix the coconut oil with a few drops of lemon essential oil and rub it into my hair.

 A little weak but tastes pretty decent,3,"I just received this product today and although I've been disappointed with K-Cups that weren't coffee or tea in the past (like hot cocoa and sweet tea) I figured I'd give these a shot since it was only $9.99 for 24. I drank it hot, although you can also brew it over ice for a cold drink. Immediately after brewing I noticed it looked a little weak in the cup, but it smelled pretty good. My reaction to my first sip was a bit on the ""bleh"" side. The caramel taste was a little odd and a touch sickly sweet. However, as I drank a little more it grew on me. It's certainly not like heating up a nice cup of real cider from a farm, but it's more convenient, it doesn't go bad, and makes a decent little cup of cider on a nice chilly evening. For $9.99 I recommend giving it a shot. Don't go all out and buy the 3-pack of 18 cups right off the bat though. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 So Good why isn't it Bad???,5,"After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked **** hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend! The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else. First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right. Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches. It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the ""bowl"" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked. I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too. All in all, I highly recommend them! Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway. Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this! PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Superstore I've found a site called ""netrition "" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Superstore is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food. I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Superstore charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Superstore, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them. So like I said, Superstore is great for most things, but when it comes to food, Netrition is a whole lot better! …",26 out of 27 users found this review helpful

 Super noodles,5,"I love these noodles and ordered by bulk directly from Konjac. This will be an ongoing order for me. They come packed in a water tight bag. You just rinse, add your other ingredients and heat up. There is a strong fish smell upon opening. However, once they are rinsed and mixed with other foods, they automatically take on the taste of the food. Just as good as spaghetti. The bags are 9 oz. each and it feeds two people, even though it does not look that big. Excellent for low carb diets. I'll never use regular pasta again. …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",38 out of 40 users found this review helpful

 Warning: Contains Menadione,1,"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex. Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance. Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption. A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997. Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells. Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats. …",20 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Best Tasting and Healthiest Ready to Drink Meal Replacement Shake,5,"I've been searching since the days that Kashi stopped producing their meal replacement shake mix for something that tastes just as good and is just as good for you. I've tried both available flavors of Orgain and I find the chocolate to have no remnant of soy protein in its taste. The shake tastes great at room temp and amazing chilled. I appreciate that there's some remnants of veggies and fruit in the shake too. Potential downsides: It's not all oil, sugar, and protein....although its mostly that... So it's not exactly as good as sitting down and eating a sandwich. The shake is only made in pre-measured little boxes so there's no opportunity to save some money with a tub of a dry mix. The shakes are expensive too. The trade off is better ingredients, instead of unpronounceable and artificial junk found in say, Slimfast (although that too is mostly oil, sugar, and protein...just from worse ingredient sources). The shake is also not vegan if that's something you're looking for. There's currently only 2 flavors of the shake too, so if variety's your thing, this isn't a good shake to try out long term. I still rate this 5 stars for the ingredients, the taste, and the fairly extensive nutrition content. I wish this had more veggies and fruit in it though...vs. 50 mg each of a fruit and veggie blend. …",40 out of 43 users found this review helpful

 Great hard-to-find product!,4,"Red lentils (Masoor Dal in an Indian grocery) can be hard to find outside of specialty stores, and Bob's are fresh, clean, and tasty. They make delicious soups with an earthy flavor and great texture. My favorite recipe is made in the slow cooker with onion, celery, tumeric, coriander, and cumin. It is so simple and easy but I can't stop eating it! They are also good cooked with rice as is common in the Middle East and India. Some people seem confused about the desired consistency of red lentils. Unlike the brown or green lentils that most of us are used to, red lentils have had their husks removed. This is why they cook so quickly. This also means that THEY WILL NATURALLY DISINTIGRATE INTO A PUREE. If you don't like this ""mushy"" texture, then you should probably stick to lentils that still have their seed coats. All lentils are a great health food with lots of vitamins and fiber and huge amounts of iron and protein, making them especially important for vegetarians. I would give Bob's 5 stars if they were organic. I'm also a little puzzled about 27 oz being chosen as a unit size.

 Milk-Bone Dog Treats - Digest of Poultry By Products?,1,"WHAT!! When you understand what the buzz words mean, you become an educated and informed consumer capable of making a good choice for your pet and your money pouch. So many of my friends' dogs are sick with cancer and other diseases. Whay are they eatting...? I made the choice will you; or do you like to have your ears tickled? The Painful Truth: You really do get what you pay for when it comes to pet food, as illustrated in Ann N. Martin's book, Food Pets Die For. First published in 1997 and updated in 2003, Martin's book was the first to expose the ingredients legally used by pet food companies, including euthanized cats and dogs, zoo animals, roadkill, and diseased and rotted meat unfit for human consumption. Lest you think that what Martin documented isn't widespread, she writes: ""In later investigations in both the US and Canada, I was to learn that the collars, tags, flea collars, and even plastic bags in which (euthanized) pets are wrapped, are not removed before they are shoved in the rendering pit. Deceased pets are being 'recycled' into pet food, and pet owners have no knowledge of what is happening."" * Poultry by-product meal. By-products can include: intestines, chicken heads, duck bills, chicken and turkey feet, feathers and bone, soy, cottonseed hulls, corn cobs, peanut hulls, citrus pulp, screenings, weeds, straw, and cereal by-products. Ingredients listed as beef, chicken and poultry by-products are not required to include actual meat. Rendered meat can be ANY rendered mammal meat, including cats and dogs. If the ingredient contained enough meat that it could be measured, it would be labeled as MEAT. * Digest of chicken by-products. Animal digest is a cooked-down broth made from unspecified parts of unspecified animals. Any kind of animal can be included, and the animals can be obtained from any source, so there is no control over quality or contamination. * Corn gluten meal. Corn gluten is a cheap by-product of human food processing. It offers little nutritional value and serves mainly to bind food together. * Soybean meal. Soybean meal is a poor quality protein filler. The Crude Protein analysis on pet food labels is only a measurement of the amount of nitrogen in a food -- not the quality of the protein. Because of this, pet food companies can use the cheaper by-products of human food production, such as soybean meal, to boost protein numbers. …",5 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 400+ is overkill and way more expensive,4,"I bought this for a skinned knee that wouldn't heal. I read a little about this honey before I ordered it and thought more powerful is better. I did more research and clinical studies from New Zealand have proven that MGO 250 (old 16+) is just as effective at less than half the price. The reason that Manuka honey works is probably due to its methylglyoxal content (which is a common element in many foods). Unfortunatley, methylglyoxal is considered to be a genotoxin. I use it externally but I'm a little reluctant to consume it regularly. It does help wounds heal without infection. I put a little on the wound and cover it with a adhesive bandage or gauze. The bandage needs to be changed regularly. It does work as an antacid. It takes about a teaspoon -- preferably on a small pice of bread. …",32 out of 35 users found this review helpful

The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less ""filler"", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a ""super-premium"" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan.

" Cheap, nasty garbage parading as healthy.",1,"There are dozens of organic and/or so-called ""natural"" salad dressings on the market, but I've never seen and tasted such garbage in my entire life pretending it's healthy. Annie's lines are comprised of the cheapest and smallest amounts of ""organic"" indredients possible.

Once upon a time, actually it was a Wednesday; anyway, I decided to go on my lunch hour from work to the nearest Chinese buffet restaurant. I usually do not frequent the buffet lifestyle because I am afraid of what goes on behind closed doors, and the sneeze guard is just gross. I was happy to see that they had healthier fare to choose from, and sushi, so I filled my plate with steamed veggies, sushi and a dumpling or two. I sat down alone at my table, facing away from everyone because I just have this thing about people watching me eat, and something really brightly red caught my eye. It was in a Giant squeezy bottle, with a rooster on the front; I picked it up and read the label ""Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce"". Hmmm, a condiment that I haven't heard of, ME the so called Condiment Queen of Gainesville Florida. I squirted a bit on my plate, dipped my chopsticks in it and tasted it, GOOD LORD UP ABOVE, it was Huy Fong good, spicy garlicky vinegary so tasty, I then doused my entire meal with the HazMat red concoction and reveled in its goodness. I rushed out after work to the nearest Asian market, of which I frequent a lot, and there it was so many squeezy bottles how did I ever miss them before? I grabbed three, plus two of my regular Hoi sin bottles, a jar of pickled ginger and proceeded to grin like a Cheshire cat to the register. On the bottle it also says its good on pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs, pasta and I have to admit the stuff is good on almost everything.

" Holy SALT, Batman!",2,"We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a ""healthier"" alternative to regular chips. I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip. The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor. The big issue with these is the sodium level. After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt. A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.

 Patio Dining,5,"I received one of these Bavaria Hams as a gift from a well-meaning, Glazed Ham loving, though non-cooking friend. So, being the nice person that I am, I invited he and some friends over for some Ham, Asparagus and a big pile of Yukon Gold Potato salad. And since it was hotter than blazes inside, I decided to heat the Ham and roast the asparagus and potatoes on the BBQ. I slathered the Ham with my secret BBQ sauce, placed it on the cooler side of the Grill and about 2 hours later we were all sitting down on the patio with a big, hot, delicious, BBQ'd Ham staring us in the face. The French Rose' was poured, the Meal was consumed and a good time was had by all. …",2 out of 21 users found this review helpful

" Cytomax, a runners best friend.",5,"I have been using Cytomax regularly for about six years now. I cannot preach the benefits of this product enough. It really does beat the burn. The percieved exertion levels, the lowering of lactic acid levels in muscle and the subsequent enhanced recovery are all truly part of the package. I frequently use it before bed when I know I will only have a limited time to sleep (i.e. 3-5 hrs) and have found that I will have deep restful sleep and awake feeling invigorated. It is also a handy hangover drink according to some of my past roomates.

 Avoid Online Orders,1,"Be careful what supplier you select because returns aren't allowed. I had ordered this chocolate several times via Superstore. From Superstore directly, the G&B bars (made in Canada) arrived promptly. Then in late 2009 my first (and last) order, fulfilled Nutricity, arrived a month after the order had been placed, and then only after an inquiry to the seller. The bars were dry, stale and hard, the color of cocoa powder rather than chocolate bars. Although the bars still had 10 months to go before expiration of the sell-by date on the wrappers, they were a disgrace to the good name of G&B. It may be that they had been stored improperly, or that the single paper wrapper used in the Italian plant (the Canadian maker uses an inner foil wrap) allowed too much air to get to the bars. I ground them for hot chocolate, but they were unsuitable for eating directly and very similar in quality to the bars one sometimes finds at mass-market outlets that resell overstock from other retailers. Two years later I tried again, but had the same experience. The order was fulfilled by a different Superstore supplier, not Superstore itself. Again, the bars were stale and appeared to have been improperly stored (although they did arrive promptly.) In the future I will use a supplier with which Kraft (owner of Cadbury, owner of G&B) seems to have better quality control --- my local grocer. …",19 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 It got my milk flowing.,5,"I wanted to switch my baby to formula, but it gave her gastrointestinal problems. I then decided to switch back to breastfeeding. I had only stopped for about a week, but my milk supply had significantly decreased. I was producing about 2 oz every 3 hours. (My baby has a cleft palate so I exclusively pump. Because of this I am aware of exactly how much milk I am producing.) I ordered the Fenugreek (which arrived surprisingly fast)and started taking it immediately. The bottle suggests taking 1-2 pills 3x a day with food. I started off with that dosage while increasing my pumping sessions. I did not notice a huge difference at first. I read on other message boards that most women take 3 pills 3x a day. I increased my dosage. After about a week of Fenugreek at the higher dosage plus an increase in pumpings, I noticed a huge difference. I would get approx 6oz every 3 hours. My first pump in the morning around 5am I normally get about 10oz! My freezer is now full of milk and my supply has stayed consistent. I now pump for 20 min every 4-5 hours, with an 8 hour break at night. My milk supply has not diminished and I am confident it is the Fenugreek. I have not had any negative reactions or experienced any maple smell that some women have mentioned. I have not experienced any side of that can be attributed to Fenugreek. The only downside is that since I take 9 pills a day the bottle doesn't seem to last very long. However, Fenugreek is super cheap so buying more isn't really an issue for me. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

I tried some from the health food store, and fell in love with the taste, but it was very expensive for a tiny bottle. I started looking for a bulk source online. Tophe pure rice bran oil 1/2 gallon, here on Superstore, was the best value I found. It tastes delicious on salads and in cooked foods. I think it is the most tasty cooking oil I've ever used.

 Not at all reliable,1,"Overall, I cannot recommend this machine. The machine made excellent espresso for the first few weeks we had it. Once it was broken in, the espresso was average, and the crema was more of a large-bubbled foam. The grinder is able to create a fine grind, but unfortunately the machine can't pass any water through it, so you have to use a mid-level fine grind. The machine is able to adjust the amount of water used per shot, but anything more than the smallest available setting creates, well, coffee. Not even an Americano, just coffee. After three months the grinder broke. When I opened up the machine's door a broken part flew out. Superstore sent me a new one. One month in on the new one, the brewgroup jammed. I thought it was broken, but after four days, the machine was able to pry itself loose. Ground coffee was all over the brewgroup, as if it had exploded. We'll see how it works out. A bright spot--Superstore was astoundingly helpful and gracious. They replaced the first one, postage payed, express delivery, with no questions at all. They offered to refund the original purchase price on the second one, until it broke loose and started working again. I cannot complement them highly enough! …",44 out of 50 users found this review helpful
 Titan Loves his ZiwiPeak Venison!,5,"This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain. More on that later.... Some background: My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier. He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband). He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food. Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison. Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Superstore. I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...). So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats. Titan went mad for them. It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares. You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky. But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw. Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door. He barely lifted his head from the bowl. For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France. When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure. Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine. Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept. When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet. I added a little canned venison to entice him. No go. Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating. Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there. Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag. Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag. I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time. The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO! But back to my point: I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!). So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain. And, it is high quality. Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam? Titan's never had that with this stuff. I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up. So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line. I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!). I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well. …",18 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 Customer Service?,1,"I was a Blue Buffalo advocate from day one when I purchased it for my dog. The ingredients were fantastic for a pet-parent who's dog is allergic to anything with corn or chicken (which is hard to find). I'm a trainer at Petsmart and told all of my clients about this product. This was before I had to deal with their customer service department. On my way home from work one night I realized I needed to stop and get a bag so I swung by a Complete Petmart and picked up a bag. I got home and realized it had been expired for almost a year. On the bag it said they guarantee their product 100% and this guarantee means they will tell you to take it back to the store and exchange it and that it was your fault that you didn't look at the expiration date. Why did I have to do the leg work for someone who is paid to check the dates? In my Petsmart, Blue Buffalo has a store rep who is supposed to be rotating product and she visits every week. How is this my responsibility? They kept sending harassing e-mails and would never really answer my question as to why the store representative let a bag of what is supposed to be a high-quality brand sit there expired for almost a year. I have since switched my dog to Evo and happy to report his stools are much more solid and he absolutely loves it. I'm sad the customer service for this company doesn't exist because I truly believed in their product. The only reason it got 1 star is because the first ingredient is actual meat and not a meal. …",4 out of 93 users found this review helpful

 My personal fave,5,"My husband gave me a Keurig coffee maker, so we've been trying different flavors of coffee. To me, I don't care about brand necessarily, I just like flavored coffee. On the top of my list are Gloria Jean's assorted flavors (Hazelnut, French Vanilla, White Chocolate -- I think). That one also includes a Mudslide flavor, but we thought it had a slight coconut taste we didn't care for. I like the Kahlua brand Kahlua coffee, but the flavor portion is a little strong. But my VERY, VERY, VERY favorite flavor is this Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle flavor. It's just the right balance of ""coffee"" to ""flavor"" ratio. You can taste it, but still taste the coffee. And my kitchen smells heavenly! But a lot of it boils down to personal taste and preferences. If you typically like this type of flavored coffee, you will love this flavor. And I definitely recommend Subscribe and Save for K-cups if you have a Keurig. It's the most economical way to get them. You get a discount and free shipping. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 FAST PRIME HEAT SINGLE SERVE BUT...,3,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:37 Mins </span>From a cold start, 90 sec to heat, 30 sec to brew. While already on, reheat and brew, 45 sec!!! But not compatable with reusable K-CUP??? Whats up with that??? I am considering returning this item. According to other reviews the OfficePro line may have a better pump compared to the Home line. Although louder and more vibration, equilavant to a loud aquarium air pump. I considered the compact B130 DeskPro, or even the other Mini editions can take up to 2-3 minutes to brew. Other considerations, this has a water resevior where the B130 did not, I quickly came to apreciate the benefit to having the resevior. Was disapointed unable to hook up a water line, that would have been great. The metal drip plate rattles during the pump priming setup, it is very annoying but just removing the plate and just using the bottom plastic catch below to hold the cup for brewing works well. Note another reviewer suggested using a mouse pad underneath to help with the vibration noise. Unable to reproduce rattle for the video, appears to have gotten better aftere a few days. Be sure your countertop is level. As earlier mentioned perhaps the biggest negative is the OfficePro line is not compatable with the reusable K-cup filters, as I prefer larger, stronger coffee and would like to use more/my own coffee grounds. Note one could run a double 6oz size to get 12oz. Another reviewer noted that the EKOBREW is compatable. So I will give that a go. Note it is highly recommended to use DISTILLED water to prevent scalling. It will be interesting how this unit stands up over time, currently just using filtered water.

 The flavours are not lies!,5,"These beans are a wonderful thing. The good flavors, you can eat, and they are totally fantastic. The terrible flavors, you can belittle the manhood of your friends with. The in-between flavors? Like grass? They're largely there to confuse you, and do so wonderfully. To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote: Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. ""Okay,"" I begin ""but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth."" My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt! Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. ""Alright,"" they said ""This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow."" Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth. It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg! Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful. The rotten egg, dirt, soap, and vomit beans all taste exactly what they are supposed to. And that is what makes them a fantastic product. …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 Only Two Tastes - Salt and Red Pepper - yet I like it. Add an egg and it really improves. Unfortunately it is far from healthy,3,"Don't under estimate the appeal of salt and cayenne (red) pepper for many ""soup lovers"" and reviewers. That includes me. I certainly like this soup - but I'm under no illusions - it is far from healthy and it only has two flavors. Candidly, this is nothing more than a watery Noodle Soup with lots of Red Pepper and a tremendous amount of salt. If you add an egg --- it can taste even better. Chop up some scallion and it further improves. There is nothing terribly impressive about this soup YET, as I said, I like It. This dry soup mix consists of a large packet of noodles (essentially tasteless yet ladened with 500 calories of saturated fats) and two much smaller packets. One of these small packets contains less than a tablespoon of chopped dried vegetables and the other is a ""spice"" packet consisting largely of salt, msg and red (cayenne) pepper. Add some water and you have 2 1/2 cups of soup. Impressions: Beyond the watery base (there are no thickeners), my first impression was that of salt followed ---- after a few more spoonfuls -- of the emerging heat of cayenne pepper. As is typical with cayenne pepper, the heat builds up on the palate over time. Some might call this soup ""medium hot"" but for many I'd imagine they would call it ""very hot"". However, it easy to adjust the heat level - just add less of the salt/spice packet. But the only real tastes here are those of salt and cayenne pepper. The noodles are essentially tasteless and the vegetable packet is so small that it can add nothing more than visual appeal. However, I'll say it again, don't under estimate the appeal of salt and cayenne pepper! This soup can be greatly improved by cracking an egg into the mix and stirring it in during the last minute of boiling. The egg not only adds a much needed third taste but also thickens the soup considerably. I was quite surprised how much an egg improved this soup. Make no mistake - adding an egg really changes the character of the soup. At the [...] I paid - with shipping - for a case of 20 -- this soup was a good value. I'd give this soup 3 or 4 stars with an egg but I'm a bit biased toward anything ""hot"". Maybe 3 stars with an egg is most appropriate and 1 or 2 stars is more accurate for this soup without an egg? HEALTH WATCH: One packet of this soup provides almost 90% of an individual's daily allowance of salt!!!!! That is a stunning amount of SALT. Plus this soup has 40% of the daily allowance of SATURATED fats (thanks to the palm oil used to fry the noodles). With almost 500 calories, you'll be adding a few inches to your waist line if you eat it regularly. It is shame the company choose palm oil to fry its noodles in (presumably to save a few cents) and added so much salt. It makes this soup needlessly unhealthy. It is, in fact, a poster child for all that is wrong with processed foods. I have to add the ingredient list is truly frightening with a long list of chemicals - far more than is typical - even in processed foods. This is probably not a soup anyone should serve more than once a month. View this soup as equivalent to a bag of potato chips, no more or less healthy. Of course, adding an egg to the mix, just makes this soup less healthy. Another HEADS UP - some of the reviews on Superstore strike me as a bit suspect: There are a number of 5 star reviews generated by One Time ONLY Superstore reviewers. Once these ""reviewers"" have promoted this company's product - they never publish another review. I've seen this same pattern, time after time, for all the other soups made by this particular company. Finally, everyone should keep in mind how hard it is to believe that any dried soup with a tiny ""flavor packet"" could ever rate 4 or 5 stars among people that have a serious love of soup. Consider too, the simple fact that very few of the soup's ingredients are even readily identifiable as a ""food"". My thanks to the previous reviewers who suggested adding an egg. It made a world of difference THIS SAME SOUP IS SOLD in CASE LOTS OF: 20 PACKAGES, 30 PACKAGES or 40 PACKAGES. ALL OF WHICH ARE LISTED SEPARATELY ON Superstore. The prices differ on a package by package basis too. Generally the 30 pack, which ships for free, is the better value. …",19 out of 25 users found this review helpful

" Agave ""nectar"" is a scam",1,"from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.: Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food. Sorry. Don't kill the messenger. It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word ""Agave"" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup. Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as ""diabetic friendly"". What's not to like? As it turns out, quite a lot. Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener. All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS. Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price. Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) . And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat. In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent. ""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"". Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you. …",19 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 Amaizing Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds,5,"These are one of the best snacks on the planet. The only thing that even comes close is Slim Jims. I used to get two small foil packs of these out of a vending machine, and a can of Pepsi for lunch every day when I was going through post grad school, and they never got old. The smoke flavor isn't too strong nor so subtle that you can't detect it. They have a perfect amount of crunch, and just the right amount of salt as well. Wash them down with a Pepsi, (or Coke if you prefer) and it doesn't get any better. Why someone gave these a one star review due to the price is beyond me. You rate the product here, not the price. But people also sue McDonald's for their coffee being hot, so what do you expect? If you've never had these give them a shot. You won't regret it. …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Awesome!  Better than Pop Tarts!,5,"I stopped eating pop-tarts because of all the junk that was in them (hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, etc). I tried these and - wow! They are actually better tasting than pop-tarts. They still have the rich buttery crust, but their filling is actual fruit, and tastes incredible. These look exactly the same as pop-tarts, right down to the foil wrapper and little grooves on the back of the pastry. They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors. This doesn't make them completely ""healthy"" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Please take the corn syrup out of the recipe!,2,"I just bought 2 bags of the product. Tried and it was all PRO's until I noticed the big CON: one of the ingredients is corn syrup! I usually eat all organic food and love healthy stuff - I'm sooooo against corn syrup. I could've avoided the surprise, though, by reading the ingredient list that was disclosed in the product's page at Superstore . Well, as I said before, there are good things about the product, too. The chocolate bit is really creamy as they say, and deliciously bittersweet. It tastes so fresh and helped boosting my energy. Oh, and the delivery was really fast - I had it in two days! Please, please, make them without corn syrup so that I can give it 5 stars :) !! …",12 out of 28 users found this review helpful
 Contains artificial dyes; Ingredient description inaccurate,1,"I searched high and low looking for gluten free, casein free, and dye-free sprinkles. I thought I had finally hit the jackpot when I fell upon India Tree products and read the ingredient description here as of this review's writing. Many India Tree products are indeed dye-free and good for those of us on the GFCF diet. I thought that these non-pareils would be the same high quality and natural ingredients as the rest of India Tree's decorating sugars. I was wrong. Got the HUGE jar of sprinkles today (dented; thanks Superstore shipping) and the ingredients are as follows: Sugar Corn Starch Confectioner's Glaze FDC Yellow 5 Red 5 Blue 1 food grade carnauba wax FDC Red 40 Yellow 6 and Blue 2 I'm willing to pay a premium for good naturally colored sprinkles. But when you're just the same as the sprinkles in the grocer's aisle, I don't know what's the point? Next time, only buy India Tree's ""natural"" product line.

 Menopause Relief,5,I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep. I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately. I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes. I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink. I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much. …,16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Espresso,5,"I bought a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas this year. We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good. …",29 out of 29 users found this review helpful

 Highest-Quality Soba Noodles in the U.S.,5,"OK guys, what we have here is a basic misunderstanding about how Japanese buckwheat noodles differ from semolina pasta. This was my favorite food when I lived in Japan, so let me tell you how it's done. The cloudy boiling water means it's high quality soba. Eden is right about adding cold water, but only keep cooking it until it's al dente--sometimes three repetitions is too long. When the soba is done, SAVE a cup or two of the cloudy boiling water for a special treat later. Drain the soba noodles and rinse them. Then, and this is critical, soak them in a bowl of ice water for 3 minutes until they're nicely chilled. Japanese people do not stir-fry their soba noodles, as far as I can tell, so if you want to go that route you're on your own. The Japanese tend to eat all their noodles wet. Soba is often in hot soup, but the best way in the summer is to use a dipping sauce. You can buy one from an Asian market (I like Yamaki brand). Sometimes you're meant to dilute the dipping sauce by half or a third with water. Into the dipping sauce grate some radish, slice some scallions, and put a dab of wasabi paste. Mix it up. Then pick up a small clump of soba noodles, put them in your dipping sauce, and then slurp some of those noodles up into your mouth. Make sure that you take in air as you slurp and don't suck too tightly or the noodles will fly up and hit you in the eye! Repeat. When you've finished your noodles, pour some of the left over boiling water into your dipping sauce. Mix and drink! It's healthy and delicious and all the best restaurants do it.

 This is the Best,5,"McCann's (in the tin) is nothing like the tasteless mush that passes for oatmeal in the U.S.. True, it does take 25 minutes and sometimes you need to fool with the water amount and/or the flame until you figure out what to do to get it exactly as you like -- too high a flame, for example, does away with the water before the oatmeal is completely cooked, but remember you don't want it to cook so long that the special consistency is lost. I've cooked it for years but even so when I took a can to our country place where we have a propane gas stove, it was as though I'd never made it before. However, the finished product is well worth the time. Even unadorned or with just a bit of grated nutmeg, it has a satisfying crunch and slightly nutty taste. My husband, based on bad childhood oatmeal memories, initially turned up his nose at the thought of eating oatmeal; he likes it so much he makes it for himself several times a week. Two of our younger grandkids accustomed to starting the day with cold commercial cereal ask for the ""special"" oatmeal when they visit. Additionally, it's substantial; a serving at breakfast easily holds you till lunch time. PLEASE NOTE -- what I've written refers only to McCann's in the tin; I've never tried the flakes. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 Solid Medium Roast Coffee with Just a Hint of Bold. Good Flavor. Not Acidic.,5,"Good choice for your morning coffee if you like a medium, slightly bold flavor. Vienna coffee is not a real bold coffee, so medium roast coffee drinkers should like the flavor.
