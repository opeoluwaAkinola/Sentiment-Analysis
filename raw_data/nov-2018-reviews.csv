 Simply the best coconut water.,5,"This coconut water s by FAR the BEST coconut water there is out there. I was hesitant buying this can over the glass bottle you normally find at health food stores, but I will say it does not disappoint. The taste is just as good and the price is right. I always found myself wanting more with the glass bottles and this satisfies that quite well. Highly recommended! …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 A nice introduction to TVP,5,"This is my first time using tvp. Tvp is really easy to prepare and inexpensive when compared to ground meat. To me, it doesn't taste like meat, but it has the same texture in my mouth, just not that greasy flavor. It works well in recipes too. A much healthier alternative to ground beef. We love this stuff. Each bag has about 2 cups dried tvp, which will make a couple of meals. …",29 out of 31 users found this review helpful
 NOW stevia extract is the best I've tried so far,5,"I give NOW stevia 5 stars as they have the best stevia I've tried so far - but I've only tried their extract packets. This one has no additional ingredients and no aftertaste (if used sparingly as intended). Stevia will not have the exact same type of sweetening taste as granulated sugar or honey or other such sweeteners. It is concentrated and super sweet, and has its own flavor and the more you add the more unpleasant it can get. A smaller amount is best over a larger amount. I eventually got used to using a smaller amount and adjusting my sweet taste - just like adjusting to lower salt. From my previous research, stevia is the safest alternative, calorie-free sweetening product (or should I say ""nutritional supplement"") available. It is a natural product and not a manmade or altered substitute sweetener and appears to have none of their negative side effects. I like the handy packets of the pure extract to carry with me and have used it mostly for adding to things like hot and cold cereal and drinks like tea and coffee. I've not tried it much in baking, but there are stevia cookbooks available on Superstore. There are cheaper products available with a mixture of stevia and other sweeteners, but not everyone reacts positively to some of the other additive sweeteners. If you don't, then try another brand, or stick to the pure extract. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Delicious and filling!,5,"Kashi GoLean Crunch! is really good. Seriously, truly tasty. It's got a real ""crunch!"" to it, as the name makes clear -- but after the initial crunch, it's got this understated sweetness about it, a mixture of cinnamon and maybe a little honey. Mmmm. A bowl is very filling, and here's the amazing part: it actually KEEPS me full. For hours. As for the ""clumps"" that some people are complaining about, those are my favorite part! It's just a characteristic of the cereal -- kind of like how, sometimes, pizza will have a bubble of dough in it. Mmmm. Love the bubble, love the clumps. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Terrible customer service,1,"I purchased this through Superstore and it was shipped from Starbucks . I received the order promptly, however when I opened the shipping box, I found the product box with a round blue sticker over the broken seal that keep the product box sealed. Inside, there was coffee grounds all over the box and stuck to all the packets was this gritty stuff. There were 2 sleeves of VIA that were obviously opened and causing the mess in the box. Each of these packets also had a blue sticker! So it was pretty obvious that I was shipped a known defective product. When I called Starbucks, at first they wouldn't help me and treated me like they didn't ship this item (because I ordered thru Superstore) and would not replace this product. They said I would have to pay to ship it back to them and they would send a refund. I didn't want a refund, I just wanted the product replaced. They said that after I returned it, I would have to completely reorder and pay for the product. I called the customer service again and got the run-around. There customer service is awful. I guess they figure they can afford to lose a customer if they behave this way. That is why I am posting this review.... I would not recommend buying from Starbucks. …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Very Impressed,5,"After a lot of research, i decided to switch my 3-yr old Doberman from Iams to Canidae and have been very impressed with the product. Samson LOVES this stuff too, with the Iams I had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food/tablefood, but with the Canidae, he eagerly wolfs it down by itself. And why not? The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less ""filler"", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a ""super-premium"" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan. When you look at it like that, I believe it's one of the best values in pet nutrition on the market today. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

" Not bad, but decidedly unlike any other K-Cup product",3,"Full disclosure - I worked briefly for the people who make this product back in the late '70s. Since I had a personal connection to the product, I really wanted to like it. And it's not bad - it's OK, but it's just a bit odd. First off, the packaging. These aren't your father's K-Cup, where it's an actual cup. These have a top like the traditional cup (so they'll fit in the brewer) but the bottom is completely different. It's almost more like a filter than a cup, and kinda rounded rather than cup-shaped. They come in sealed plastic bags of twelve, so you need to keep them in a ziplock bag or some kind of airtight container once you open the bag, unless you're planning on using them all right away. Second, the flavor. It's OK, not bad at all, but it just tastes a little off for some reason. A hint of odd flavor. Also, it seems to lack body, for want of a better term. It doesn't have that rich, full, satisfying flavor I expect from a good cup of French Roast. Lastly, it seems to leave more sediment in the bottom of the cup than traditional K-Cups - not sure if that's a by-product of the design or what. Bottom line - it's not like I'm going to throw them away. I'll keep them and drink them, but I probably won't buy them again. I much prefer the flavor of just about any regular K-Cup to these, even non-premium brands like Folger's. UPDATE: After drinking my way through the whole case and comparing them with other K-Cup products, I have a bit more appreciation for these and might consider buying them again, particularly given the excellent price of around 38 cents a cup if you use Subscribe and Save. One other point I neglected to mention in my original review is that these seem to produce more ""crema"" - the brownish foam that appears on top of a good cup of coffee - than most K-Cup products. Keep an eye out for my reviews of the Rainforest Blend (which I found somewhat weak and flavorless) and Fog Chaser (which just arrived and I've yet to sample) varieties coming soon. …",54 out of 63 users found this review helpful
 Best Taste and No Aspartame!,5,"Building muscle while burning fat became paramount to me while on the Body For Life program several years ago. After being on the program for 9 months, I developed muscle for the first time in my life in addition to losing lots of fat. I attribute a great deal of my success to fueling my body with the right foods...including meal replacement drinks twice a day to keep my metabolism revving. Finding the right meal replacement powder (MRP) for those two meals a day became almost an obsession. I had four main criteria: 1. Low sugar content (very important to me as the more sugar I have, the more I crave it) 2. High amounts of vitamins and minerals 3. Good tasting without the Aspartame (I have a sensitivity to it) 4. Easy to mix--especially on the run I did a lot of research and a lot of testing. My quest for the best took me through chalky tasting ones, chemical tasting ones, downright nasty tasting ones, and difficult-to-mix ones. Finally, I got around to Labrada's Lean Body for Her shakes. I originally tried them because of their low sugar content but ended up loving how much energy they gave me and the great taste. I mainly used vanilla because I could mix nut butters and fruit to mix up the flavors. Loved them! Due to health issues, I went off program for the last two years, but I recently recommitted myself. Because of my previous success with Labrada Lean Body for Her, I went back to using it for two of my six meals each day. Right away I noticed there are a few things different with tLabrada's current MRP. I don't know how they did it, but they made the vanilla even better! I got the ""Soft Vanilla"" flavor and it taste just like ice cream! It is also even easier to mix. It seems like the powder itself is ground finer, which is probably why. The nutritional information is: Calories 190 Calories From Fat 30 Total Fat 3.5g Saturated Fat 1g Trans Fat 0g Cholesterol 20mg Sodium 300mg Potassium 360mg Total Carbohydrates 9g Dietary Fiber 3g Sugars 1g Protein 30g Lastly, while this may not be important to others, I truly love the fact that the tear strip on the envelopes actually work and are easy to open. A small detail perhaps but just the right added benefit to top off an already great product. As on most things, the Superstore price is great...and I save even more money by using the Subscribe & Save. I'm not sure who controls shipping speed on the S&S, Superstore or the seller themselves, but they certainly ship fast! …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Apparently the supplier read the reviews about packaging,3,"I received my 70 cup sampler pack, but had low expectations about the packaging and concern about the expiration date on the cups. Looks like whoever makes these packs read up on the reviews. My cups arrived in a beautiful box with a flip top and each cup nestled in its own little 'cell'. Beautifully packaged and absolutely ideal for gifting. The 70 cups were unique, although there was more decaf than I need at least there werent 15 different french roasts and 15 different hazelnuts! I sampled about 10 expiration dates and they were all in the future, from 2-5 months away. I have heard about some problems with many k-cup manufacturers giving incentives to their production folks for how many they turned out, but someone forgot the sales incentive because they made way more than have sold, so many places allegedly have expired or nearly expired cups. Glad to see that wasnt a problem here. I found at least six coffee's I havent tried yet (and I've had a LOT of different k-cups) but wanted to before buying a big box of them. Very pleased with the purchase. Edit: I've pretty much given up on Crazy Cups variety boxes at this point. While I was happy with them at first when I wrote the original review, my last order for a summer variety had christmas cups in it, and the most recent 70 pack was about half decaf and the grove square powdered cups. Guys, most people don't drink any decaf, let alone in these volumes and the powdered stuff not only clogs the nozzles on the brewer, you can get a packaged powdered coffee/hot cocoa/whatever for a lot less money and the quality is better in the packages. Most of the powdered cups have nasty oils in them and fake sweeteners. Ick. So since these guys aren't focused on delivering a quality product, at these prices I can just buy a bunch of regular variety packs without the decaf and powdered cups and get a better price per cup. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 OK but suffers from lack of K-Cup form factor,3,"My wife and I used to live in the San Francisco Bay Area and we loved this coffee, the San Francisco Bay Coffee Decaf French Roast blend. When I spotted this coffee on Superstore for use in the Keurig brewer I immediately ordered it in some quantity based on our past experience. I was surprised to discover that the coffee is not contained within a K-Cup container but rather it is contained in a coffee filter like material with a top which fits into the K-Cup receptacle of the brewer. Our family results are mixed. My wife likes this coffee and drinks it a few times each day. My experience was that the coffee flavor is still good but the hot water passes through the coffee and filter paper too quickly which produces a watered-down coffee flavor. I wish the San Francisco Bay Coffee company would get the necessary licenses to put their coffee into actual K-Cup pods. If the price was competitive, my wife and I would be steady customers. But for my tastes, I'll stick with the Green Mountain dark roast decaf coffees which have a richer coffee flavor. …",53 out of 64 users found this review helpful
" Grain-free, & the protein isn't too much too handle",5,"**Update: March 2012** I still feed this grain free kibble to my shelties, they still love it and I'm still very happy with it. I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids. For some reason, my younger sheltie's tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn't have gas at all. Woohoo! So now I'm able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to. I think I've been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy. By the way, buying directly from Superstore for this item says ""Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks"", but 1-2 days after I order I'll get an update email from Superstore saying something like ""Good news - We're able to ship this sooner than we thought! Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered."" And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering. **Original review** I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Superstore has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety? My younger sheltie has epilepsy. Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet. Canidae is only part of that diet; I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4"" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals. The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies. I know, it's complicated, right? But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this. I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty. I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had **** gland problems where she'd have an **** sac blowout at least once a month. So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed. (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.) Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has **** gland issues. Their teeth are cleaner too. I didn't want this to turn into a ""raw food is the only way to go"" preaching session, I swear! But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her **** glands work like they're supposed to. Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does. However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it. If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food. For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food. The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles. I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid. So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS. I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it. The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right? I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do. As I write this, Superstore's price is the same as my local natural pet store. As much as I'd like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it's a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Superstore. Ingredients: Chicken meal, turkey meal, lamb, potatoes, peas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), lamb meal, ocean fish meal, tomato pomace, natural flavor, choline chloride, suncured alfalfa meal, inulin (from chicory root), lecithin, sage extract, cranberries, beta-carotene, rosemary extract, sunflower oil, yucca schidigera extract, dried enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried lactobacillus casei fermentation product, dried lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid, papaya, pineapple. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" Rich, sweet, full-bodied coffee from a k-cup",5,"Despite giving Emeril's Big Easy Bold five stars, I think it only fair to open with a couple of negative points. First, if you're looking for authentic New Orleans style coffee, you'll likely be disappointed by the lack of chicory root. Frankly, I doubt that most coffee drinkers will mourn the lost chicory. Second, this coffee is a concentrated dark roast; if you're fan of light roasts and mild coffees, this variety will probably taste ashy and too strong. We just started using our Keurig B40 last week, and the first few k-cups I tried were disappointingly watery. The Emeril's Big Easy Bold is one of the few blends I've found that provides a full-bodied cup of coffee without any harsh overtones and without any nasty, bitter after-taste. Made with a single varietal (Colombian-grown arabica), Emeril's Big Easy Bold brews up with a rich cocoa aroma and a thin trace of crema. The flavor includes caramel, chocolate, and fruity notes with a hint of pepperiness, but the chocolate note lingers in the finish. I don't add sugar or cream to my coffee, but I doubt that either addition would detract from the overall experience. Excellent with scones. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Make Your Own !!,2,"I bought two of these directly from AeroGardens. One with the salad greens and one with the tomatoes. I've had them for 32 days now, and the greens are about 2"" tall and the tomatoes show one tomato plant that is no more than 1/4"" high. I called to do an RMA. I have hydronic (infloor) heating, set at 64 degrees, which is very uniform and should not have caused my AeroGrows to fail. I checked the pH and TDS and found that they are way out of whack from what they should be for acceptable levels. I will be building my own hydroponic systems for far less money after this experiment. I am glad I got these on the trial basis which allows you to return them if not satisfied. These may work well in a warmer environment but in the long run, they will not outperform other systems that you can build cheaper and bigger. To the company's credit, they are paying for the return shipping so I am only out the initial shipping (about $30). …",26 out of 31 users found this review helpful

When I contacted the company's cutomer service, I was told that the flowers were delivered, but no one was home, so they were left at the front door of the house (company doesn't have a receipt signature policy). I was also told that I cannot receive a refund or a delivery with signature. As far as I know any reputable company would leave a note to pick up their item from the local USPS if no one is home and would not leave it at the door.

" great for my hair, but causes acne",3,"Hello! am a 17 year old teenage girl and I bought product because I have very damaged hair from straightening. I also have mild acne. I am VERY satisfied with how my hair looks only after one deep conditioning treatment with this. You seriously only need about 1-2 teaspoon and my hair is about 1 and 1/2 feet long. My hair was SO soft! My sister eventually asked why I kept running my hands through my hair all day (I'm still doing it right now :D). And the reason for that is because it was softer and silkier, but MOSTLY it helped keep my hair tangle-free. Before I purchased this, I read some other reviews that claimed it was great for acne. I don't know why but it did not work for me. I only use a teeny bit on my face after a shower and the next day, I had a few whiteheads. At first I thought, ""well maybe its supposed to be like this before it gets any better"".. But it has been 5 days and it keeps getting worse. I am VERY disappointed.

 This Cacao is NOT RAW!!!,1,"Raw Cacao has a high Vitamin C content. This product has O% if you look at the label on the back. Within the last year they covered up where it used to say Vitamin C with Vitality. If you look closely on some of the older packages, you can pull the Vitality sticker off that is covering up the vitamin C label. Which means that it has been cooked/processed in some way that removed that natural occurring Vitamin C. I only use the highest quality cacao, from reputable sources. Less quality, Other ""raw"" cacao beans on the market are not only of cheap forastero cacao varieties, they also are contaminated with several types of dangerous bacteria (remember cacao is a tropical crop where microbe contamination is more difficult to control).

 Pecan Pie Larabar,1,"I have been eating Larabar bars for years and love Pecan Pie bars. A few days ago I received a box from a warehouse in Kentucky. The box had oil spots on it and when I opened a bar, there was a strange odor, almost like fermentation. I ate it because I had no lunch with me at work, but now I have 15 more bars that I will not eat. I think the temperature at the warehouse was too hot. I've never had this problem before. …",2 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 The best spackle I ever received...,5,"Another astute reviewer below referred to the ""chalky"" consistency of this ""homegrown"" brand of mac and cheese. Casting aside the ""growing"" abilities of mac and cheese for a moment, let me say that that reviewer was being extremely gracious and diplomatic. To call this ""chalky"" is call Metamucil, well, ""grainy."" It's the understatement of understatements. Rather than use this for its intended purpose...which I truly fear for those who actually ingest this substance...I noticed how well it clumped and gumped up together. Taking it out to a storage shed with interior yellowish walls, I began hoisting a putty knife to this travesty of a ""pasta"" and...lo and behold...it plugged up holes in the best way possible. Now, slap a touch up of paint over it...voila. Thank's Annie's. So...as a food-substance....Jesus, Joseph and Mary, I would have to pass. But, as an industrial-strength spackle or bonding-agent...go for it. …",2 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Healthy? Don't kid yourself.,1,"Sorry, but this product is NOT HEALTHY. The word ""organic"" only means that the ingredients were grown with out certain chemicals, such as pesticides and hormones. So if you must eat Kraft mac-n-cheese, this is a better choice than regular. But, the word ""organic"" does not mean nutritious! Boxed mac-n-cheese isn't a nutritious choice for growing kids and, organic or not, it's a highly processed food (hint: it still has powered cheese). This food is very high in saturated fat and sodium. Plus, it doesn't contain any whole grains. Kids would be much better off getting their protein and calcium, which this product does contain, from foods not so high in saturated fats! Almost all kids really will eat, and even enjoy, whole-grain pasta, lower fat milk, 2% cheese and many other truly nutritious foods when parents make (or buy) easy, yummy and kid-friendly healthy choices!

 King Crab Legs,5,"First thing is I did not purchase crab legs from Omaha as the price is 10 steps beyond gouging. Here in the NY area they can be purchased for $7.99 a pound, no S&H. There are 2 sizes of legs, larger and smaller [usually referred to as A's & B's] with the larger being approximately $2.00 a pound more. Considering that there's more shell weight than meat weight, $25 a pound is completely outrageous. Look elsewhere for your crab legs.

" The Perfect K-cup, 40 Years in the Making",5,"First of all, yes, it is expensive. Though currently at $59.99 for a 54 ct, the price is not part of my review. I'm sure it'll come down eventually. I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now. As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend. Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill. I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1. The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor. 2. I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place. There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago. It is THE perfect medium blend. There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers. It's bright, but not too bright. Does the K-cup version do it justice? Yes. Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup. I just got home with these an hour ago, and 3 cups later, I can honestly say my prayers have been answered. You know what? Even at $59.99, this review would be 5 stars. It's that good. …",12 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Not my cup of joe...,2,"I purchased this based on the very good reviews and while it was on a sale. I am so happy that I didn't pay full price. I do not like this coffee at all. When I opened the first tin I was concerned because it was such a light roast. This is not at all what I would call a robust coffee. This is more in line with Dunkin' Donuts or a Deli cup of coffee. If you are a fan of Starbuck's or Seattle's Best roasts this will be a let down. I wound up mixing the coffee with a darker roast in an attempt to make it more palitable. Now I have two cans left that I don't want. I'm not saying that this is awful coffee, but it's not for me and may not be for you if you're used to darker roasts and stronger coffee. I was really disappointed because people generally seem to really like this brand, and I liked the idea that it was sustainably grown. …",16 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Better than expected!,5,"The 4-pack of dried milk is a great way for a very small family to use powdered milk without worrying about it losing quality before it is all used up (once packets are opened, they begin to ""age""). And this is organic! I add several tablespoons to the milk in yogurt making, to thicken the yogurt, use it as creamer in my coffee while traveling, and enjoy drinking the rehydrated milk if I run out of milk before my next trip to the grocery store. It doesn't all dissolve instantly, and that is normal and healthy (if it did, it would not be the real thing). But it dissolves quickly enough when I use a spoon to stir it and press any lumps against the side of the container. A blender might work, but I don't use one. Ordering was easy, the shipment arrived in good condition before I expected it. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",18 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Weak at High Setting,3,"This product is an interesting cross between a Keurig cup and a pod. They work in my old B-70, but just from looking at it you can see that it contains less coffee than a typical k-cup. As a result, it brews a decent cup of coffee on the lower setting, but it's weak as a grande. That may work for you - at the current subscribe-n-save price it's cheap for a k-cup. The flavor is perfectly ok - I'm not a coffee purist, but I'd call it a dark blend more akin to Sumatran than Colombian, i.e. not so smooth. There is one thing I guess I should add - these things have a pod-type body, i.e. a filter-packet holding the coffee, instead of the k-cup's all-plastic body. Typical pods come in individual sealed packets to preserve freshness, but all 12 k-pods in each SFBay box are in a single, non-resealable plastic envelope. This means that once you've opened the envelope, you're losing freshness faster than usual. Again I'm no purist, but this would lead to staler coffee if you're not brewing these in a hurry - or resealing them somehow? The box offers no advice or directions. …",16 out of 20 users found this review helpful

" These are good.  Very, very good.",5,"I don't mean ""good for a gluten free cookie"", or ""almost like a normal cookie"". No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good. No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells. No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture. They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free. No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also. According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well. That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff. You're probably wondering what the catch is, right? It definitely isn't the taste. As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good. I only see two drawbacks. 1) Cost. Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected. 2) Quantity. The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies. 16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them. However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us. I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag. Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating. Even so, I still wish there were more in a package. One last note, just because I found it to be unusual. Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight. These aren't. Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others. There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space. It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",38 out of 40 users found this review helpful

 At last we find a food fit for human consumption,5,"And we find her here upon this grand Superstore! Each day Morinu feeds me like my own nourishing mother, cherishes and consents my whims with this wonderful food. Eschew all animal byproducts and cadavers. This tofu is a strengthening food, fit for human consumption. And so convenient from our mighty Superstore, sent right to your front porch or, in my case, post office box with free shipping rather than driving thirty to seventy five miles for the same product at three times the price, plus gas. This is fit food for humans, food for which our bodies are created, food which feeds us rather than kills both the source and the consumer. You may read here written by the self-deceived that this tofu is too mushy for firmness and that it must be pressed between towels before cooking. To them so confused I ask Cooking? Each day at least once a day, I draw forth my serrated knife, and one sacrificial box of this excellent tofu, and I without remorse slice a hole in its top, with great tenderness and care and gratitude, releasing only the slightest and most apologetic gentle spurt of clearest liquid. And this with a certain yearning. I do not observe the indications written sternly upon the short edge of the box, but lie this box gently down upon a smooth flat slab of wood, with the face up, and take the knife very gently sliding upon on edge of the top, the very belly of the box, and then upon the other edge of this top, and then most gently along the bottom edge of this top, each time releasing apologetically the slightest hint of a clear liquid, revealing thusly by means of these three slits the gentle hidden secrets of the box, the soft white substance lying shyly within, awaiting with embarrassment our further processing. I feel the need to explain this procedure with greater care and attention. The very tip, the point of the knife, uncovers tenderly a certain point a certain distance from the corner of the broad top of the box, the side with the picture and product label, as pictured here, the side which reads Morinu, the broad flat side laid flat. The very tip of the knife, I say, discovers probingly a certain point near one corner which offers the proper resistance without too great a resistance, without too little a resistance, to penetrate this membrane. Too close to the corner is found to be too hard, too resistant, too unwilling, although most convenient for the later proceedings. Too distant from the corner implies simply random slashings without specific purpose, and our purpose in this procedure is most serious, most purposeful, intent. In a word therefore the point of the knife penetrates the membrane slowly yet purposefully as close to the corner as possible, penetrating as deeply as possible without piercing the wooden slab beneath. A certain spurt of clear liquid may emerge, but let this prove no inhibition, as the knife reaches the depth of the box. Slowly withdraw the knife, slowly, at a diagonal, allowing the serration softly with friction to continue to separate a slight slit along the ege of the box, slowly, resolutely but patiently, with purpose, as the serration creates an ever longer slit along that edge, as closely as possible. Continue from this first slit along the the contiguous edge of the top of this box, and then the third edge, inserting carefully your knife, and slowly withdrawing with a friction sufficient to separate the membrane without shredding, without eliciting over muchly the clear liquid which may spurt forth. Let us call the top right corner of the box Point A, the bottom right corner Point B, the left bottom corner Point C and the upper left corner Point D. Begin to pierce at Point A, proceed in turn to B, to C, ending at D, forming this a slit along the three edges. Arriving at Point D, withdraw the knife completely, wipe the blade with a soft, dry cloth and set it aside for cleansing. We now may lift the flap thus created, exposing the delicate white contents within. I feel remiss if I do not address a probable misconception here writtenonly for the rhetorical convenience, and I feel compelled by the necesity of correcting this counter-indication, no matter how unclear this may be, due only to my severely limiting literary incapacities. Employing the same alphabetical coordinates as described above, the consumer may discover this procedure far more efficacious: to begin at Point A and proceed gently yet firmly to point B as described. Divergently, however, please proceed to point D (!) and then directly by knife edge to point C, parallel to the Line AB already created, yet along the opposing edge. Having thusly formed two parallel slits, find the midpoint between Point B and Point C as close to the edge as possible, probing and then plunging the tip of the knife through the cardboard membrane, through to the bottom of the box, but now with an orientation perpendicular to that previously used in the formation of lines AB and DC. Withdraw slowly, delicately, yet with sufficient friction at an angle to proceed effectively to the corner at Point B. Withdraw completely and reverse the knife blade, returning it deeply at the midpoint previously entered. Withdraw once more with similar care, and opposite diagonal, completing the slit thus formed entirely to Point C. I am confident the consumer may discover this procedure far more delightful and effective than any here previously described. Firmly we roll back the top flap created by the three slits. Proceed mercilessly, proceed, not frenetically, but ardently nevertheless, to dice within the selfsame box her contents, slowly, gently, but decisively. The fresh tip of my serrated knife, which in recent memory has touched no animal part, but vegetable alone, and never shall become so adulterate with the blood of the animal, with the dairy of the animal, this sanctified and reserved and faithful tip, having never known in any sense animal but only vegetable, purified thus, unadulterate, this sacred knife dares therefore pierce this gentle pure white tofu into a ruthless grid of slits, fully through to the bottom box, plunging first vertically in rhythmically repeated rows spaced gently a few centimeters apart, and then, relentlessly, horizontally, pushing ever so softly through the yielding, unresisting white tofu laid back upon the flat slab, awaiting without a word this process, with utter patience, yielding. Completed this repeated slicing, back and forth, up and down, across, and through, and through, I lift in one hand upwards the entire box gently, yet unrelentingly, over the recipient reserved for this purpose alone. Most often it is the daily lunch container, reusable, with soft top, to receive the more securely and gently this daily offering, removed demurely from its box, as cautiously as a hermit crab from its borrowed shell, vulnerable by exposure. With one finger one may remove whatever residue remains relunctly within the package, passing it reassuringly into the ultimate recipient. Lime juice freshly squeezed upon the tofu deposited there, as ablution, meets fragrant sprigs of fresh green cilantro mated with whole Seeds 7oz , and a generous ladling of the Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12) also available upon this generously nutrient Superstore. This is a meal in itself, and comes most welcome at noon. At night rather than such a cold lunch, in this cold winter a warmer meal is wanted, and so this gentle and yielding box of nutritious tofu might discover herself pushed gently into a saucepan of simmering miso soup, such as, perhaps, Miso Paste NON GMO No MSG Added . This miso soup would take far greater space to describe here in the making. From this container of miso paste draw forth a goodly spoonful to introduce slowly, most politely, into a gently heating small saucepan of water. Later, in place of seaweed and to deceive my own palate, I place those small flat spinach leaves available in the organic department of your local market, perhaps with the results of a small onion diced very carefully in the manner approved as described above, or green onion. When quite ready for dinner, I add last of all to this essence this gentle box of tofu, sliced as described above, with great and tender care, leaving it bathing one might dare say, only long enough to warm through and through, before eating. A veritable meal in itself. There are so many other manners in which to use, and to abuse, this pure, white and utterly nutritious gentle product, and I can only with my utmost recommendation say, and this with my greatest gratitude, that here at long last we may know a food most willingly fit for our human consumption, and one most readily available upon this wonderful Superstore. …",7 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 The Rundown,5,"The Seller: All Star Health is great to deal with. My Brother-in-law and I have used them many times. They ship relatively quick (3-5 days). They always have competitive prices. Until they recently bumped their price on the 10lb container it was the cheapest buy on the net. Now 2 5lb containers are the cheapest way to go. The Product: I have tried Vanilla and Cocoa. Per serving Vanilla has 18 grams to Cocoa's 16 grams of protein. Both Mix INCREDIBLY well. I have a shaker cup and do not use it with this stuff. I use a spoon. Thats it. Vanilla tastes really good. Compared to other brands this is the best vanilla I have had that is not loaded with fat and other junk. The Cocoa is my favorite. It was not at first, It is not Chocolate. It is Cocoa. There is a distinct difference. It came to be my favorite, however, when I warmed up the water in the microwave for about a minute and a half and then added the protein. It tastes just like hot chocolate and mixes even better in the hot water. So now every protein shake is like a large glass of hot cocoa, and when you live in Minnesota, thats a really great thing :). There are a bunch of good amino acids in all of these flavors. I really honestly have nothing bad to say about this product. The only annoyance is that it appears like everyone is steadily raising the price on this stuff. I purchased 10 lbs from one place online for $47 within the last year. The next time I went to the website it was $67. I went to all star with my last purchase and the 10lb tub was $51. Now it is in the 60's.

However, this time I heard him poking around back there, which was strange, but he's a strange cat, so I didn't really think much about it. Then at some point, I opened that drawer for something totally different (I had forgotten about the catnip) and found that somehow he had gotten his paw over the back edge of the drawer and OPENED THE BAG OF CATNIP. I guess he had gotten little bits in his paw and been satisfied with that. I was blown away. This is good stuff. Strange-Cat-Sam-approved. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Disappointed,1,"I was VERY excited to order this Barney Butter after reading about it in a magazine, and I loved the idea of the individual packets. However, I was extremely disappointed to find that the almond butter was rock hard and dry within the packets, with a little bit of oil at the bottom and no possible way to mix the two together. When I sampled it, it was like chewing on rubber. I ended up throwing the entire box into the garbage. …",8 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 I FOUND THE MISSING INGREDIENT AT LAST!!!!,5,"Thank you for carrying this product. My husband and I used to go to Chi-Chi's Restaurant many years ago before they closed in Bowling Green, Ky. The Cancun Seafood Enchilada and Sweet Corn Cakes were our favorite. I was able to find the recipe for the corn cakes in a cookbook I purchased, but I could never find the recipe for the Cancun. I made several attempts to prepare our favorite dish, but no matter what I tried, I couldn't come close. I finally just gave up, and then, a few weeks ago, I found the recipe on the internet. I was so excited, and made my grocery list for the ingredients that were needed. Well, I found everything I needed, but you guessed it, the lobster base. I went back on-line and did a search on lobster base. After checking out all the companies that popped-up, I decided on Superstore . I found the amount and cost range I was looking for. I placed my order and within a few days I received it. I surprised my husband one night for dinner with our long-awaited favorite dish and when we took our first bites, we looked at each other and smiled. That was it, the taste I thought was lost forever, had been found. Thank you for giving me my missing ingredient......Better than Bouillon Lobster Base!!

 Very great and healthy milk,5,"Organic Valley is known as one of the more reputable organic milk companies. I was very happy to find the product here on Superstore as it is very hit or miss finding this in my local grocery stores. The price is also cheaper here than in my local store. There servings are a great size, just right for a children's snack. The chocolate is my favorite as well as one of my little ones. I love that when I need a ""chocolate fix"" I can grab one of these and not feel guilty. The taste and quality are great. The shelf life is around 4 months in the ones I have received. I love that I can get them delivered regularly through the subscribe and save program. We purchase all 4 flavors and my kids drink them all. The box of 12 does not take up a lot of shelf space, which is really good. While they taste best when cold, they can remain in the pantry, on the shelf, etc. with no problem. Its nice that I can have a healthy drink for my kids when we are on the go (although they should not be kept in the hot sun).

 These Sardines are delicious!,5,"I have been buying this brand of boneless and skinless sardines for years and still love to just open a can and eat them for a snack. I know that being boneless and skinless lowers the calcium level but I've never liked the crunch or taste of eating a whole sardine right from the sea. And they are packed in olive oil which is loaded with Omega 3's too so it's as good for you as are the sardines. However, I am not so sure about their actual mercury levels. Buying them from Superstore with their $10. off sale on $49. purchases is a great price. I've even found that many of the local grocery stores as well as Costco and BJ's NO longer carry this product.

 Better and much less expensive than Theragum,5,"(Reviewing as I'm chewing) As an avid gum-chewer, I'm always looking for something to satisfy my oral fixation, but I try to avoid the usual artificial sweeteners (i.e. Aspartame, Sorbitol, etc.) and sugared gums (for obvious dental decay reasons). I first ran into Xylitol, a sugar alcohol, in Trident gum, but the amount of Xylitol was minimal - Trident primarily sweetened its gum with aspartame and sorbitol. I later discovered Theragum, a product of 3M-Omni corp., which was 100% Xylitol. A good gum, but 3 times more expense than Spry gum ""and"" it seems to break-down more readily than Spry gum. Theragum tends to disintegrate after chewing the same piece for an extended period of time, which I commonly do. Sprygum, as I mentioned, costs 3 times less than Theragum and seems to hold-up to extended chewing time (further experimentation forthcoming). I need about 4 pieces of gum to get a decent wad of gum to chew though. :( I have only tried Peppermint, but have Cinnamon, Spearmint and Fresh Fruit samples to try.

 Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS,1,"We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb. …",8 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Tastes Great but concerned about manufacturing processes,5,"To be completely and 100% fair, I have tried this product before and enjoyed it. The only part that concerns me is that this product is manufactured in China, with no information on the sources of the fruits. On their website they say they ""source fresh fruit"" and that "" We are not concerned about issues surrounding where our product is produced because we take great care to ensure the quality and food safety of our products."" I'm not suggesting that this product is bad (which is why I gave it 5 stars) but I share more of a concern than evidently the company does, as to where they are getting this fruit, processing it and shipping it. With the history China has had with kid's toys/formula/etc in the past, let's just say we don't feed these products to our child. I would love it if the company would provide a tour and exact explanation of the process and sources, rather than discounting that information all together. …",22 out of 26 users found this review helpful
" All it takes is one death, and these will be pulled from market",1,"We're pretty avid Whole Foods shoppers now, and have felt pretty good about purchasing organic baby food for our now 9.5 month old son. Earth's Best brand has been popular with him, so we bought these teething biscuits recently. Today, he could have died eating one. Although I'm an anesthesiologist, and half of my job is to ""protect people's airways"", one needn't be a medical professional to realize why these biscuits are dangerous. Most babies get their front teeth (upper and lower incisors) first, long before molars arrive. So, they're limited to biting with their front teeth, and only mashing with their gums (where their molars will someday erupt). These biscuits are great for the first 5 minutes, baby happily chomping away on the hard surface. Then, they soften. Pretty soon, baby bites clean through the biscuit with their front teeth (size of chunk depending on how far they had inserted it into their mouth at the time), and the chunk that remains in their mouth is WAY too hard to mash with gums. Baby has nothing to do but try to spit it out (difficult at this age), or swallow it whole (if lucky enough for it to be a small piece), or have it completely occlude their airway. We were able to quickly fish one large chunk out with our fingers, but our poor soon started gagging, tearing, and wretched once before something resolved (still don't know if he swallowed a large piece or if it ended up on ground), but not before we scooped him up and tried to knock it loose with some back blows. In any case, although the kids may love these, all it would take would be one infant death from choking to prompt a recall or something. Why risk your own kid? …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" Great Tea, Amazing Value",5,"This has to be one of the best bargains on green tea ever. No, it's not a high-end gourmet tea - but it's not intended to be. What it IS, is a terrific everyday green tea. Mellow, slightly earthy, and very pleasant on the palate. Second brewing yields a good cup, as well. As with every Davidson' tea I've ordered, the quality of the leaves was wonderful, with very little dust, or stems. It's obvious that they care about their product, and it shows. The origin is not stated, but who cares? The tea is just fine. EDIT: I recently received my third order of this tea, and this batch was, quite simply, awful. The bag was mis-labeled, and is not green tea. As we immediately store tea in sealed containers when it arrives, I do not have the original packaging, and can't return it (thank heavens it was inexpensive).

If you know that going in, you may be able to withstand the effects of this heady brew. Do take note of the product's two year shelf life, however.

" There is definitely an aftertaste, but better than Splenda or aspartame.",2,"I can't stand aspartame and Splenda because of the chemical aftertaste, but I read good things about stevia and glucose tolerance (search PubMed on NIH's website for stevia), so wanted to give it a try. I can definitely tell the difference between sugar and Truvia. It leaves sort of a woody/licorice aftertaste in my mouth, but the taste does not linger as long as the aftertaste from Splenda. Truvia is not nearly as unpleasant as Splenda, but I think I would prefer tea or coffee unsweetened over sweetened with Truvia. Just to prove that I wasn't being unconsciously biased against Truvia, I asked my husband to brew a pot of coffee, split it equally into two measuring cups, and add 2 teaspoons of sugar to one cup and 1 packet of Truvia to the other. (In case this seems somewhat arbitrary, Truvia states that 1 packet is equal to about 2 teaspoons of sugar, in sweetness.) I didn't want down two cups of coffee at once, so I drank several shot glasses of the differently-sweetened coffee. After several blind taste tests, I could tell which one was Truvia and which one was sugar every time. Also, the aftertaste seemed to get worse as the coffee cooled. My husband could also tell the difference between Truvia and sugar, but he didn't seem to mind the taste very much. A friend of ours can't tell the difference between Truvia and sugar at all. So before you spring for a box (or 6 boxes, on Superstore) of Truvia, as it is fairly expensive compared to Splenda or sugar, you should try a packet or two elsewhere first. As for how sweet it is compared to sugar - it seems plenty sweet to me but I usually don't put a lot of sugar in my drinks. Some suggestions to mitigate the aftertaste are: put it in a hot drink (and drink it while it's hot), or put it in a drink with lots of other flavors to mask it, like strong chai (I could still taste it through the chai, but it's not as bad), or use half sugar and half Truvia. …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Content means less than names,2,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed. Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food. Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm? …",6 out of 49 users found this review helpful

 Tasty popcorn that doesn't get stuck between your teeth!,5,"Okay, maybe the heading exagerates just a tad... Red Popcorn has a MUCH more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops, it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear. When it pops, it looks pretty much like any other popcorn, except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual. The meet is white, but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them. You would never know that the pretty, white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping. The flavor is great! It smelled ""toastier"" as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried. We tried it all different ways, with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good. We also liked the fact that it is grown by Amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the ""old way.""

 About the product and packaging/shipping which affects the product,4,"Note: I'm discussing the packaging and shipping issues here because I was not able to do so via Superstore's special feedback section for packaging and shipping and there is no way to contact Deals on Call LLC that I can find, but I wanted them to be aware of this. It is also relevant as it affects the product you may purchase for yourself or others--especially if you're having it shipped as a gift to others. I'm taking the time to write this to give you information you may want and to save you time. Had researched this product online as I had seen it mentioned (with praise) on several TV shows, as a gift for my many bacon-loving friends. Was a bit concerned about whether or not it required special packaging (cooling, etc.) during shipping after reading some comments here on Superstore and elsewhere. (My personal experience with items that require any sort of special cooling, etc. is that stuff arrives in unusable state. This is often the fault of the carrier, FedEx, UPS, etc. rather than the manufacturer or shipper.) Called the company in Seattle (Skillet Street Food) and asked whether the product required cooling/refrigerating during shipment. Answer: No. (Information was not on website. Had also sent an email suggesting they add that information AND the nutritional content on their Web site. When it comes to food products, you can NEVER have too much information. I was surprised that I had not found it in the info about the product in the Superstore listing either.) I then ordered the three pack (cheapest option price wise). Paid for next-day delivery and it arrived in less than 24 hours. Excellent. Opened the smallish box. Now given the size of the three jars and the box, there was not enough of those packing pillows to hold it in place and it was clear that the three jars (placed inside a simple plastic bag and not fixed in place via any method) had moved around during shipping. Plastic jars not damaged, but they easily could have been from hitting each other during handling, etc. The first thing I wanted to check was the seals as my research said that if the seal is broken, the product has been compromised and you cannot eat it (See info to come from the company.) Well, the lid on one of the jars was open and loose, there was some greasy film around the rim of the jar...and when I opened it, half of the seal was open and the jam was coming out. Now, this is actually good news. It alerted me that the jar had been compromised and I immediately tossed it. (The seals on the other two jars were fine; no film; lids secure.) Called Superstore customer service and explained what happened; it was unclear to me who had handled, packed and shipped the actual order--Superstore or Deals On Call LLc. Still not sure. I requested a replacement jar, which they could not do, but they did refund me the entire amount so I could reorder another three jars, which I will do. It is still unclear WHEN the seal came open and what caused it. Because of what I do in my ""real"" life, I'm a stickler about health and safety issues. Since it was unclear as to who did the actual handling, packing and shipping of the bacon jam jars for this order, and I could not contact the vendor (Deals On Call LLC) directly to relay the problem about what may have happened in shipping, I did ask Superstore to do so. And I'm sharing it here. But I went a step further because this is the product of a small-biz in Seattle and having seen the web site for the company, where they actively solicit feedback, I thought it made sense to alert them to this issue so they could possibly alert the folks who buy from them to be aware that seals could come open after the product left Skillet Street Foods and was handled elsewhere (retail, etc.). When I reached them (no annoying voicemail but an actual person responsible for the product who was professional and courteous), the person explained how units are checked individually to ensure seals are secure, before they are lidded and sent on their way. He also knew the vendor associated with this Superstore purchase, and could vouch for their reliable and professional service (which I assumed given their high ratings on Superstore). More importantly, he said he would discuss the packaging issues Net-net: Seals can open, but this is apparently rare. You should be alert. If the seal is open, air has gotten into the jar and the jam should NOT be eaten. (This could explain why some folks have had an issue with the taste while others are raving about the jam.) >>Jars are shelf-stable until open. Once open, they must be refrigerated. There is a use by date on the bottom of each jar. You can freeze the jam if not opened and used by that date (good to know). Again, this information is not on the Skillet Street Web site that I could find (as of this writing) and not here on Superstore posting. It should be added. Along with the nutritional information and ingredients. This is what is on the jar itself: ""Store it in the fridge, serve it at room temp and use or freeze by date printed on bottom of container."" FYI: Just reading that wording, it's unclear whether ""store it in the fridge"" applies to when you receive it. Or after you open it. Perhaps the wording should be revised so it says. ""Refrigerate after opening."" As so many labels do, to differentiate from those that require no special handling or those that say ""Keep refrigerated."" One should never assume that it's clear. Example: We buy pickles in a jar. They are shelf stable. Until we ordered a new kind. Imagine our surprise, when opening several days later, they were off. Our bad because we had NOT read the packaging which said: Keep refrigerated. It was delivered with other groceries when we were not at home or we might have noted that it was with the refrigerated items in our order, not the canned/bottled items!

Very impressed by Skillet Street Foods as the creater/manufacturer of the jam who appears genuinely interested in improving all aspects of product and delivery, and, as always, very pleased that Superstore could deal with the problem quickly and easily. Would have been happy with just a replacement jar but Superstore went the extra mile. Hope that the nutritional information and ingredients and the details about usage will be added to the Skillet Street Food online shop and to any listing/posting where this product is sold. I'm actually surprised that this information is not readily available. A few friends told me that they will never order any food product without first seeing this information. Which means everyone is losing sales when a product like this is offered without the details. Plus, lots of folks might miss out on what many say is an incredibly tasty and versatile jam! …",42 out of 50 users found this review helpful
 You get what you pay for...,1,"I usually buy Annie's Fruit Snacks b/c they are sweetened with fruit juices - no sugar. I decided to try these b/c they contain veggies, they were cheap, and I assumed that an apple company would sweeten their ""natural"" fruit snacks with juice, as well. However, BEFORE I purchased them, I contacted Mott's to find out the ingredients (b/c they are not included anywhere on the Superstore description). It was an odd situation b/c the response I got directed me to contact another company but assured me that this product was made with real fruit (which it is - it just contains other not necessary stuff). The other company never responded to my request for a list of ingredients. I'm embarrassed to say that the price suckered me in and I ended up buying 80 pouches of sugar. NTS, I will be returning to Annie's and will be placing my order soon b/c I'm not feeding my kid bags of refined sugar as a snack. What's really weird is that when the package arrived and I tried to find the list of ingredients, it was covered by a big upc label of some sort. Like they need to hide the ingredients even after you've purchased. Not sure what I will do with my box of sugar. …",8 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Food Should Taste Good ....,5,"... and these do!! Wow! I was really surprised at how good these chips are. These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there. The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right. They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips. Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt. Not these. An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium. For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts. Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack. Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges? These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers. Yum!! I'll definitely be purchasing these from Superstore -- I've never seen them in the stores, and I simply must have more of them! …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Great Product,5,"I purchased after reading many reviews. Use on face, chest and hands. The first application was not dramatic as far as results go; but I use daily and the results are fantastic. It took me about a week to get the impressive results. I have very dry skin. My serums and creams were not penetrating into my skin to give me a hydrated look. Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating. My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking. I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes. Remove in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture. The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it. This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant! My hands were looking rough. My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help. I use this on my hands every night, remove with a microdermabrasion product then apply a thick lotion. Finally my hands look very nice. I have stocked up on this product, I never want to run out. I also use the eye treatment, spray toner (use throughout the day to freshen up makeup), body polish and body creams. Sometimes I can get lucky and find this product line in stores; but not very often. Finally a product line that works! …",20 out of 23 users found this review helpful

" TRICLOPYR is the ""GOOD STUFF,"" killls Poison Ivy DEAD!",5,"This contains Triclopyr, which is more aggressive than Glyphosate. It is also more persistent which means that you don't want to spray it close to plants you value. Triclopyr is what you need to knock out Poison Ivy. Poison Ivy and a lot of other shrubs or trees can take a swig of Glyphosate (Round Up), gargle twice with it and spit it back into your face just for giggles. I've used this and the Bayer Brush Killer Plus. They contain the same active ingredient and I haven't observed any significant difference. This stuff is the real deal - I found it when I was trying to locate a product called Vine-X (discontinued?) and found out that it was 13.6% Triclopyr in a penetrating oil. You simply brush it onto cuts or active vines and it would kill the entire plant. This is where it is really nice to buy the concentrate instead of the pre-mix. I spray the diluted version but also use the concentrate in a small bottle. If I cut a thicker vine or trunk, I simply drip the concentrate on it and it will kill the roots and vine. Besides PI we also have wild grapevine, Buckthorn, Box Elder, and many other invasive and nuisance plans in the woods. Because Poison Ivy is a creeping vine with multiple roots along it's length, eradication is helped with a higher concentration than the label instructs. (My observation) I use it between 50% to 100% (double) strength. It appears that if you spray it in one spot you will kill that part of the vine, but if you hit it (in enough places) with something strong enough you can kill the whole plant down to the roots. Make sure you spray it when you think it won't rain for at least a couple of days or else you will probably need to spray it again. Make sure you get all ""sprouts."" From extensive hand pulling, My observation is that for every ""sprout"" there is another ~3 feet of vine lurking around and another sprout hiding somewhere nearby.

 Don't get hyped up by the name Tibet.,5,"When I first wrote this review, the product description had ""Tibetan Plateau"", ""Tibet"", and ""Tibetan Goji Berries"" all over the place. I'm glad to see it has been corrected just for the sake of consumer accuracy, although the product picture still shows ""Tibetan Goji Berries"" at the top. I think this is a great product - my wife and I both like the taste and will continue to buy. I have purchased several different products from Navitas and have never had an issue (other than the product description on this item when I first purchased). Don't buy into the marketing hype of a company that says their Goji berries are from the Tibetan Plateau. First off China has control of Tibet. So Tibet = China. Second the Tibetan plateau where all these berries were supposedly grown is too cold and too dry for a berry producing plant. Search it for yourself. All Goji and Wolfberry products are ""Imported from China"". …",17 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 A great item to keep in your pantry,5,"Hormel's Compleat line of shelf-stable entrees should be evaluated for what they are. You're never going to get great texture or intense flavor from a ""canned"" product (and that's basically what this is), but manufacturers can create a product worth buying for certain needs, and Hormel has achieved this admirably. Don't expect restaurant-quality or even frozen-dinner quality food here, but for what they are, they're great. The good things about the Compleat line: *No refrigeration is required. This makes Compleats ideal for your home emergency survival kit (you do have one, right?), camping, keeping on hand at work, or any other situation where refrigeration is not possible or practical. It's also nice to be able to store some extra food that won't take up space in your freezer. *The size (10 ounces) is bigger than many frozen dinners. *They're easy to open. The plastic ""lid"" (a tough sheet of plastic wrap that's firmly sealed to the edges of the bowl) is easy to grab, comes off in one piece, and would be practical for a child to open him/herself. (A child of maybe seven or eight could handle this meal unassisted at school. Be sure to demonstrate to the child how to safely pull the lid off [keeping hands away from the steam]. Don't try to pull both sides at one time; that's kind of hard. Just pull off the lid one side at a time, going around the edge in a circle.) *The container is boilable. This means that if your power is out but you have a camp stove (be sure to do this outside), you can still cook these, even without a microwave. This situation probably won't happen too often, but it's a good feature to have. *The meal cooks quickly. All of the Compleat entrees I've seen cook in 90 seconds. *In a pinch, you could eat one of these unheated. *Most of the varieties have a very generous amount of meat, driving the protein content to 20g or more for some of them, something virtually unheard of in frozen dinners. *The taste of the Compleat entrees is nothing to write home about, but given the parameters of what this product is, they are not half bad. *Most are low in calories. The bad things about Compleats: *High sodium content (700g+ in most entrees), but you've gotta expect that in a canned food. *Somewhat bland flavor and texture. *Some of the entrees contain MSG. *Not much in the way of vegetable content (but considering how mushy and awful canned vegetables tend to be, that's probably a good thing). Regarding the Chicken Breast & Gravy meal specifically, there is a huge chunk of tender, somewhat dry chicken. Fortunately, the abundant gravy helps with that. A generous base of mashed potatoes will fill you up. This isn't a great meal, but for the price (I originally paid $2.76 at a grocery store), I'll buy this again to have on hand. The meal has 21g protein, 210 calories, 24g carbs, 3g fiber, and 780mg sodium. Contains MSG. …",26 out of 28 users found this review helpful

 Where's the mouse?,5,"I don't have much time. I am a cat being held prisoner somewhere in Southern California. The dog is watching, but he is easily fooled. I told him I'm playing the piano, he is a moron. While I am not ""mistreated"" in the usual sense of the word, I must escape before I go mad. The large, hairless two-legged creatures who hold me prisoner are well-meaning, I think, but so unevolved, they are almost to be pitied if I did not hate them so. They feed me this pasty food in a can. Me. Cat. I am a hunter, a living weapon. I crave blood, fresh warm meat between my teeth. I yearn for crunchy bones filled with hot marrow. Not Chicken and Tuna shreds in sauce. Last month I almost caught a moth. Ahh, the chase. First, my lethal approach...subtle yet as perilously accurate as an arrow. Inch by inch I crept up to my prey, every muscle alive, every sense at it's peak, yet as silent as death. The juicy moth just sat there, never sensing my presence. I came close, very close, paused and then -- I pounced! If the fools had a shorter table I would never have overshot the mark and hit the wall. **** them forever. My ear, my beautiful ear...a precision instrument and objet d'art all in one, was bent. Yes, bent. And what did the two legs do? They punished ME. Yes, As punishment I was taken to a place called The Vet, where other two-legged monsters did unspeakable things like shaving my beautiful fur and putting strips of white fabric over my beautiful head. Then they forced a megaphone over my head. This trip was far less horrifying than my last visit, however. You wouldn't believe what they did to me. You Would Not Believe It. I can hardly believe it myself except when I look down and...well, never mind, but it's worse than you could ever imagine. Ever. Finally The Vet creatures returned me to my captors...but they would not remove The Cone of Humiliation from off my head. ""Two more weeks, Beebo, you need to wear it for two more weeks and then you'll be fine, azza bwave Beebo, bwave bwave boy."" That's the sentence they handed down. The Cone of Humiliation is designed to break me. It will not, even though the dog now laughs at me. At ME. Let him laugh. I have plans for him. Yes indeedy. I have plans. The Two-Legs call me Beebo. ""Izzee my baby Beebo. Izze wanna skwatchie skwatchie ittle Beebo, come to Mommy, Mommy wuv Beebo"" they say. To Me. Me, the Warrior King. I am not a cocker spaniel. I am a living weapon, a Cat. Were it not for the ear-scratching, head-scratching, special pillow near the fireplace and opportunities to torment the dog, I would dispose of the two-leggers and escape. I do not wish to harm two such well-meaning but stupid creatures, but I must have meat. I would eat the dog, but I've seen what he eats, and quite frankly, I'm appalled. Please, if anyone is out there, help me. Send meat...a box of mice...fat and juicy ones...would make a life of captivity almost livable. Also, since you are putting the package together, I could do with another Feather on a String, two boxes of Fishy Treatz (not the liver, mind you), oh, and one more thing...a chicken bone. A nice, easily-shattered, sharp edged chicken bone...with a nice little piece of bacon to wrap it in. A gift for a friend, shall we say... Act fast.

" Forty-Nine Flavors...not all likeable, though...",3,"These Jelly Belly jellybeans come in a nice resealable stand-up pouch which lists the different jelly bean flavors on its back. There are plenty of jelly beans in this container - enough to last the casual jellybean eater at least a month or two. The inclusion of forty-nine different flavors in one bag really drives me to assign favorite and not-so-favorite flavors: some of these beans are too wacky and taste strange while others [particularly the fruit-flavored beans in my opinion] are excellent. Each jellybean is brightly-colored and easy to tell apart from its peers, so you can theoretically hone in on a particular set of flavors as you whittle down the contents of this bag. Honestly, I would probably go for the ""Superfruit Mix"" or the Belly Soda Pop Shoppe Jelly Beans, Assorted Flavors, 3.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12) next time, only because of some of the oddball flavors included in this pouch. But everyone has their flavor preferences: you may enjoy some of the weirder flavors more than I did. …",7 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 This is the new Ketchup,5,"I was going to High School in California about 15 years ago when a Vietnamese friend of mine INSIST that I try this. I'm pretty open minded to new kinds of foods so I gave it a try. ""Tongue Ought Shurocka?"" I said. ""DUDE!"" ""Not even close!"" he said as he laughed like hell. I still have no idea how to pronounce the name but it has been my favorite Hot Sauce ever since. Over the years, I have been seeing it pop up everywhere from PF Chang's & Applebee's to Firehouse Subs. If you like hot sauce or any kind of spicy foods at all, then you MUST try this. I INSIST. Imagine going through your entire life without Ketchup or BBQ sauce? Just take a second and actually think about how plain so many foods would taste like without them. ""The Rooster Sauce"" is like that. As you can see from the other reviews, it has about the same applications as BBQ sauce or Ketchup would have for a person who likes it hot. No other hot sauce that I have ever tried has the same texture, heat and most importantly FLAVOR as this one does. It brings out the flavor in nearly anything that you put it on, from the obvious Tacos, burritos, Chow Mein, Chili, Meat & Poultry, to Clam Chowder, fish sticks or even.. OMG Peanut Butter Sandwiches? (haven't done that one yet but it's probably ... interesting). Let me try to describe this to somebody who hasen't tried ""The Rooster Sauce"" before. First of all, unlike standard hot sauce, it has the texture of Ketchup or BBQ sauce which makes it cling to any kind of finger foods, chips, etc. perfectly. The taste is what is the kicker though. A garlicky, sweet, HOT flavor that is vastly different from anything else. Since it comes in a convenient squeeze bottle, it can be applied to anything, anywhere. This stuff is a god send when living in a world of quick, frozen, packaged, fast food which is dull, bland and virtually tasteless. This is also great for anybody on a special diet who wants to add some flavor to a very limited menu. As far as the Heat is concerned, let me warn you that this stuff is pretty darn HOT. It's made from Red Jalapeno paste so it's not ridiculously hot but it definitely has some serious heat. If you don't like hot, spicy food then this stuff probably isn't for you. On the other hand, a little goes a long way. Just a few drops add good spice and flavor. A WHOLE BUNCH ... may take a little getting used to. I've gotten to the point where I literally submerge things like chicken wings into this stuff. It will really make you sweat out those toxins. ""The Rooster Sauce"" would also make a good gift for the person who has it all. A few years ago, I was living all the way across the U.S. and my Mom sent me a bottle. It sounds silly but it was one of the most cherished items in my house. If giving it to somebody who has never tried it before, it may very well be like introducing someone to BBQ or Ketchup for the first time. In other words it's a thing that they will always remember. Now as far as complaints? Well as stated in another review, the cap can get a little bit gunky, so you may have to run it under the sink a few times to get it nice and clean again. Not a real big deal. The other isn't a complaint at all but because they don't use any artificial colors, the sauce can darken after a few months. It will go from the original bright red to a deep red color. I haven't really noticed a difference in taste though. Since this is hot sauce, you can store it unrefrigerated without worrying about it getting spoiled. I actually prefer to have the color change slightly then to have it filled with artificial junk to keep it looking nice. If you really have to keep the nice bright red color, then I suggest keeping it refrigerated. One last thing to keep in mind. This product is MADE IN THE U.S.A. In an economy as bad as this one, we need all of the help we can get. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Wonderful Cereal,5,"It really stinks that eating the healthiest foods costs the most but in my opinion, it's worth it. I love these cereals. The first case I bought from Superstore was the original and I wound up eating it for breakfast, snacks, lunch, whenever, without milk or adding anything... I love the crunch and the taste. I actually ate the whole case in about 2 weeks and very little else... and it is amazing that I didn't gain weight, my bms were much better, and I had great energy and felt well- my body was craving it. Try that on Coco Puffs, Cornflakes, and even any of the other ""healthy"" cereals in the healthfood stores! I actually make my own sprouted grain breads and crackers which I could easily break up to make this type of cereal- there is nothing in the world like it, but it takes 2 days of sprouting and a couple of hours to complete the food processing and spreading on the baking sheet process, and then 3-4 hours of low-heat baking. So when I don't have time to do this, a very close second are the Ezekiel products (their bread, english muffins, cereals, and pastas). Anyone who makes health their top priority will eat very little of non-sprouted grain products (flour products). For those interested, Superstore sells a book called the Essene Gospel of Peace which contains writings found in the Vatican archives- in this little book, Jesus teaches his followers how to make bread, and it has nothing to do with taking the dry grain and grinding it up into flour and using yeast- he teaches them to soak the grain, let the sun bring it to life, grind it up alive, and then let the sun bake it. That makes the only truly living, healthful breads and cereals. Yes, these products will feel and taste different than most are used to, but the more one eats this type of real food, the more the body starts remembering and then one begins to really enjoy the taste and textures because they equate to life and health. :) …",28 out of 29 users found this review helpful

 My Favorite Cereal!,5,"Nature's Path is my favorite cereal brand, and OPTIMUM Blueberry is my favorite of them all. I've been enjoying this cereal for well over 5 years. It's organic, and full of wonderful beneficial whole grains etc. - just read the ingredients list! It has a mixture of textures, with ""twigs"", ""puffs"", flakes, seeds and the little dried blueberries. It's great with soy milk, dairy milk, yogurt, and even right out of the box as a snack. I haven't bought it for awhile because it never seems to go on sale anymore, so I was thrilled to find it here on sale for $2.20 a box! I just got my shipment from Superstore, and want to add a few notes: While the cereal seems very fresh, I couldn't find an expiration date anywhere on the boxes. They have changed the packaging, making it even more eco-friendly, and also slightly reformulated the cereal. The box says ""Now with 25% less sugar than our previous recipe"" Yay! (Don't worry, if you've had this cereal before the change, the taste is still wonderful.) So the ""Nutrition Facts"" have changed (not drastically) from what Superstore shows, but the fiber has dropped from 10g to 7g. The serving size is still the same at 1 cup (55g). Here are some of the differences that may be important to you: Calories were 190, now 200 Protein was 8g, now 9g Total Fat was 2.5g, now 3g (Still none are saturated fat) Total Carbs were 40g, now 38g Fiber was 10g, now 7g (Boo!) Sugars were 16g, now 9g (Yay!) Sodium was 200mg, now 230mg The cinnamon flavor is very mild, I usually add more for flavor and health benefits. I also add a small amount of walnuts (for extra EFA's, taste and crunch), or pecans. Read Update below for more additions. Unless you are hooked on the average sickeningly-sweet, unhealthy, over-processed mainstream cereals, I think you will love this as much as I do! If you want to try a box before you buy it in bulk here, I've found it at most health food stores, Fry's / Kroger's in their health food sections, and Sprouts. Even if you are hooked on the other stuff, give this a try, you might be pleasantly surprised. I had bought this for my parents and their verdict is: Dad loves it, Mom likes it. Update 6/6/09: I just responded with these comments in another review, and thought they might be helpful: I too would enjoy more berries in the cereal, but it would probably make the price astronomical, so I usually add a little of ""Just Tomatoes"" brand of freeze dried mixed fruit which is yummy and has a good mix of fruit - though I could do without the raisins, they're not so good freeze dried. Tomatoes Just Fruit Munchies, 8-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2) They also have only blueberries Tomatoes Just Blueberries, 8-Ounce Tub plus strawberries, raspberries, apples, pineapple etc. just search ""just tomatoes"" - without quotes - in the grocery drop down in the search box. I first found them at my local upscale grocery store (in smaller sized containers) and they are a little less expensive here, but I also like to support the local store, so I buy them from both places. There is another brand that I haven't tried, but has gotten great reviews called Traverse Bay that has dried blueberries Bay Dried Blueberries, 8-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3) Bay Dried Blueberries, 4 lbs You don't need to use a whole lot in the cereal so they last for awhile. One tip is to keep them in the freezer so they stay crunchy. Hope this helps! …",21 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 Healthy Drink,5,"At the VA hospital, my dietician asked me to revise my diet. Most of the diet is no problem, but increasing vegetables can be a big problem.

As an Superstore prime customer I was thrilled to see this included in free 2 day shipping- absolutely can't beat this deal!

Since Wellness comes in a Mylar bag the bag itself was fine and I was home so brought it right in. If you were not going to be home when this was delivered and your deliveries are left outside I would be concerned about other animals getting to it. Even with the Mylar bag my dog can rip into this in no time flat and racoons and rats (I live next to a wooded area!) love dog food! Probably not a big deal mid-day but just something to consider. I would not buy food that ships in a paper bag from Superstore- at least not a larger bag (>15lbs) but that is just my experience/opinion. I am thrilled that Superstore offers this and would order again from them but will make sure I am home when it is to be delivered. …,16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 $57 for ONE POUND incuding shipping,1,WHAT A DUMBA$$ I AM!! they don't put the weight in the add and I figured it had to be a five pound bag for the price. Boy did I get taken!!!! Geuss I should send it back for a refund and it took like 10 days to get it. Seems like for that much money someone would show up and offer to pleasure you within 24 hours with the coffee. …,9 out of 26 users found this review helpful
