 Best vanilla flavor,5,"So I have tried all the Torani vanilla syrups and this one tastes the best to me by far. The french vanilla is too sweet and fake tasting, the plain vanilla is fine, but this one imparts a more intense vanilla flavor. I'm a huge fan. My kids mostly love it to flavor their milk, cold or hot. Hey, it doesn't stain like chocolate milk, so that's a plus. Also adds awesome flavor to cocoa. We're not coffee drinkers but I'm sure people use it for that, and I have also tasted ice cream flavored with this that was the best soft serve ice cream of my life. Also delicious made into Italian sodas, using club soda, 2 oz. of syrup, and some half and half. Be forewarned that the three-pack usually comes in plastic bottles, rather than glass. A plus for shipping, maybe not as pretty sitting on a shelf, and less recyclable. Just FYI. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Must have been a contaminated batch,1,"We bought a case of 12 12 oz cans back in April. Just now opened the first can. Wow. Consistency of vomit, grayish tinge, and a vile odor. Opened a second can -- exactly the same. No way were we going to feed it to our dog. Something was clearly wrong. We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase. Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA. …",20 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 The best of the energy chews!,5,"I'm a runner doing 30-50 miles a week and am currently (9/10) training for the Chicago Marathon. I've tried all of the gels and chews that are out there and these are my favorite. I don't like gels as that squirt of mush activates my gag reflex. Plus you always need water with them. I've tried all of the other brands of energy chews (I think); Sharkies (good but sticky and not very tasty), Clif Shot Bloks (nice package, very sticky on the fingers), GU Chomps (super sticky and caused some nausea), PowerBar Gel Blasts (very good but tough to chew if cold). The Honey Stinger chews are very easy to chew and you don't need water. They don't stick to your teeth either. The main selling point for me is that they taste good and don't cause nausea no matter what. I'm sticking with these ones. …",24 out of 24 users found this review helpful

" Buy American birch, not Chinese corn cob extract",1,"There are two mainstream commercial sources of Xylitol - Corn and Hardwood trees such as Birch. Many rumors have circulated on the internet regarding the benefits and or drawbacks of either. Here you can gather the facts. The structure of Xylitol does not differ between corn based and birch based xylitol. However, it is a fact that the vast majority of corn based Xylitol found in North America is imported from China. Almost all imported Chinese Xylitol is derived from corn. Also a fact is that most commercial sources of corn itself are genetically modified. This is not true of birch trees. The process utilized in making birch based Xylitol is envirnmentally green and sustainable, in fact the process often uses caommercial scrap that may otherwise be discarded. So is Birch better than corn? You be the judge, each individual can make up their mind. Prices are almost the same, if the description doesn't say American birch you can assume it's Chinese corn. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Perfect fit,5,"These are the PERFECT solution for re-using K-cups. They snap very tightly and handle the Keurig's brewing pressure. I may even be able to reuse these lids a few times. Each K-cup has a filter inside that does not get punctured by any of the needles. If you tear off the foil top, clean off the filter by rinsing and lightly brushing with a tooth-brush and the letting them dry (if you want), then you can refill them with your own coffee and snap one of these lids on. It works perfectly. I can even store them in my carousel - no leaks, no spilled grounds, no problems at all. It took me 30 minutes to prepare and clean 100 K-cups, 2 days for them to thoroughly dry and about 10 minutes to refill them by dumping the coffee in a stock pot and scooping the K-cups through, then snapping on a lid. No fuss, no muss, no mess. These things are AWESOME! …",32 out of 32 users found this review helpful
 This is NOT the same as gelatin,3,"Ok, so of course this is of no fault of the company and my own fault for not being savvy enough to know the difference. I was trying to purchase a bulk size unflavored gelatin, and ended up with this Instant Clear Gel. I have no use for it that I can think of, but I'm hoping to find some recipes to use it in since I have a pound of it. Well, almost a pound, minus about four tablespoons that I unfortunately tried to use in a home-made marshmallow recipe that called for gelatin. That did NOT turn out nice.

 Suprisingly good tea,5,"of Harrogate, Special Rare Assam Leaf Tea, Doomur Dulling, Loose Leaf, 3.53-Ounce Tin Well, finally and, as it was mentioned by other reviewers, this rare Assam from India is a very good one. I usually drink very strong tea with sugar, no milk. But this truly rare Assam is a pleasure to drink also w/o sugar added. As I tried many different Assams in the past, I had a negative prejudice to the Assam teas (many of the Assams in the past were Chinese though, I guess). Because of the high price, I decided to take a risk - and was rewarded. I do hope that the next batch will be as good as the current one. My spouse is having a cup of tea every morning (the Revolution English Breakfast), I am confident she will like this rare Assam. The only problem here is its price. I may have hard time to keep on buying the Assam from India on a regular basis. Well, X-mas is coming soon. I might survive with the Special Rare Ceylon. There is only one choice here - the Diyagama West. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Great bread...even better pizza crust!,5,"We've been using this bread mix for about a year, as it's the best gluten-free bread mix I've found. I usually make the sweet bread and it's very good, although it would make a great savory bread with herbs as well. I didn't even think to try to make pizza crust with it, as we were using a mix specifically for pizza crust from another popular gluten-free brand, which I didn't really like (too light and thick like a deep dish, but without flavor). I just tried Pamela's bread mix for pizza crust and it was amazing. Not too thick and a bit chewy just like ""real"" pizza crust. I did add the italian spices which are optional but suggested in the directions, and it was wonderful. The first decent pizza we've had since we've been gluten-free! …",90 out of 93 users found this review helpful
 Use in place of  garlic oil...,5,"Truffles remind me of garlic with an added dimension of aromatic appeal. In fact, I'm convinced that you can use truffle oil in many recipes that are compatible with garlic oil. While black truffles are highly prized, you may prefer the white truffle oil in a rice recipe. ""Risotto with Red Bell Peppers and Truffle Oil"" is a good example of a recipe using truffle oil. I actually created this recipe using the URBANI truffle oil and it is superior in flavor! The chicken base gives excellent flavor and is less salty than most bouillon cubes which are less flavorful. 1 T. Urbani ""white"" truffle oil 1 T. salted butter 1 chicken liver, chopped, this is optional 1 T. chopped yellow onion 1 T. chopped fresh parsley 1/4 c. chopped celery stalks 1/4 c. chopped red bell pepper 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper 1 tsp. garlic salt 1 c. uncooked Arborio rice 1 T. chicken base 4 c. boiling water Heat the oil (some have told me to add it later, but I don't think it makes much of a difference in this recipe) and butter in a 6-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Fry chicken livers, then add onion, parsley, celery and bell pepper. Cook 5 minutes. Add pepper, garlic salt and rice. Stir until rice absorbs the butter and looks transparent on both ends of the grain. This actually takes 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup of the water with chicken base. Stir until most of the water is absorbed. Continue to add water in 1/2 cup additions for the next 30 minutes. This dish must be continually stirred and is completely done when water is almost completely absorbed and there is a creamy sauce coating the rice. Serve immediately or the creamy sauce will be absorbed into the rice and you will have a drier, but still delicious, dish. Makes 6 servings. Recipe Note: This creamy dish is perfect as an accompaniment to Roast Chicken. Red bell pepper has a dramatic effect on any dish it touches, any remaining bell pepper may be chopped and frozen to be used later for decorating a cream soup. ~The Rebecca Review …",8 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Cheap ingredients in an expensive bottle,1,"This oil was something else a decade or so ago. It was also pricier. When I recently bought it at a local Indian grocer, I was surprised the price had dropped significantly. Hair oils in India are traditionally coconut oil mixed with other essential herbs, extracts etc - which is what I assumed Dabur's would be too. What a disappointment to find this only but an unhelpful formula of 1. Canola oil 2. Paraffinum Liquidum (a fancy name for Mineral oil) 3. Palm Glycerides (Solids as byproducts from hydrogenating Palm oil)...search the internet for contra-indications for these and it should steer you far away...Goes to show, bigger brands are not necessarily better (DABUR is huge in India)Unfortunately my purchase was not from Superstore and I ended up tossing it - so no refund. I would highly recommend pure coconut oil: you can use essential oils to add to its perfume, but sometimes I even use Azulene oil on my scalp. Works like a charm for oily, greasy scalp days... …",31 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 Very disappointed,1,"I ordered 3 packs of 27-count greenie dog chews from Entirely Pets and have ordered this product from various sources for many years. I have now opened the 2nd pack and both were the same: all of the greenies were stuck together in one big lump. I had to forcibly pull them apart. Although I didn't try them myself, it leads me to believe these are old products and probably stale. I will not order from this vendor again, even if it is a buck or so cheaper. …",7 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 love sodastream soda maker but not its syrups,1,"we love sodastream soda maker but not its syrups. my bf is a soda addict, drink soda like water, who sneaks out to a deli, which is at least 15 mins away as the closest ones closed at midnight, for a 2 Liter bottle of cherry coke at 3am in the morning. i bought the sodastream jet starter kit and this sodamix variety pack for him as i don't want to buy bottles of sodas from supermarket, carrying them walking at least 2 flights of stairs, separating the trash for recycle and dragging bags of empty bottles out which he promised he will help but rarely does. i bought sodastream totally because i m lazy but not being eco-friendly at all. the 1st day we received them, he made 4 different flavors and made me to finish them all with him that night. he loves to play with the loud buzz button and constantly needs new bottle for another flavor as the starter kit comes with only 1 bpa free bottle. i never like anything fizzy while he likes it bubbles until his blood fizz like the soda. we tried #1.fountain mist #2.orange #3. lemon-lime #4.diet cola respectively. he hates anything ""diet"" and complained even the non diet syrups taste like diet. the last one he tested from the variety pack was the diet cola as it doesn't come with the regular cola which he craved. i said the diet cola taste like the regular cola n yuck. he agreed with the yuck but blah blah blah about the taste different between the regular coka cola coke n this sodamix diet cola syrup. he believed that the sodamix regular cola syrup must be better than the diet one and planned to get it the next day. suddenly he screamed out ""splen-daaaaa"" in a weird accent while he was reading the ingredients/ nutrition facts. he lost interests in this variety pack and tried to fizz everything drinkable in the fridge: #5. welch's white grape cherry juice just by itself without water, it exploded while the bottle is still intact to the machine, mess everywhere, he said ""errrk"". #6. water+ribena, considering carbonating the juice creates messes, we just carbonated the water and substitute the syrup with something else, with the same amount of the individually packaged syrup from the variety pack, ribena isnt as concentrated, i continued added more ribena but still taste bland and ended up ran out of ribena. #7. we bought the sodamix regular cola from BB&B the today, while pouring the syrup in after carbonating the water, it just splashed all over the counter top and the kitchen floor. better pour it inside the sink. he said it tastes better than the diet syrup but still has a slightly aspartame/weird sugar after taste, not as good as the regular coca cola. #8. carbonated water+OJ: 1/4 cup of carbonated water + 3/4 cup of no pulp OJ = taste is ok, less strong, not fizzy. 1/2 cup of carbonated water + 3/4 cup of no pulp OJ: not fizzy and taste only with a tint of OJ. 1 cup of carbonated water + 1 cup of no pulp OJ, fizzy but bland. We bought the sodamix cherry cola syrup, but we r full from drinking carbonated sugared liquid these 2 days. we will try it and update tomorrow. …",5 out of 28 users found this review helpful
" BAD, do NOT buy!",1,"Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!! Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling ""corn gluten meal"" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google ""U.S. Patent 5,030,268"" you will find out. By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier. Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price. …",13 out of 33 users found this review helpful

 Wonderful Product,5,"Recently, I wanted to ""up the ante"" on my Omega fatty acids so I added Coconut oil to go along with my doses of flaxseed oil and fish oil. Yes, Coconut Oil is a saturated fat, but because it's a medium chain tryclyceride (MCT), it's more easily absorbed by the body and converted into energy, not stored on the body as fat. This product has a nice flavor--I use it in cooking and it doesn't depart any heavy ""coconut"" flavor. Sometimes I just eat a tablespoon. The benefits are tremendous: microbial properties, helps thyroid, liver, pancreas, bones, skin, soothes the digestive tract. The list goes on. I bought one jar for the kitchen and one jar for my bathroom. This product is great to put on right after a bath or shower. Yes it's a bit greasy at first, but rub it in well and let it absorb, then wipe off the excess with a damp towel or wash cloth. Your skin will be satiny smooth. Bonus tip: I give a teaspoon to my dog every day. Studies show dogs' prefrontal brains benefit from this wonder fat. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 I Love the Stuff - Your Mileage May Vary,5,"TV commercials like the vendor uses make me skittish. I wouldn't have gone near this with a ten foot pole had I not been behind a woman in scrubs purchasing some in a convenience store. I asked her if it worked, she was very favorable and her doctor/boss was positive about it as well. I went home, did more research, saw that the results ran the gamut, but I saw no one experiencing any severe side effects. I took the plunge. I have Hashimoto's (hypothyroid) that is under control with medication, but I'd been recently finding myself extremely tired from early afternoon to the end of my work day (and beyond). I started out with half a bottle of 5-hour after lunch and am extremely happy with the result. It's not dramatic - it just gets me from ""tired"" to ""not tired"" for the afternoon and early evening. I've experienced none of the side effects that others have, but two things that I'm doing are (1) not drinking on an empty stomach, and (2) only using 1/2 bottle. I'm by no means downplaying anyone else's experiences - we're all different, our bodies react differently to all sorts of things, but I would definitely recommend to anyone to give it a shot. Above all - listen to your body. …",91 out of 128 users found this review helpful
 A considerably healthier alternative to deep fried pork rinds,5,"These pork rinds fry in their own fat rather than having to be deep fried which is a lifesaver if you like pork rinds. I'm not the biggest fan, but sometimes I'm kind of hungry and these pack way more protein than the average fatty snack. The only problem is the type of fat it's fried in--melted pig fat from the skin itself! Not particularly healthy, but it's much healthier than the mexican bagged varieties. Since we don't have a microwave (oh my god, how do we get by without one?!), we toast them in a toaster oven on a baking tray for about 10-15 minutes at 375F-400F. They come out great. If you lean closer to 10 minutes, you get a crunchy-porky tasting snack, while if you go past 15, you'll get the typically super-puffed pork rind you'd expect from Cardenas. I can't comment on how well they crisp in the microwave, but I expect it should yield the same results. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 The legendary cake still pleases!  Old-fashioned goodness,5,"For those of you not familiar with the great Urban Legend of the Red Velvet Cake recipe that cost $240 dollars, see Jan Harold Brunvan's series of books on Urban Legends starting with THE VANISHING HITCHIKER available here on Superstore. Most of us know the legend in it's more modern form as the ""Mrs. Field's Chocolate Chip cookie recipe"" that some poor unsuspecting soul requested and was told would cost ""Two-forty"" and who assumed that meant Two Dollars and forty cents only to receive a credit card bill of $240. Needless to say the legend is NOT true, never WAS true & never will be true be it about the cookies, Red Velvet Cake or Waldorf Salad( Another part of the legend). Red Velvet Cake started out as a pretty and regional variant of Devil's Food cake and is really just a wonderfully light chocolate cake with red colouring added to it. It is often topped with either a vanilla buttercream frosting or in more modern times with cream cheese frosting. The Duncan Hines mix is probably a better option than any of the current recipes floating around that are often remnents of the old Urband Legend for a variety of reasons. Many of the legendary recipes have bizarre added ingredients intended to make the recipe look weird or authentic and often call for far more food coloring than is needed, imparting a bitter flavor and ghastly colour to the finished cake. Having had the Duncan Hines mix as a child and again more recently, I can attest to its superiority over most of the existing recipes for Red Velvet Cake. The Duncan Hines Cake Mix has a lovely chocolate flavor and just the right amount of red color to make the final product interesting. When made as a layer cake (preferabley with four thin layers as opposed to two thick ones) and topped with Cream cheese icing, the Duncan Hines Red Velvet Cake makes a wonderfully festive Holiday cake sure to provoke conversation. You may find yourself having to give away a number of the boxes of mix you now have to friends eager to make it themselves and share the intriguing legend. The finished cake truly is a show-stopper! Conventional wisdom is that the cake itself began as a Southern tradition and indeed, it can still be found on the dessert menus of some venerable Southern eateries. The best I ever had was in Nashville at an old Inn but it wasn't all that superior to the Duncan Hines mix which is more moist and lighter in texture than most Tradtional ( as opposed to ""legendary"" ) recipes. You can still find elaborate versions of Red Velvet cake popping up in places such as the Swiss Colony Holiday Catalog but for outragious prices. Do what I do and make your own! Since it is near impossible to find anywhere else, go ahead and order the mix here. Even if you only make it a few times a year, the mix lasts a long time and is a good value when you consider its ""Star Quality"" as a dessert and a natural conversation piece! I know of one mom whose daughter got an 'A' when using the cake as a demonstration of modern Folklore in her high-school social studies class! If all that info isn't enough inducement to try it...just remember..it's chocolate cake for heaven's sake! And...it's pretty! What more could a person want? …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Excellant product - good price,5,Now makes an excellant product and Superstore provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery. The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet. 1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste. Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.

I am not fan of chemistry derived food products such as this or many other which are equally synthetic. This is completely useless to anyone with a desire for other than a hot ""free based"" oil lacking the subtleties of real food with a vast array of odors and taste which only real food has.

 Best Tasting and Healthiest Ready to Drink Meal Replacement Shake,5,"I've been searching since the days that Kashi stopped producing their meal replacement shake mix for something that tastes just as good and is just as good for you. I've tried both available flavors of Orgain and I find the chocolate to have no remnant of soy protein in its taste. The shake tastes great at room temp and amazing chilled. I appreciate that there's some remnants of veggies and fruit in the shake too. Potential downsides: It's not all oil, sugar, and protein....although its mostly that... So it's not exactly as good as sitting down and eating a sandwich. The shake is only made in pre-measured little boxes so there's no opportunity to save some money with a tub of a dry mix. The shakes are expensive too. The trade off is better ingredients, instead of unpronounceable and artificial junk found in say, Slimfast (although that too is mostly oil, sugar, and protein...just from worse ingredient sources). The shake is also not vegan if that's something you're looking for. There's currently only 2 flavors of the shake too, so if variety's your thing, this isn't a good shake to try out long term. I still rate this 5 stars for the ingredients, the taste, and the fairly extensive nutrition content. I wish this had more veggies and fruit in it though...vs. 50 mg each of a fruit and veggie blend. …",40 out of 43 users found this review helpful

 The best food you can give your dog,5,"I struggled with my Rhodesian Ridgeback Mix Muriel and the allergies and sensitive stomach that she inherited. We tried other premium brands such as Wellness, Canidae, Inova and even made our food until we found Nature's Variety. It was actually recommended to us by a vet who specializes in dogs with allergies. Since we started feeding this fantastic food 4 years ago Muriel no longer gets hives, upset stomach or ear infections. Her coat is glossy and she is as energetic as a puppy even though she's almost 9 years old. We also feed Nature's Variety to our 2 cats and our other dog Gilbert (English Fox Hound Mix). They love the chicken instinct but we rotate through the other flavors available and add Nature's Variety Canned and Raw frozen food (Available in a variety of flavors: Rabbit, Salmon, Duck, Beef, Lamb, Bison and Venison). I'm Lucky enough to know the owners of some of Muriel's Litter Mates and am Happy to say that I have made converts of some of them. Their dogs no longer need allergy shots or suffer from hives and upset stomach. As for the ones I haven't converted, I'm still working on them. But don't think this food is just for dogs with problems, this food has changed the health and lifestyle of all our pets. A word of caution this is a very nutrient packed food, no fillers. So you feed about 1/2 as much as you would of many other dry dog food. See the Nature's Variety Feeding Chart at [...] to figure out how much food your dog or cat needs. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Where Are the 3rd Degree Burn Doritos ??,1,"The Frito Lay company is a tease-first they advertise these on the super bowl and then they don't deliver- I have checked several stores on their "" where to Buy"" list and the stores knew nothing about them-I wonder if they even made them??

The frustration has caused the hair on the wolves on my ""three wolf/one moon"" t-shirts hair to fall out, they look like they caught the mange and the moon is no longer full.

" Loved it at first, but it's not very sanitary",3,"I received the mini buster cube and my mini schnauzer had tons of fun with it. I put his kibble dinner in it and he tossed it around and got most of it out. However, over time I could hear that food ""dust"" was being left behind, and I found this product absolutely impossible to open and clean. I tried to open with the instructions many times, asked different people for help, but the opening on the mini cube is so small that I couldn't really get my thumb in there (as the instructions recommend). It was left unused for a bit and then one day when I picked up a small swarm of flies flew out of it! It was so disgusting I ended up throwing it away. If you can manage to open it and clean it, this would be a perfect toy. Perhaps people have better luck with larged sized cube because it might be easier to open, but that one is much too big for my little dog. …",31 out of 33 users found this review helpful
" Main Ingredient is INULIN, not Lo Han!!!",1,"I've been waiting 18 days for this to arrive a finally it did. So I immediately check the ingredients on the back to find that the Main Ingredient is NOT Monk Fruit Concentrate, but INULIN (a cheap starchy filler that IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU and can have severe side effects including anaphylactic shock). I urge you to do your homework on inulin. INULIN has shown to not only feed good bacteria in your stomach, but ALSO bad bacteria such as Klebsiella. Recent studies have shown that inulin encourages the growth of Klebsiella, a bacteria implicated in Ankylosing Spondylitis and in increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut). Although Klebsiella is present in the colon of most people, it is held in check by beneficial bacteria and is harmless WITHIN the colon. But once it gets to other areas of the body, Klebsiella becomes a major cause of pneumonia, infections in the urinary tract and in wounds...and sometimes death. This ""Lo Han"" product also contains silica. Who wants to eat silica...you know, the stuff they also use to make those DO NOT EAT dessicate packets. Swanson ought to list the ingredients in each of their products, cause Purelo IS FAR FROM PURE. This is deceptive marketing at its worst. Yes, i can return it.

I eat tomatoes chopped up on food even though I hate them. So after the first bite and that sudden WTF realization that this tasted nothing like apples or cinnamon I figured I would just trod through it. My gag reflex had other plans! (I just burped and almost threw up again!) I'd like to find what ever taste tester at Cytosport OK'd this flavor and punch him or her in the crotch! I tried to give it to my dogs (they are the left over cleaner uppers) and they looked at me like I was holding a club in my hand! They lick their own butts (one of the dogs used to eat from the cats' litter box) and they wouldn't come near it! They must be smarter than me because I figured that I'd try a second container with whole milk instead of water. So much for bigger brain=smarter. I am going to try to feed the last four containers (uncooked) to the squirrels outside and see if they will eat it. Have you heard the saying ""anticipation of death is worse than death itself""? Well I have six containers of their maple/brown sugar as well. And I am not too manly to admit that I am scared, yes SCARED, to try one! (Burped again, choking back bile!)

 Dry and boring,1,"There needs to be a choice for ZERO stars. While the pictures are nice, and their website (www amazingclubs com) specifically bolds the statement that they have the ""freshest and most mouth-watering desserts"" it is the complete opposite. The first month we received dry brownies that were slightly smashed and crumbling. The second month was a small dry marble bundt cake (no way would it serve 8-12 even if you wanted to) and just now received white chocolate chip cookies that were (you guessed it) dry.

Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth. I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.

 Best GF Bar I've Ever Tasted,5,"Being gluten intolerant it was really nice to see that Pamela's has put out a GF type clif bar (best analogy I had for it). Oddly enough, it does taste like a lighter version of a clif bar (which are usually very dense). Mind you, it would take two of these to fill me like a clif bar does. It's about 2/3rd's the size of a clif bar, it's loaded with oats (this is the first thing you taste) and chocolate chips (which is about the last thing you taste). They are moist and chewy like a soft cookie. About a medium sweetness compared to a regular cookie. Per bar: calories (180), fat (9 gr), carbs (23 gr), fiber (2 gr), and protein (2 gr). Ingredients: GF oats, organic agave, brown rice flour, white rice flour, sweet rice flour, tapioca starch, xanthan gum, organic chocolate chunks (organic natural evaporated can sugar, organic cocoa paste, organic cocoa butter, non-GMO soy lecithin/emulsifier, gluten-free organic vanilla) coconut sugar, monounsaturated safflower oil, organic eggs, almonds, coconut, chia seeds, natural flavors, sea salt, baking soda, xanthan gum. They do note on the packaging that there may be traces of milk, nuts, peanuts or soy because of what they're processed on. Overall, they're pretty darn good. I do taste a bit of baking soda (but I think that's me, I'm pretty sensitive to it) at the end of a bite, but the oats really are the main taste. As someone who eats gluten free would I eat these if I was out and about and had to take a break quickly? Yeah, I would. They're like a soft, oaty cookie, easy to take, good ingredients, and they do taste quite nice. I'll buy them again easily. If I had to pick between a clif bar and Pamela's Whenever Bars. I'd take Pamela's. …",23 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 A fine and sturdy everyday tea,4,"This is a very drinkable blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan black teas from PG Tips, one of the UK's most popular brands. Although some California grocery stores (and Cost Plus World Market) stock this tea, I had not tried it until reading helpful reviews on Superstore. Each PG Tips bag weighs 38 percent more than the Lipton bag (that is available in the USA). As expected, PG Tips makes a stronger brew. Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag. I drink my tea black, but PG Tips is clearly robust enough to maintain character with milk or sweetener. PG Tips is a sturdy, straight-ahead blend with more strength than Lipton's. It is a caffeine-rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands. PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. Does it make better tea? I don't know, but it is a point of differentiation. HINT: PG Tips also makes a Special Blend black tea that is only slightly more expensive in stores. I much prefer the Special Blend to their regular black tea. The PG Tips Special Blend is a very hardy and rich breakfast tea. The Special Blend is more sensitive to longer steeping times (I usually steep mine less than 3 minutes), but I find the taste more complex and satisfying. Cognoscenti typically prefer loose tea. Tea bags contain the less expensive ""fannings"" or ""dust,"" remains from processing loose leaf tea. And with some others brands of tea (not PG Tips), many people can taste the paper used in the bag. If you (like I) sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags, I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea. And, I more strongly recommend their Special Blend as a hardy and rich breakfast tea. …",33 out of 33 users found this review helpful

A concern to me in Arizona, where even in winter the UPS trucks heat up. I received mine late today, and it was quite warm--luckily it was under 100 outside, but on an 80 degree day the insidees of vehicles reach above 102 degrees. So it was somewhere under boiling. Very bad packaging. They could at least use #2 plastic. The taste is fine but the anti-oxidant effect is bound to be either a wash or negatively affected by the heat.

 It tastes awful,1,"I avoid sugar like it's the plague. At first, I used Splenda, and it was to me the best tasting sugar substitude in the market. Then I read a couple of articles about it's side effects, then I switched to Equal... again I read about it's side effects, that are as scary as killing braincells and might be linked to cause alzheimer's. I already have a bad enough memory, which has gotten worse (and I'm only 36!!) so I obviously got spooked. Then I read that Stevis is the best 'natural' no calorie sweetner out there (I wonder how long it will take for some article to come out and tell you how bad it is for you?) Anyhow, I bought PureVia, and it had an awful after taste, it was truly as if this was some chemicaly fabricated substitute rather than 'natural' I though: "" OK, maybe is the brand."" Then I bought, Truvia, same thing, that after taste again. Finally I bought Sun Cryslals -- which is not quite sugar free, each packet has 2g of sugar-- I figure, ""they know how bad this thing tastes that is why they are mixing it with actual sugar."" It's just as bad. I'm sorry to say, but I rather have the Splenda and Equal anyday rather than this product. I tried to be positive about it and give it a little while to get used to, but I just can't, and I can't help but to think that somewhere along the line some study is going to claim that it will make you bald, so I rather not sacrifice.

 be aware: they downgraded when they changed packaging :(,2,"Sadly, this is no longer the super-premium jerky that it used to be. Granted, if you're used to grocery-store jerky, then this is still a much better product. But if you've acclimated to chemical-free jerky, then the ""smoke flavoring"" that they've recently started adding tastes like, well, smoke flavoring, and not the real thing. You may not notice a difference. Apparently jerky is one of those things where you notice a down-shift in flavor, even when you wouldn't notice an up-shift in flavor. (Like margarine eaters think butter tastes fine, and powdered milk drinkers think cartoned milk tastes fine, but when people do the opposite, they find the tastes terrible. Jerky is the same--if you upgrade from convenience store jerky to premium you might not notice it, but when you downgrade from ""the real thing"" to anything else, it tastes distinctly artificial.) I used to buy this in bulk every few months (with a discount per Superstore Subscribe & Save), but the change in flavor made me double-check the ingredients list, and I found that the new ""smoke flavoring"" was added when they changed packaging. So this jerky is good, but not worth the premium any more. If anyone has a suggestion for an all-natural replacement without ingredients like ""smoke flavoring"" I'd appreciate it, since I'm now searching for something new. …",17 out of 19 users found this review helpful

My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag. She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken. It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, salmon, comes from salmon being the first ingredient on the ingredient list. The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy or stinky. Also, we've found that my sister's cat goes nuts for these Zuke's in the salmon flavor. They're not intended for cats, but my sister's cat apparently didn't read the package when she found and inhaled these. These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again. …",14 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 A feel good drinking experience.,5,"I'm not a health nut by any means, yet I have often enjoyed a nice hot cup of green tea when I'm at my favorite sushi bar. However, when I'd tried my hand at making green tea with packets, I could never come close to replicating the flavor and texture of the tea that I'd grown accustomed to at said sushi bar. I'd even tried the $3 cup of green tea at Starbucks and it was a bitter experience for me. On a whim I decided to search out a better green tea experience and I found this gem here on Superstore. The tin that the tea comes in was sealed securely. Upon opening the tin, inside there was a sealed bag that I opened and poured into the tin carefully. The arouma of the tea before brewing is pleasant to say the least - it has a fresh and mild scent that is not overbearing. Brewing the tea was as simple as adding a small amount (about half a teaspoon) to a cup of warm to hot water. I would not recommend boiling water as I did try that once and the tea clumped up at the bottom of the cup. This green tea looks and tastes wonderful. I don't like adding sugar or sweeteners to my tea so it was an all natural taste. It's got a smooth flavor and is not at all bitter like many other brands I've tried. It tastes just as good as the green tea from the sushi bar and I'm more than pleased with it. As a side note, I notice that some reviews recommend using ceremonial tools to enhance the experience. I may try those tools in the future, but for now I am happy with the results of my rudimentary method for brewing. One tip - remember that less is sometimes more. This small tin can last awhile if you ration the amount of tea you use per serving. Use too much and you may experience clumping at the bottom. Happy drinking! …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Best Homeopathic Dog Food Out There!,5,"I had to write a review for this wonderful brand of dog food when I saw that no one gave it the credit it so richly deserves. Natures Variety Instinct is completely grain free and made from 95% meat and 5% assorted oils (like olive oil and fish oil), vegetables, fruits, and vitamins/minerals. I was a loyal follower of Canadie dog food for years until they decided to change their formula and increase their amounts of grains being used. Then the reports came in stating that so many dogs were getting sick over it. I was at a loss until I came across this line of dog food from a small manufacturing group. The reviews I read online were phenomenal and I decided to try it. I have a baby long-haired Chihuahua that absolutely loves this food. It doesnt give her an upset stomach, nor does it make her stools runny. She only has to eat a very small amount because its so nutrient packed. Her coat looks lustrous and her eyes sparkle. I decided to use the chicken meal formula because it offered a higher protein intake compared to the other instinct dry food options., but all of them offer the same fat intake and omega-3&6.

 A nice tool to add to ones go-to drinking set,5,"I had my skepticism, I start with that because if you like what you already drink what could an aerator do to it? Well it does enough for me to keep this little tool out and nearby my good alcohol. I did the old side-by-side non aerated to aerated single shot taste test. For the really cheap clear alcohol all I can say it does is make it have less of a burn while drinking and actually smooths out the after taste to a nice fade off. As for higher end, scotch in my case, I tried a 12 year single malt & a 17 year old single malt. Starting with the 17 year old scotch, this stuff is smooth and great to begin with, the side-by-side test concluded with the aerated scotch being much more floral/aromatic, the after taste was MUCH more enjoyable as it seemed to melt into a buttery feeling and just faded off into bliss. The 12 year old scotch, it's good on the rocks and a splash of water. With the aerator it turned a 12 year old scotch into a very close 15/16 year old scotch. All the little notes of flavor came to live, I won't way it is perfect but a cheaper bottle of scotch in my cabinet just payed for this little aerator. All the harshness and lingering after taste of the 12 year old scotch, just melted away. Again not on the same level as the 17 year old but pretty darn close. I can put the max of 2 full jiggers, or more :), and know that what comes out will be a nice drink all around. For the $$, I'd suggest you give this a shot (or 2) if you like to enjoy a fine liquor. I know I will defiantly be keeping this at close hand when making my drink, or drinks for others. I'm very tempted to by a few for some good friends and family to spread the enjoyment. The stopper and release button are NOT mechanical! An ingenious and fool proof design of two opposing magnets creates the opening effect while the weight of the magnet closed the stopper. Truly is machine washable and pretty durable. …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 WORMS IN GREENIES?????,1,This is my second box of greenies that I have been quite pleased up until today. I pull out on greenie and found a WORM along with larvae!! This is horrible. I had this box for 3 months. I emptied the box and found about a dozen more worms and was disgusted. I couldn't believe greenies product was contaminating my dogs. The expiration date is dated 2013 so this clearly shows that there is something wrong with this product. I hope someone from the greenies department will give contact me to fix this. I will be posting these comments on every doggy treat review forum/website until I hear from someone so I know that they are trying to fix it and shows how much they value their customers and product.

" Seemed worth a try at first, but, with use, it's really hateful.",3,"Just got my first bottle. Delivery unproblematic: fulfilled by ""Superstore LLC.""; seems of good quality; came very fast. Like Barlean's flax oil, it comes in a non-trasparent-black, squeezable, very soft plastic bottle with a valve in the spout. The bottle is sealed under the cap: you gotta unscrew the cap and peel off the seal before you can use it. Press date is in September, which is a bit old, but otoh, hemp oil isn't as perishable as flax oil, so maybe it's OK. Since I've just learned of the purported health benefits of this oil, I can only comment on the taste of it: on the bottle, and here, and elsewhere online, hempseed oil is said to have a really nice, ""nutty"" flavour. Well, not true: actually, it's more medicinal/grassy, reminiscent of rosemary. Not unpleasant, but nothing special -- actually, flax is marginally better (though I don't particularly like it either). I suspect that were it not for their purported healthfulness, no one would use either of these oils. But supposedly they're good, so we'll see. Unlike flax oil (which has some solids floating in it and needs to be shaken up before use), hemp oil has a homogeneous consistency -- like any other cooking oil, except for the colour: a sort of of luminous green, believe it or not; quite a bit like antifreeze. So these are my initial impressions; I'll update this review if I discover anything noteworthy as I use it. 12/28/10: I have to bring the stars down: the taste is horrible; in a matter of days I've grown to hate it -- it's like a greasy medicine of some sort, an emetic. There's _nothing_ it's good with, it SPOILS the taste of anything you add it to. Why do health foods taste so bad? Are they really healthful or it's just hype 'cause the maker wants to sell it? I really can't recommend this product (though it was delivered fine, and in good packaging, so the manufacturing part is fine; just the oil itself is horrible). Flax oil is far less disgusting. 01/08/2011: Just poured the remaining half-bottle down the toilet. A solemn moment of personal liberation.

 Cool stuff! Pretty presentation,5,"This was a cool basket of goodies. I wasn't sure what to expect honestly. There were two little packets of specialty flavor coffee, two different kinds of cheese sticks & cheese biscuits, a packet of cheese & spice dip, a box of spaghetti, chocolates, box of garlic crackers, and a can of cheese stuffed olives from Spain. Most everything seemed to be from Italy or Spain. The basket is a standard little woven job with cute leather handles. (It'll make a fine container for the trick or treat candies) The chocolate covered cherries were very rich and indulgent. The hazelnut mousse chocolates were extremely rich, everyone agreed though that the cherries were the best of the two items. The cheese straws were cheesy and not overly crunchy - tasted fresh. My father is an olive nut - he can tell the difference in types of olives under all circumstances and there is always some type of olive on his table. The can of cheese stuffed olives was good - he liked them, I find olives a tad salty normally, but these were quite nice. We haven't had a chance to make the coffee yet or cook the pasta, but if the other items are any indication, there won't be anything yucky in this basket.

" Sweet, healthy and just the right amount of tangy aftertaste",4,"Sun Maid makes their Mediterranean Apricots to perfection. Tangy yet sweet, these dried apricots provide a rather healthy snack. As Superstore correctly notes, just 1.5 ounces of these beauties makes for a serving of fruit; and fruit is a critical component for a healthy diet. The canister is indeed recloseable and although they need no refrigeration you can certainly keep these in the fridge within their canister. Besides eating them straight out of the container, these apricots help to make a good fruit salad and they fit the bill for any recipe that requires apricots. The plusses don't end there. These apricots have no fat and no cholesterol; the amount of sodium they contain per serving is so low--15mg--that they have almost no salt. They provide potassium and dietary fiber as well. Each serving has only 100 calories so they are useful for persons who watch their weight. Unfortunately, however, these dried apricots don't provide any meaningful amount of vitamins. Although Superstore states that they provide antioxidants, I see very little evidence of that on the nutrition label. Yes, a single serving has 10% of the daily recommended amount of vitamin A; but that's it in the antioxidants department--unless you choose to count the 2% of vitamin C that they offer. I have to take off one star for the discrepancy regarding antioxidants; that will make this a four star review. Overall, these Mediterranean Apricots by Sun Maid offer an excellent alternative to junk foods and candy. They make a healthy snack food and they are useful for recipes as well. ENJOY!!! …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 The best Olive oil,5,"I have been using canola, sunflower and peanut oil my entire life. But after reading about the health benefits of Extra virgin olive oil or EVOO (anti cancer, anti inflammatory,good for digestive system, bones etc ) I decided to change to EVOO. And according to the UC davis study, this brand was one of the 5 imported oils that was actually 100% EVOO and not a mixture of different kinds of olive oil. and unbelievably, this is even better than whole foods brand EVOO. And the best part is this is the cheapest of the 5 that passed this test. And I would recommend you to buy this at costco, where you can buy 1.5L for $8.99.

 Fun for all ages!!!,3,"The reviews of this extraordinary product pretty much cover the bases. Tasty? Check. Full of fiber? Check. Causes extreme gut pain? Check. Causes nonstop farting like you were born in New Jersey? HELL YEAH. What can I add to this? Well, a few months back my coworkers and I drew up a contract for a spirited competition. The contestants were to eat three bars back to back with plenty of fluid at breakfast. The winner would be determined by the last person to use the bathroom. Unfortunately during a test run where I consumed three bars in one sitting, I discovered that even tapping out and running at a full sprint to the bathroom was too much of a risk - especially at work! Thank GOD I was wearing my Ex Officio Give-N-Go Briefs! That at least contained the rush that I experienced. We devised a different sport to compete in. Eat one bar and then 30 minutes later go to the gym and use the elliptical machine. You win in one of two ways: 1. Hold out and do not pass gas at all during a 20 minute workout. However you can also win by passing enough gas to drive your competitors off of their machines. So even if you tap out early you can still win. It is critical to use the elliptical during this challenge due to the rapid cheek movement it causes. I gotta stop eating these things. No one wants to sit near me anymore. …",38 out of 55 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 The Sweet Stuff,3,"In so many ways, this is a really good jerky: low in fat from the buffalo, a nicely thick natural slab cut, slightly moist so that it has a nice bite without the toughness of leather, and a sufficiently peppery kick from a nice black pepper crust. Plus the assurance of no hormones, preservatives, or msg as shouted on the big green sticker on the package. The quality is there, no doubt. So what's wrong with it? It's right there, second on the list of ingredients -- SUGAR! This jerky is too sweet! I ordered the Peppered flavor and I was expecting a savory treat, a nice snack for the afternoons.

 Delicious spread that has the power to transform most sandwiches into a real gourmet treat,5,"Skillet is the name a popular Seattle area food truck owned and operated by Culinary Institute of America trained chef, Joshua Henderson. After working at a variety of top restaurants (including a stint as Head Chef at Beverly Hill's Avalon), Josh moved back to Seattle, bought a 1962 Airstream trailer and now serves gourmet food out of it to Seattle's night-time crowd. Skillet's signature item is simply called ""The Burger"" and what really sets it apart from other deluxe, $12 hamburgers is a generous slathering of Henderson's own creation, Bacon Jam. When I first encountered this product I was so blown away by it's heavenly, bacon-rich flavor that I rushed to my computer to find out how it is made. This is from Skillet's website: ""... we take a big bunch of really, really good bacon, and render it down...add a bunch of spices..onions, etc. and let it simmer for about 6 hours...give it a quick puree, blast chill it...and you have bacon jam..."" This stuff is great! It has a thick, spreadable consistency with hints of powdered chilies, brown sugar and vinegar. It gives a somewhat subtle but unmistakable bacon taste to whatever you spread it on. Hamburgers are a natural, but I have used it on paninis, grilled cheese sandwiches and a baked potato. This will be a regular item in my house. I should be able to use Bacon Jam for things other than sandwiches and I look forward to experimenting with this wonderful spread. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Not worth the money,1,"I ordered this item because it was described as a quality gift basket that you could ""share"" with friends and family. And the reviews I read were outstanding. However, when I got the basket it was extremely small. It was smaller than my toddler's Easter basket! The food packages were so tiny that they could not be enjoyed by more than one person. Most of the basket was paper filler. The basket itself was slightly warped (not too badly) and the bow was made of cheap paper and was much smaller than that in the photo. I can't imagine how they justify charging this much money for something so small . . . not to mention the shipping! I was very disappointed.

" Yummy, weird, salty, and high in fat... but I like them!",3,"I would give these 3 and 1/2 stars if I could. Now that I have tried these I see why there are so many ""mixed"" reviews. To start: they are NOT ""healthy"". Yes, they are low in carbs, but for the total calories from fat (60 out of 75) - the percentage is WAY too high. That means the calories are 80% from fat. Yes, I realize they are made of cheese, which is mostly fat, but they are not something I want to be eating all day every day. (Kind of like the 100-calorie pack treats that are portion controlled, but not so ""healthy"" either.) Plus, they are high in sodium like most other people have pointed out. However, they are very low in carbs (1 gram) and high in protein (5 grams). I got the ""Classic White Cheddar Cheese"". Keep in mind that white cheddar is one of my all-time favorite cheeses. The texture is crunchy - similar to a rice cake (a little denser). The one thing that I strongly DON'T like, is the weird, greasy, oily feeling it leaves on my teeth. But maybe that is just me. But the flavor is fine. The packaging states the following: 1 bag (0.5 oz.) - 14 grams: Calories: 75 Calories from fat: 60 Total fat - 6.5g (10% Daily Value [DV]) Cholesterol - 25mg (8% DV) Sodium - 275mg (12% DV) Total carbs - 1g (0% DV) Protein - 5 g Vitamin A - 5% DV Calcium - 16% DV The size of the bag reminds me of those little pouches of fruit gummies that they make for kids lunches.

In fact it was so bad, that I had to rinse my mouth thoroughly after taking one sip :( I'm not asking Superstore for a refund, since the product was delivered as advertized and the expiration date is 6 months from now.

 Banana bread brownie?,5,"Wow, I just had my first Larabar today after a long run, and I have been blown away. As of late my preference has been for protein bars, but I had picked up a Larabar a few months ago just because it looked interesting. I tried the ""banana cookie dough"" flavor, since I'm a banana nut. Unwrapping the package was difficult, though I've since found out that they have a multi-layer wrapper because there are no preservatives. Once open, I was confronted with a raw looking rectangle of brown with pale chunks in it. It looked moist and smelled phenomenal. The first bite made me think ""banana bread"", and as I ate the rest of the bar I decided it wasn't quite like banana bread, but closer to that than a ""cookie"", in any case. The pale chunks were the #1 ingredient - almonds. The #2 and #3 ingredients were dates and bananas, respectively. The #4 ingredient was.... nothing. There are only 3 ingredients. I actually flipped the wrapper over to see the continuation of the ingredients list before I realized that there was no more list! These bars are a little expensive for a non-protein energy bar, but the taste is like nothing you would expect from a brown rectangular smashed together food thing.

 Very good tea,5,"This is a great tea. I highly recommend all Davidson's teas and I am really glad I discovered them for myself and my family- chamomile, rooibos, hibiscus, green teas- the price is great and you get the organic tea of high quality & quantity. Rooibos tea, like green and black tea, has been found to be rich in anti-oxidants and flavonoids. In fact, Rooibos tea has been found to have as much as 50 times more SOD than Green Tea. It also has other anti-oxidants not found in other teas. The effect of free radicals (a by-product of normal cell function) in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the anti-oxidants in Rooibos tea. Rooibos tea is completely pure and natural, as it contains no additives, preservatives or colorants. It is a soothing drink for people on a calorie-restricted diet, without adding kilojoules. Rooibos tea is also strongly recommended for people suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension. Rooibos tea contains no caffeine and therefore has a soothing effect on the central nervous system. Rooibos tea is also low in tannin and therefore does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body. Rooibos tea has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants. Rooibos tea also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, heartburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. Furthermore, rooibos tea also supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and especially fluoride, needed for the development of strong teeth and bones. It contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid, which promotes healthy skin and magnesium which is necessary for a healthy nervous system. Rooibos tea has a soothing effect on the skin, relieving itching and certain skin irritations like eczema, nappy rash and acne when directly applied to the affected area. …",54 out of 58 users found this review helpful

 Try these first ...,5,"If you are considering purchasing the David's Signature Jelly Beans, this is a great place to start. This contains 16 different flavors, from bacon (not my favorite) to a lemon so sweet and natural you would think you were on the porch drinking lemonade with your Grandma and Grandpa. David was the original inventor of Jelly Bellies, and when he finally re-entered the competition he worked hard to come up with something even better. In my book, he has done that. While these are pricy, they ARE very true to flavor, and have no artificial flavorings or colorings. Where the jelly belly won our hearts with their intensity, these will win out with their true-to-life flavor. It is as though the originals were made for children, these were made for adults. I understand that these are being introduced into some of the upscale candy stores soon, but for now, the only place near me where I can buy them is, well, Superstore. Here is a rundown of my opinion of the different flavors First Row: Bacon: Too much like a slab of bacon for my taste. Save these for the guys to prove how tough they are. Black cherry: These are NOT cherry, they are black cherry, and rest nicely on the tongue. Mmmmm. Good. Blueberry: These are more the taste of blueberry muffins than blueberries off the vine, at least in my opinion. So I guess I better leave them out of my recipes using real blueberries. If you are a blueberry fan, these will tickle your palate. Coconut: So real tasting I'm surprised you don't have to pound them against a rock to get into them. :-) Actually, I like the way these have a fruity aftertaste. Second Row: Cranberry: I have made my own sauce from fresh, and these don't carry quite as much taste. But for a Jelly Bean, they have a tart cranberry flavor. Definitely a winner. Ginger: These are so real I may have to grate these into the next recipe I have that calls for Ginger. In fact, I may save these and use them as decorations on my home made Gingerbread Men. That is if I don't scarf all of them down ... Ooops too late. Maybe I can buy the pound pack next time. Grape: Are you a fan of grape Koolaid? That's exactly what these remind me of, except my Mom always skimped on the sugar, and the super sweet flavor of these makes one Jelly bean taste as good as a full cup of that powdered stuff. I found myself sticking out my tongue to see if it turned purple! Green Apple: This has a strong ""sour apple"" flavor, which mellows to sweet as you eat it. Not apple pie, something cleaner. I tried it with the Cranberry and loved the two together. Third Row Himalayan Sea Salt: Ummm, these are salty. And sweet. I'm still trying to decide if I like them plain. I really like them with my Godiva Chocolates, but that might be cheating. You will have to make up your own mind on these. Lemon: Fresh squeezed lemonade ... slightly tart, nicely sweet. Clean tasting. If I could make my lemonade this perfect, I'd be in heaven. Sadly, I no longer live in the citrus belt, so I have to visit family in California to get the fresh stuff. They hit the mark with this flavor. Orange Punch: It is oranges, but I would guess it might have a bit of tangerine mixed in. If you have ever eaten home style candied orange peel, you will recognize this flavor. I think they might have called it orange punch since it doesn't taste like a fresh orange. Like some of the other flavors, it gets more sweet as you eat it. Peach: I have my own Sweet Georgia Peach tree, and these are not as good as a home picked peach ripe and warm from the sun with the juice running down my chin. However, they are peachier than most things I have tried that are peach flavored, and will make do when I can't eat mine fresh. More of a peach smoothie flavor ... but I'm pretty picky about peaches. The best part about these is you don't have to peel them to enjoy them. Fourth Row Pomegranate: After my first bite, I was sure it was real fruit and checked for seeds. Nope, just a jelly bean. This is another right-on flavor. Root Beer: Another area where I am picky ... I had to decide, is it A&W or Mugg? Actually, when I was young and had a job at A&W I used to draw frosty mugs there. This tastes a lot like the fresh drawn A&W with a nice head on top. Strawberry: I'm surprised they included this because it is such an overused flavor. So I sat back and rested, concentrating on the flavor, hearing only the flavor (oops, that's my meditation tape, sorry). These have more of a fresh strawberry taste, just like the ones you would cut to put on top of your angel food cake. In fact, if they had a whipped cream variety, I'm sure they would taste nice together. Not as stong as the Pomegranate, but a nice taste all of their own. Vanilla Bean: Have you ever tasted Vanilla flavoring? Yuch, it tastes nothing like the flavor you are expecting from the aroma. This tastes like what Vanilla Flavoring should taste like. As it got sweeter, I started hearing the cranking of the ice cream maker, and realized that it reminded me of the vanilla ice cream my grandma used to make. Loads of different flavors. These come in a nice box and would make an excellent gift for someone who enjoys the very best. If you are looking for an unusual gift for the man in your life, you might want to consider the Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Man Mix which includes some wilder flavors along with some of these. They even package the Habanero separately to keep the men safe ... I am grateful to have received this sampler in order to try these out, and am happy to post my opinion of them in a review. These are, indeed, beyond gourmet. (Ends review and sneaks off to eat the rest of these wonderful Jelly Beans). …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" Fantastic chocolate taste, filling protein bar!",5,"Let me start by saying that I have a monstrous sweet tooth. I'm pretty sure I've tried every protein bar out there, and this is the best one I've had by far. This bar is filling, but most protein bars are filling. What Think Thin Chocolate Fudge accomplishes is truly remarkable. The chocolate actually tastes like chocolate and not some contrived chocolate-imposter. The texture is chewy and smooth at the same time. When I eat these, I don't just feel like I'm ""making do"", when really, I'd rather have a cookie. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.,5,"UPDATE: The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great. Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution: I have been buying the ""Organic Liver for Dogs"" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Superstore. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product. I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Superstore are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets. As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem. Unfortunately, Superstore doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally). UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me. I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars. I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well. I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars. Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Proflowers No Friend to Women,1,"ProFlowers advertises on Rush Limbaugh's radio show. Rush Limbaugh who has been married 4 times, has no children or family, called a Georgetown law student (who was invited to a US House committee meeting) a **** and a prostitute for using birth control. Rush has no business commenting on family's, or women, as he has no real experience with either. ProFlowers should not support this kind of hateful, crude and slanderous attack on women. Do not buy flowers from ProFlowers, if your daughter is on birth control, Both Rush and Proflowers believe she a tramp. Shame on Proflowers for not pulling their ads on Rush's talk show. Try another flower company. Support women and do not buy ProFlowers …",13 out of 53 users found this review helpful
 WARNING! TASTE BURNOUT LIKELY,5,I had not had a slim jim in 3 years. I brought these to quench my childhood thirst for this snack. I ate all 100 of them in about 18 days.

" Trip #10 to the toilet after one bar, WATCH OUT!",1,"A co-worker left these in the breakroom. I ate one up, boy was it delicious. Within 90 minutes I had to go to the bathroom, it has continued all day. Gastric Distress to the max! I read the wrapper, it has 9 grams of fiber. If you are not a large consumer of fiber in your diet, I say eat 1/3 of a bar and stop. See what happens. Due to the unexpected results I had to give this a one star. No wonder the bars were up for grabs in the breakroom! I wonder who else in the office is suffering. …",7 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" Really wanted to like this, but sadly disappointed.",2,"I have a regular monthly subscription to another brand of summer sausage available on Superstore. It's very popular with friends and family for snacking, and when the regular brand wasn't available, I purchased this one for a temporary replacement. I read through the reviews and felt this would do the trick until the regular stuff was available again. Unfortunately, the only thing the two seem to have in common is general shape and color. While the flavor isn't unpleasant, the texture leaves a lot to be desired. It's both fibrous and greasy, with globs/pockets of fat and strings of what I can only imagine to be muscle or gristle of some kind. They're like white threads, and the mouthfeel of the sliced product is very unappetizing. In reading through the reviews again, I saw one where the reviewer mentioned this summer sausage had potential when heated/cooked, so I sliced it thinly and tried both panfrying and microwaving it. This does improve the texture and allows the extra fat to render out (if you're microwaving, be sure to sit the pieces on top of paper towels, and don't let it go too long without checking ... LOTS of fat drains out of the meat!). After it's been heated/cooked, the product can be enjoyed for its flavor without the unpleasant texture. If our regular choice becomes unavailable again at some point, we'll just do without or look for something in a local grocery store. We won't be purchasing this product again. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
