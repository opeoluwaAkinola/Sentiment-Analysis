 BEST COFFEE IVE EVER HAD,5,I bought the coffee originally because i liked the idea of an organic coffee that was french roasted. i like a strong cup of coffee and this coffee provides that as well as one of the best aromas and tastes of any cup of coffee ive ever had. I use this coffee with an inexpensive grinder and a nice percolator. This coffee is absolutely worth the price. …,27 out of 29 users found this review helpful
 Wonderful to blend into power shakes or hot drinks,5,"I love this product. I add it to protein/whey/yogurt shakes, and to give a more chocolatey kick to hot chocolate. I take only half of the cheap hot chocolate mix and add a spoonful of this chocolate. The resulting hot chocolate is much richer and not nearly so sweet. I also use it with Acai powder (Sambazon or Superstore Thunder) and add one or two drops of stevia. Acai/Chocolate blend is really the best for mental energy, not just physical energy; It helps me focus for studying, writing, or problem-solving. This powder is a bit coarse, so it works better in cold drinks if shaken or blended, and in hot drinks you need to stir a few more times than usual. This a good price in a two-pack. …",23 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 The facts about Agave,5,"We all know that too much sugar, or fructose, is bad for you. And that includes agave, which is concentrated fructose. However, I like the taste of agave, especially as compared to other sugar substitutes, and I can use less of it than sugar (see below). It has a lower glycemic index (meaning the body metabolizes it slower reducing the risk of an insulin spike), and it is natural rather than chemically engineered like high fructose corn syrup. The key to all sugars is moderation. Unfortunately, almost all baked or processed foods that we buy are loaded with sugars, especially high fructose corn syrup. At least by baking my own foods I can have more control over my family's sugar consumption and I am happy to have found agave so that when I do occasionally bake sweets, at least I can use less of it. Raw organic blue agave is not chemically processed as some have indicated. It is the pure juice from the blue agave plant. The juice is extracted by stripping the leaves of the plant, then chopping up the bulbous base of the plant which is heated to no more than 118° to get the juice flowing. The actual extraction is accomplished through centrifugal force and the juice obtained is then bottled. (I should mention there are other processes that can be used which would entail heating to a higher temperature, but which still results in juice without additives--although any natural enzymes would be killed at higher heat.) Blue agave has a glycemic index of 11 as compared to sugar which is 68-85. Calories are the same as sugar but it takes half as much to three quarters as much agave to be as sweet as sugar, meaning less calories for the same sweetness. Compare this process to how High Fructose Corn Syrup is made. Corn kernels are soaked in warm water along with sulfur dioxide (a toxic gas). This makes it easier to separate the starch, hull, protein and oil components. The kernals are then milled wet to remove the oil. The remaining corn starch is washed. Next, three types of genetically-engineered enzymes are added to the resulting starch and water mixture. This breaks down the starch into glucose and fructose to create the desired balance of the two. The final step is an evaporation process to obtain the desired consistency. So, you decide. Agave, (which does retain some minerals and nutrients found in the agave plant), highly refined table sugar with no nutrients, chemically engineered high fructose corn syrup, chemical sugar substitutes, which may have side effects or health risks, or other sweeteners such as Stevia, which is natural but leaves a bitter aftertaste? …",43 out of 46 users found this review helpful
 This stuff is absolutely NASTY!!,1,"I have no idea who is submitting the 5* reviews here, but they lost their taste buds years ago. This stuff tastes nothing like salt. It has a horrible bitter after-taste that lingers in your mouth ruining anything it touches. Try it at a restaurant or something before buying it. It even nauseates in cooking or in recipes requiring any significant amount of salt. If you are on a salt free diet, find something else. Yuk! With a capital Yuk!! =============UPDATE===================== I have found one use for this. In cooking, with tomato sauce, if you mix it with real salt, you need much less salt. The tomato sauce appears to nullify the bitterness somehow. So, if you like pasta with sauce but have to cut down on salt intake, perhaps this is the answer for that. But it is NO salt shaker for the table. …",8 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 100% kill rate,5,"I had struggled with gas bombs, flooding & metal traps. These work....in time. I'm far too impatient & frustated by seeing my yard destroyed while gophers out smart the above methods. The Victor black box has been great! I have a 100% kill rate for the last 2 weeks and generally get my gopher within 4 hrs of placing the trap. Also, you can see if the trap has been tripped without disturbing the trap. Unlike the metal jaw style trap, where I had to trip it when pulling it out of the hole (because most of the time I had nothing.) I put a little bit of carrot in the bait hole in the back of the box & so far, I'm very happy. This trap appears more humane in terms of a rapid kill (snaps the spine) & it less messy as the gopher doesn't have any wounds to deal with. It's worth the money. There is no way you are going to lose this thing underground either. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Made in China....if that matters to you,4,"I have made every effort to NOT buy/feed anything made in China to my pet. I researched these duck/sweet potato treats before finally deciding to buy them. Nowhere on the Superstore product page does it tell you where these treats are made, so I searched for the Smokehouse website which claimed that ONLY some of their CHICKEN treats contained chicken from China, but all other products are made in the USA. So, I felt safe in purchasing these duck/sweet potato treats. After opening a bag, and giving them to my dog did I glance at the product origin. Needless to say my dog likes them very much, but I was NOT happy to find PRODUCT OF CHINA on the bag. Boo hiss to Superstore for not putting the product origin on the product page, and to Smokehouse for misleading consumers on their product information website. Why do they do this, because there are customers just like me that care where the product originates. Many of you may not be concerned about this, but I am, and I think it's very misleading not to provide accurate, and complete information about the product when purchasing from an internet store. At least the product doesn't smell like plastic like the Dingo products. I won't be purchasing these again. My dog seemed to like them, but she won't be getting anymore of them. I took a star off due to the lack of complete information from Superstore, and misleading information from Smokehouse. UPDATE: Big thumbs up to Superstore for great customer service. When I called to return this item they were very helpful in processing a refund, and because it is considered a grocery item I didn't even have to return the items. I had also purchased the Smokehouse duck chips, but they too are made in China. I suggested the addition of the country of origin to both product pages. Just another reason why I don't hesitate to purchase from Superstore. They truly have great customer service....rare these days. …",83 out of 83 users found this review helpful

" Not exactly like traditional potato chips, but a great substitute",5,"One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips. I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips. In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip. This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind. I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco. I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area. Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any. I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Superstore in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me. They are definitely worth the money. I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips. The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips. I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do. Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them. As for the portion size, it's pretty generous. For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors. I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next. …",73 out of 77 users found this review helpful

 Sorry to give these up -- afraid of cancer recurrence,3,"The flavor of these bars is very, very good. They are filling and have many good nutritive qualities. That being said, we have to stop buying these bars. They are using soy protein isolate, which probably met two of the manufacturer's goals: 1) Vegetarian/non dairy 2) Save money -- that is one cheap-o source of protein Although we all know that an alternative -- WHEY protein from cross-microfiltration -- is the highest form of protein available right now, it is expensive. It is more easily assimilated than soy, causes fewer GI issues (gas, indigestion, etc.), and has a better amino acid profile, etc., plus has little to no lactose remaining. ""Instead of using destructive chemicals, cross-flow microfiltration uses filters to separate protein from undesirable fat, cholesterol and lactose, based on molecular size and shape.(18) The low-temperature process isolates the native protein of whey at its biologically natural pH, carefully preserving its biological activity. GMPs and other immune-boosting components remain intact."" informational reference: www &lt;dot> sportswhey &lt;dot> com/science_ion_exchange.htm Aside from the problem we have with the grossly inferior form of protein they are using, our main reason for stopping with this product is this: >>>>> We don't want our cancer to return. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; We have had breast cancer, and it was estrogen positive. Our oncologist has indicated that while foods containing soy are ok in reasonable amounts, SOY ISOLATES ARE NOT SAFE FOR THESE TYPES OF CANCERS. Research backs this up. These bars are possibly cancer-promoting in the sense that they have estrogenic-effects. Women who are at risk for breast cancer (and who knows how much of the population this includes -- we don't know until after we have gotten it most of the time) SHOULD NOT BE EATING THESE BARS. Maybe they can put a warning label on them to say women should check with their doctors before consuming them. The research on this is readily available on the Internet, and my oncologist has studied this issue extensively. We are sad to give these bars up because they were our favorite in terms of flavor. …",5 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Harleys MaMade,5,"I have used MaMade as the basis for my home made Marmalade ever since I discovered it in the UK years ago. Thick cut (my preference)is harder to find than the thin cut. The way I use MaMade eliminates the difference anyway. I buy 2 large Navel Oranges, 4 large Lemons, and 1 Pink Grapefruit. I then use a paring knife to remove the outer skin of this fresh fruit and chop it all into small pieces. I then extract all the juice I can from this fruit and usually it is more than the 425ml called for in the MaMade recipe. I then boil the skin pieces in the about 500ml of combined juice to soften them up then add sugar to raise the boiling temperature to speed up the cooking process. After about 30 minutes of boiling I add the Mamade and rest of the 4lb of sugar. Because there is too much liquid in the mix to allow the marmalade to set without hours of boiling I add Pectin to the mix. MaMade already has Pectin in its ingredients but not enough if one adds more than 425ml of water. The added juice and pieces makes this the best marmalade you have ever tasted, plus you get more than 6lb of marmalade promised on the can. …",24 out of 25 users found this review helpful
 As expected,4,"I'm a novice when it comes to Bonsai. I have purchased an elm and juniper and both arrived well packaged and healthy. Actually, the packaging was a little tough because they were tightly wrapped with some kind of plastic wrap. And although I'm not an expert it's hard for me to testify that the juniper is actually 4 years old. To my amateur eyes it looks to be much younger. The elm has lost a few leaves yellowing and falling but after a few Internet searches I learned why this is happening. The pots were as I expected and I believe them to be of nice quality. The box also had a green bottle of fertilizer which I wasn't expecting but it was nice and I appreciate it. I think it would have been better if the seller would have included a complementary brochure for Bonsai related products such as humidity trays. The reason I say this is because I am a novice and upon initially ordering I had no clue that such things were needed to help Bonsai thrive. At least with a complementary brochure I could have looked through it and say ""Hmm, what is a humidity tray for?"" and would have gotten around to getting a few sooner. I have had both Bonsai for almost two weeks and neither appear to be dying or on the fringes of dying. And considering this is Winter it's supposed to be the dormant season so I don't expect much activity until Spring. I would buy again from this seller. …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 Not for my doggie,2,"Before I get into my commentary about the Orijen 6 Fish, I have to say that I have fed my dogs and cats raw for many years. We bought a 9 week old Pekingese recently from a breeder. She provided us with a 2-3 week supply of the food. I went ahead and fed it because I didn't want to change it too fast. His stools were big, soft and stinky. I found a shop that was selling it here and went out there. By coincidence they were going to have an Orijen rep there. So I talked with the rep who said that a puppy shouldn't be eating the 6 Fish and he recommended a puppy mix. I bought it and took it home. Basically I had the same results. I switched him to raw. I think he has a bit of a nervous stomach as he has a few problems but nothing like with the Orijen. I have read a lot of 5 Star reviews from people who seem to be conscientious and observant.

In fact, I usually like health foods that others find disgusting. However, this product has a ridiculously grainy texture and little flavor. More importantly, it's not remotely healthy! It is made primarily with wheat gluten, which is not exactly a health product and has little nutritional value. The amount of controversial food colorings, preservatives and corn syrup in this product are also disgusting. I used to be a strict vegan (for three years) and a vegetarian (for 13 years), but I've come to realize that eating products like natural, organic turkey dogs are a much better choice than eating wheat gluten and soy protein concentrate products. This product is a great example of vegan not necessarily meaning healthy. I got a package of Linkettes at a big discount, and I would have been really upset if I had paid full price.

 Great Idea That Works Well Until Your Cat Outsmarts You,5,"I have two cats, one is mine and the other is my girlfriends. My cat, although he isn't thrilled with getting the occasional ""tummy pill,"" does do pretty well with them and doesn't usually throw too bad of a fit. My girlfriend's cat on the other hand, is quite the opposite. That little **** will throw one of the biggest fits you ever seen when you attempt to give him a pill. You would think that we are trying to give him a bath he throws such a fit, which is another story all together! Anyhow, we bought some of these ""pill hiding treats"" in an attempt to get him to take his medicine without the daily fight that is usually attached to the act of pill taking. The very first time we tried them we were both a bit apprehensive wondering if we had just wasted some money on treats instead of the normal band-aids which come in quite handy at pill time. Needless to say, these ""pill pockets"" worked! We were literally amazed the first time that we gave him one with a pill in it and he actually gulped it down without even tasting it. Oh, what joy swept through our household. Little did we know that it was only going to last about 2 weeks. Just enough time for use to become complacent as far as the daily pill act was concerned. Sure enough, we were once again outsmarted by the cat. Approximately two weeks into the ""pill hiding treat"" debacle, we started finding his pill on the floor but no sign of the pill pocket. We soon discovered that the little **** was chewing the pill pocket off from around the pill and eating it without eating the pill. Now we give him several ""pill hiding treats"" throughout the day, and only one of them has the pill in it, but he never knows which one it is. Although we never put it in the very first one, or the very last one. This has been working now for about a month, but I figure were running out of time on this one and had better start thinking up a new plan of attack before we are once again outsmarted by the cat.

" Fantastic Coffee, BUT...",4,"BEST INSTANT, PERIOD! BUT... I can't drink VIA made according to it's instructions. It's just way, WAY, too strong. (I'm talking seriously stronger than what you get at a local Starbucks.) Let me explain. When I make brewed coffee, I freshly grind beans to a very fine texture, using two or three tablespoons of grounds per 6 ounces of water. So I'm used to a strong cup of coffee. Since one packet of VIA makes even a large mug of water into an un-drinkablly strong brew, I use only half a packet. The problem is, a couple hours later, the left-over half becomes an unusable blob that won't come out of the packet. No great loss... I've had a GREAT cup of coffee, and I can just toss the other half packet, right? Well, acutally, that's a problem for me. I'm of the 'clean your plate / starving kids in Biafra' generation.

 NOTHING like regular pasta,1,"I agree with the other reviewer, the preparation alone with these noodles would cause me to give them fewer then five stars. However, if they tasted like regular pasta with only 40 calories a bag, I could deal. Unfortunately, they are disgusting. I am a big fan of the cookbook author/food blogger Hungry Girl, and she uses these all the time so I had to try them. Needless to say I was very disappointed. They were very chewy (she told her fans this, so I was prepared for it), smelled nauseating when I opened the bag (rotting vegetables or fish smell maybe?), and had a bizarre taste. Regular pasta just kind of works as a texture filler for dishes, but these noodles had a strong and weird, chalky flavor. I will NEVER, EVER buy them again and will just settle for eating pasta dishes made with whole wheat noodles only once in a while. If you still feel the need to try them, I'd recommend buying only one bag until you know whether or not they are for you. …",24 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 Gourmet powerful Salt & Vinegar chips!,5,"Kettle brand chips are very crunchy. I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum. Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy. If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand. Otherwise, you'll love these chips. The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY. I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time. I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically. Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor. The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy! …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" It's an average beef, potato and carrot stew. Women love it.",1,"I personally do not care for this beef stew. My mother and niece absolutely love it. I find the gravy a bit greasy. The meat is not whole pieces, but rather compressed ground hamburger. The potatoes and carrots are what you would expect from canned food. I have been stocking up on Bulk Canned food with an expiration date of at least 1.5 years from date of purchase. You would be surprised at how fast some canned food expires! Yes, the economy is collapsing under Obama and his Communist Marxist agenda. Stock up now. The current price and vendor for Dinty Moore Beef Stew is ridiculously overpriced.

 Healthy but extremely low calorie per can (be careful not to underfeed your cat),2,"When I opened the Weruva can (3oz, chicken), I immediately noticed that there is not enough solid food (chicken) in the can, and a large amount of the volume is filled up by potato starch and water (85% moisture). I looked at the label - it says: ""feed adult cats 1 oz for each pound of body weight"". So, it means that I need to give my 14 pounds cat 4 cans a day to maintain his present weight. Usually when other pet food company says that, they are exaggerating and your pet can live on half the amount they recommended. But it is not the case for Weruva, based on their website, the calorie content for the 5.5 ounce can is only 84 cal. So, by doing a simple math, the calorie content for the 3oz can is only ~46 cal. The ideal calorie intake for my 14 pounds cat is 195cal (formula: ideal weight (13 pounds) multiply by 15). In other words, I need to feed my cat four 3oz can per day. So, I need to spend $4 (3oz) per day on cat food (he lives on a non-kibble diet). That is a lot of dough!!! And I can do better by making my own cat food or switch to another non-grain cat food brand. I think this product is overpriced and cat owners need to be aware of the calorie content in Weruva's canned cat food, so that they won't underfeed their pets with insufficient amount of calorie. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful

I've tried nearly all other commercial brands of sugar-free syrup and had come to the confident conclusion that there really was no such thing as a sugar-free syrup that actually tasted anything resembling the real thing. In fact, before my package arrived, I was already contemplating how I'd get rid of it all after what I anticipated would be a definite dissapointment (yet again) in taste. I'm very pleased to say that I'll be keeping every single bottle and will probably use it all up before the expiration, hoarding it away for myself like a pirate hoards treasure. It truly is, by far and away, the best sugar-free syrup I've ever had. It tastes almost exactly like the real thing, both in texture and flavor. Another perk of sugar-free syrup: Absolutely no annoying stickiness should I ever get overzealous in my pouring! At last my search is over! I'm one very happy camper and truly satisfied customer.

 Deceptive labeling for glorified peanut bars,1,"I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description. It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond, walnut and macadamia, especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list. Maybe they think that people can't tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts? I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK, but I have a hard time believing that the 4.5 star rating the product currently receives hasn't been created by company shills. It is a shame too, since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description.

After all, I have had quite the cavity problem over the years and I figured I had to do something to save my dentist the despair that struck over his face every time I walked into his office.

I popped them in my mouth one by one, careful to roll them around with my tongue and over and back and fro between my gums, lips and tongue. I relished how soft and plyable they were and the taste was exquisite. I could not believe that I was experiencing nirvana from a sugar free product. About an hour into the movie however, things started to change and before long, it was as if the gates of he11 opened up in my room.

Sautee in butter, very slowly while cutting chicken into 1"" to 2"" cubes (small because it cooks faster). Add the chicken to the onion/garlic sautee and add 2 tsp turmeric (or to taste) and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (more or less to taste). Start cooking your rice at this time. Cook over medium heat (don't burn the garlic) until chicken is done (5 to 10 minutes). Pre-mix the Kitchens of India Butter Chicken paste in a small bowl using hot water until smooth and add the mixture to the pan. Cook down to desired consistency. Optional: add tomato paste, plain yogurt or cream cheese (separately or in any combination). Or add a fresh mango cut into small pieces for ""Mango Chicken"". This makes a truly restaurant-class Indian dish and takes just 30 - 40 minutes from concept to meal. Serve with a small salad, fresh veggies and nan for a complete meal that is a real treat!

Also great with pasta in place of a marinara or other sauce. It is a flavorful olive oil, so you might want to choose a less-flavorful oil for sauteeing when using another main sauce.

 Some of the other reviews are for a DIFFERENT flavor,5,"If you can get one at the store first, obviously try it before ordering a 16 pack. This is the plain Jocalat bar and I can say I am hooked. We gave up processed sugar and are going the organic route on everything. And this is perfect for a chocolate fix. It's great because there is no added sugar (or sugar substitute) unless you count figs. If you are addicted to the fat (butter) and sugar of the majority of candy bars, this is different. Tastes what I remember a brownie to be like except less sweet. When you get off sugar, your tastebuds change. It's worth it though. Some other people, if they are referring to this actual flavor, probably are thinking it isn't sweet enough. Did not care at all for the orange flavored one. Haven't tried the mint. Coffee/hot variety goes against what I'm doing health wise. I'm alright with pure chocolate though. I think this is as good as it gets. ------ UPDATE: Haven't eaten these in a long time.

I was debating between this and Spry gum, but a lot of reviewers said that Spry faded quickly. Glad I chose this instead.

" Very small capacity, takes too long to use, hard to clean.",2,"I won the Beaba from a blog giveaway, but I don't think I would ever spend the money to buy one. I only used mine about a dozen times before passing it on to a friend. It did everything it was advertised to do. I don't think it saves on time and effort, though. You still have to clean, peel, and cut your fruits or veggies into chunks, so no time saved there. If anything it takes MORE time to prepare baby food with the Beaba simply because it has such a small capacity. You can put about a cup to a cup and a half of chopped raw food in the steamer, which seems like a good amount of food. However, by the time you steam and puree your food, you end up with only about half a cup of baby food, maybe a bit more. Let's say you're going to make some sweet potatoes. Always a great food to start babies on because it's mild and sweet and can be pureed really smooth and creamy. The Beaba can only cook about half of an average sweet potato at a time. I can cook four LARGE sweet potatoes and puree them in my 7-cup food processor all at once. With the Beaba, start to finish, from peeling to chopping to steaming to blending to cooling, you're looking at around 30 to 45 minutes before you can feed your baby. Also, food coming out of the Beaba is EXTREMELY hot, rightly so, but you can't feed a baby food that hot so you have to let it cool, which just adds to your food prep time. Anyone who is serious about making most or all of their own baby food is going to want to make baby food in BULK. Most busy moms don't have time to waste on a product like the Beaba that makes such a small amount of food at a time. Just one hour in the kitchen on Sunday and I had enough baby food to last all week, if not longer. I have a KitchenAid 7-cup food processor which I found on sale at BB&B for around sixty bucks. I would steam my veggies and fruits on the stove or even in the microwave, then puree them quickly in the food processor, usually making about 4 cups of baby food at a time. Also, one pot, one steamer basket, and one food processor was MUCH easier to clean than the Beaba. The Beaba streamer basket was stained orange the first time I used it and I didn't care for all the little parts and pieces I needed to clean on the Beaba. Don't waste your money on fancy or expensive baby food storage containers. Gladware makes small 4-ounce containers. I believe a pack of 8 is under 3 bucks. I would fill about a dozen of these at a time with 3 or 4 different foods and pop them in the freezer. Each night before I went to bed, I would pull a couple of containers out of the freezer and stick them in the fridge for the next day. Come mealtime, it was fast and easy to scoop out what I needed and warm it up in the microwave. After several months of freezing and heating the little blue lids of the Gladware containers would crack, but they're so affordable that I didn't mind tossing some in the recycling bin and buying another set. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful

When I began taking raspberry ketones along with the green tea, Tea Extract 60 Capsules (500mg) + FREE 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder , this is when I started to actually lose weight. I read an article that said taking them together created synergistic weight loss effects, and so far I have lost six pounds in the past 17 days compared to just a couple pounds when I took the green tea on its own. There are a lot of good health benefits to be had by taking green tea on its own too but for energy and weight loss, adding raspberry ketones to the mix has been great. …",35 out of 35 users found this review helpful

 Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on,5,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups. I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive. I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products. If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :) EcoBrew VS Solofill First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew. Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker. These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable! I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product. The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly. …",559 out of 562 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Too expensive,2,"I never purchased this product. I did some research on emergency kits and one of the big questions is how to handle the water requirements. Guidelines state 1 gallon (about 4 liters) of water per day per person. It would take 6 of these cases (48 boxes of 250ml) to built a 72-hour kit for each member of the household. it would cost you A LOT of money - well over $100 with shipping - per person, for 72-hours. the only gain is the 5 year claimed shelf life. In contrast, buying simple bottled water would cost you about $1 - 2 per gallon, and has a 2 year ""best before"" date. It will probably taste better if you rotate it once a year, and will sustain life without poisoning you for much longer than 2 years. A simple trip to the grocery store and now I have 7 days of water for a family of 4 for under $40. Even if I replace the water every year, it is still way cheaper than buying specialized emergency water. Sorry Aqua Blox. …",15 out of 22 users found this review helpful

" These are awesome, fatty, and flavorful.",4,"These little pretzel pieces are totally addictive, which is probably not a good thing because they're a lot worse for you than you'd think pretzels should be. They have around 60 fat calories and 3 grams of saturated fat in ONE ounce, which equals out to be 15% of your daily sat fat intake per serving (one ounce). The reason they're so good AND so fatty is that the mustard/onion seasoning is in an oil that permeates through the shell of the pretzel, making them extra flavorful and not dry at all. They're a little sweet, have good mustard flavor, and the onion flavor even comes through a little (they taste like they're supposed to). I try to just grab a handful at snack time and quit while I'm ahead, but I usually end up going back for more later.

I'm glad I switched to this food. It is cheaper to buy it at Petsmart than online AND if you go to the Blue Buffalo website you can get a coupon for $5 off.

 3 Stars for Convenience - but expensive,3,I am a recovering scientist and lab rat so my thoughts on this product may be warped but here goes. Splenda (sucralose + formulation aides) is approximately 8 times sweeter than plain sugar on a cup by cup basis. A cup of Splenda contains 96 calories. Table sugar as sold in the US contains 770 calories per cup. In the US a sweetener with less than 5 calories per teaspoon is allowed to be called zero calories. Thus the normal Splenda formulation with 2 calories per teaspoon can be called zero calories and if you notice all the calorie information for splenda is based on a per teaspoon basis even if you are using a train hopper car amount to take advantage of the 2 calories per teaspoon equals 0 calories loophole. When you buy the Splenda Sugar blend formulation what do you get??? You get roughly 28 ounces of sugar and roughly 4.5 ounces of Splenda equivalent. Retail sugar goes for roughly 50 cents per pound so $1 for the sugar and retail Splenda probably 75 cents per ounce so in total retail value of the blend is $4.00-$4.50. Therefore it must be assumed that the value of measuring sugar and Splenda separately is roughly $2-$3 per package. As I said convenient but pricey. …,38 out of 41 users found this review helpful

 Save money but use with care,5,"There is known design flaw having to do with the gasket on the upper needle. You can hear the screams about that by reading the reviews for the 'My Cup'. The gasket moves too much and as a result is does not seal correctly. Green Mountain seems to not want to fix it since it means selling less over-priced coffee, which is what these machines are designed to do. 1. No matter what method I use, I have learned to carefully reach in and pull the little washer/gasket down as far as I can on the upper needle. This will ensure a better seal and avoid overflow. 2. Just as importantly when I put the DisposaKup in, I press it down to make sure the lower needle has pierced the cup completely. This will make sure you have a flow of water that streams through the cup. 3. Fill it up and then tap the cup on the counter to settle the coffee grinds into the cup, do not press the coffee down or pack it in.

 Not bad. Not bad at all.,4,"I have read some really funny reviews about this product. Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix! Brilliant deduction, Sherlock! What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup? Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars. But the taste is what you want to know about, right? The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it. Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat! It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer. Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother. Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too. So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor. Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup. My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate. She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one. No marshmallow needed. The hint of peppermint is just enough. 6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too. I think I got the cups sizes right. If I didn't, you'll figure it out. Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!

 Not so good for you ???,2,"I bought this product because I wanted to eat a healthy cereal and at the same time add more fiber to my diet. I chose All Bran because it did not contain aspartame. I got home and started reading the ingredients & realized the second ingredient is sugar and also contains high fructose corn syrup. It has 8 grams of sugar per serving, but they list a serving as only 1/3 cup. Who do they think they are kidding? An average American eats more than that for breakfast. Do they think consumers are stupid? A box of Kashi 7 Whole Grain Flakes with Black Currants & Walnuts cereal lists a serving as 1 cup and contains only 10 grams of sugar for that whole cup. Uncle Sam cereal with Real Mixed Berries contains NO added sweetner of any kind and 1 cup of it contains only 2 grams of naturally occuring sugar coming mostly from the berries. Wow! You mean a cereal manufacturer is brave enough to make a cereal without adding sugar? Yes and it is good. In comparison eating 1 cup of All Bran Buds would be consuming 24 grams of sugar. No thanks! If anyone at Kellogg's is reading this please know that people who are buying these types of cereals are not buying them primarily for the taste but for the health benefits. We are not the ""Kindergarten Crowd"" who needs sugar added to everything to get us to eat it. If I want to consume extra sugar I'll eat a cookie once in a while as a treat. If I am going to eat a cereal everyday to incorporate fiber into my diet it is not going to be one that has unneeded amounts of sugar. Why can't the big name cereal manufacturers use stevia as an alternative sweetner? It has been used for years in Europe with no known side effects. The consumers buying these types of cereals who are trying to watch their sugar consumption and increase their fiber would gladly welcome less or preferably no sugar or a healthy sweetner such as stevia. …",25 out of 35 users found this review helpful
 Starburst Fave Reds,5,This was a gift for a 74 year old friend of mine who is gravely ill but loves the red flavors. I gave it to her for her last birthday. It made her so happy and she tore right into them. …,11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Almost expired,2,"If I had to rate the Starbucks Via alone I would give it five stars. I love the product. Unfortunately I received this 50ct order yesterday (October 19) and the expiration date is December 2010. It says on the side of the box that it was produced in December 2009 with a one year expiration date. I'll probably finish it by then, but I don't appreciate getting a 10 month old food product. …",72 out of 92 users found this review helpful
 Calm Cats,5,"We moved our cats out of state two years ago and the drive took three days. One of our cats had a panic attack every hour or so. Neither cat would eat/drink/go to the bathroom the entire day--they would wait until they after they got adjusted to the hotel at night. We moved out of state again about a month ago with our two cats. We added Bach's Herbal Rescue Remedy for pets to their water every day a week prior, during, and after our move until they got adjusted to their new home. The difference between our first trip two years ago and now was like night and day. They were both laid back (not comotose-which, I understand, can happen from medications) and panic attacks were significantly reduced (if not entirely absent--it really was a smooth uneventful drive). They still didn't eat/drink/go to the bathroom until they got to the hotel but they would adjust much quicker. And, whereas two years ago they took three months to fully adjust to the move, they took no more than three days to adjust to their new surroundings this time around. I cannot say with certainty that Bach's Rescue Remedy ""caused"" them to be more calm; this was not a controlled experiment, it was their second interstate move, they stayed at ""Grandma and Grandpa's"" house while the packing was done wheras before they witnessed all our stuff being boxed up (which might have freaked them out), etc. However, I certainly think Bach's Rescue Remedy had something to do with putting them at ease the second time around. [Note: we tried Feliway (both the spray and the plug-in product) and it didn't help calm the at all.] …",13 out of 16 users found this review helpful
" Very Close to the ""Real"" Thing - Recommended",5,"Hershey's Sugar Free Dark Chocolate candy bars tastes very close to the full sugar version. Dark Chocolate was always one of my favorite treats before coming a Type 2 diabetic, so it is great being able to have it again in a sugar free version. There is a little bit of an after taste with these but dark chocolate is usually bitter so it isn't really an issue for me (but my wife says she notices more than I do). I should mention that eating too many of these (more than 3 or 4) does cause me some ""gastric distress"", so you might want to try them at home before eating a bunch while out in public.

 Not very healthy?,1,"My son loves these milks and we used to get them for him when we went to Starbucks. I was familiar with the Horizon brand and thought that the vanilla flavor would be fine. I began to notice a few times after drinking this he would say his tummy hurt or he would act sick(really tired) shortly after drinking them. I read the label and saw 29g of sugar...yeah holy cow! When we serve him a flavored milk I give him Gerbers smart sips, they have vanilla and mild vanilla flavor with 11g of sugar, I think the mild vanilla has even less grams of sugar. He still loves the taste too! I find them in the babyfood aisle at the grocery store. …",15 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Best Winter Breakfast,5,"McCann's Irish Oatmeal has more texture, fiber and flavor than your garden variety oatmeal; I think it's the best. I like to add dried fruit and raisins to it sometimes, or you can throw in brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg if you like. By the way, I can verify that it's true what they say about oatmeal's ability to lower cholesterol; my total cholesterol dropped some 30+ pts this winter (yes we had winter here in FL). Thank you McCann's, for a great product! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" The noodles, well they're great... Now as for those who disagree:",5,"First off, whoever pays $18 to ship an item that costs $1.89 will most likely already have a bitter taste in their mouth. That said, unless you live in the sticks, most civilized areas have places like Trader Joes, Whole Foods, Wild Oats, and other places. I walked five minutes to Ralphs (owned by a little company known as Kroeger) and plopped down 99 cents for these noodles. Also, if you don't know the first thing about cooking, don't expect much from these. They're not your garden variety Kraft Mac 'n Cheese out of a box (or a bag, in this case). Use your imagination (yes, what a hard task for some of you). Seasonings, other than your basic salt and pepper, can bring out quite a bit of flavor. And no, I'm not saying just basic pasta sauce either. You can make a tasty Thai dish, or even just butter and romano cheese would be nice. Just THINK before you complain. Otherwise, you can keep eating refined carbohydrates and wonder why 60% of America is fat. Okay, rant over! …",7 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Very poor quality,1,"I have done considerable reading on olive oil quality and sad to say, there is quite a bit of adulterated oil on the market. I cannot determine the true source of their oil, but each of the three bottles I purchased had a very acidic bite to it: either the oil was rancid or simply of very poor quality. Good oil will have a smooth buttery quality to it --- you can sip olive oil with the same delicateness of palate as you would wine. This oil however completely fails this test. …",8 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 The Sweet Stuff,3,"In so many ways, this is a really good jerky: low in fat from the buffalo, a nicely thick natural slab cut, slightly moist so that it has a nice bite without the toughness of leather, and a sufficiently peppery kick from a nice black pepper crust. Plus the assurance of no hormones, preservatives, or msg as shouted on the big green sticker on the package. The quality is there, no doubt. So what's wrong with it? It's right there, second on the list of ingredients -- SUGAR! This jerky is too sweet! I ordered the Peppered flavor and I was expecting a savory treat, a nice snack for the afternoons. Instead, this stuff is as sweet as maple syrup and not really what I wanted. Too bad, as I'm now stuck with 8 of these packages. For now, I'm going back to the SnackMasters brand. The quality is not as good but the flavor is many times better. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Great snack....even during battle!!,5,"I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Superstore). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it. For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product. If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it! …",51 out of 59 users found this review helpful
" Terrible, waste of money",1,"This is the worst low-carb product I have ever purchased. When using it to make pizza crust, I could not even cover half the pizza pan, and the taste was horrible. I used it to make biscuits, and they were incredibly dry and had no flavor. I tried again, adding some margarine, and they still tasted awful. I tried to make pancakes, and the batter was as thick as cement. I tried adding more liquid, but they were horrible. I cannot imagine how this product is still on the market. Krusteaz used to make WONDERFUL low-carb baking products, so I know it can be done. This stuff, however, is awful. …",12 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Excellant product - good price,5,Now makes an excellant product and Superstore provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery. The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet. 1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste. Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later. I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation. …,26 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 I Love Hersheys Peanut Butter Cups,5,"These 44 ounces of Reese's Easter Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures are perhaps the finest thing I could have bought with the eleven dollars and fifty-two cents that I spent on them. They taste just like the classic, not-Easter themed Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures, but their festive blue-and-pink wrappers are so pretty. Reese's Easter Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures are definitely my favorite way to celebrate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
