 Coffee pretty good but VERY expensive; won't order again.,2,"Well, it's my fault. I am so used to K-cups (from Superstore) coming in 2 24 cup orders, I assumed that the Green Mountain was the same. NOT! That makes this about twice the cost of every other brand. The coffee tastes pretty good, not great. There are too many other options like Van Houtte Spicy Mayan Chocolate or Cr&egrave;me Caramel, and when you subscribe they are less that 50 cents a cup. Anyway, I learned to be more careful. Buying this once was worth the lesson, but not the coffee. Just my two cents, of which I have fewer now :) …",9 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 addiction,5,"I have always loved All Sorts Licorice candy but found it difficult to find in stores. My daughter found it on your Web Site and gave it to me for Christmas.

 MORE calories per teaspoon than real sugar . . .,2,"Splenda is the best-tasting artifical sweetener that I've tasted. So why give the Splenda blend only two stars? Two reasons: a recent article in the New Yorker revealed that some of the chemists who develop artificial sweeteners--at least, one who was interviewed for the story--won't eat them because they cannot predict the long-term effects, and they are apparently afraid that there will be unpleasant consequences. Not an unreasonable concern, given the checkered past of artificial sweeteners in general. Full disclosure: I eat Splenda (though not the Splenda blends) because I KNOW sugar is bad for me, whereas we still don't know if Splenda is bad or not. I'm taking a chance and I have to accept the consequences. That said, calorie-counting consumers who read labels know that when the company says ""a half-cup [of the blended product] replaces a full cup of brown sugar,"" it applies to the calorie content, too. Which means that if you eat equal amounts of sugar and Splenda blend, you get more calories from the Splenda blend than you would from pure sugar. No kidding! Sugar has 15 calories per teaspoon, while the Splenda blends (white and brown) have 20 calories per teaspoon. Supposedly you can use less of the Splenda blend because it is ""stronger"" than sugar--but I can't tell it. I would just as soon have regular sugar if the Splenda blend has more calories, especially given the risks. Bottom line for me: Enjoy Splenda . . . but take it with a grain of salt. …",3 out of 16 users found this review helpful

" super fast shipping, free samples",5,"placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition, it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt, lemon citron flake salt, and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry, doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment). as far as product quality goes, i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet, but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping). …",13 out of 16 users found this review helpful

" Better than the standard ""Yellow"" Guayaki",4,"Guayaki organic yerba mate' was the first organic mate' I ever purchased. The flagship label in the Guayaki line is their traditional ""yellow"" organic label, which is ok but has about 25% stems, seeds, and whole leaves. I like this San Mateo Guayaki organic ""green"" label better. It is, at least to my taste, a fuller flavor than the standard Guayaki. As of 5/28/11, it is substantially cheaper than the standard Guayaki label. The San Mateo label also seems to show less yerba stems and seeds. The reason I deducted one star is the presence of (even still) too many stems and seeds as well as the uncompetitive price. Guayaki badly needs to filter their Yerba leaves in their existing products or offer a different label with pure, refined leaf. Other yerba mate' vendors offer this and it is a gaping hole in Guayaki's product line. Even though this product is more affordable than the rest of the Guayaki yerba mate' line, it is still very expensive compared to other organic and traditional yerba mate' labels from other companies. An adjustment to competitive pricing as well as attention to filtering the yerba leaves would give this product 5 stars. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 moth myths,5,"These traps are part of a program of integrated pest managemnt...ipm. They are doused with pheromones from female moths so that they attract male moths and break the breeding cycle. They work extremely well on that part of the process. In fact, the minute you open the little package with the trap male moths start fluttering at you like drunken frat boys! The second part of the program involves repelling the moths from their furry dinners. Lavender, bay and cedar in a closet help. Bagging sweaters over the summer will also help. Being green really is not easy. It takes extra steps and some research. This is the way natures works. We have killed off whatever the predator was for the moths so now we have to figure out how we can manipulate the cycle. If you think about it, however, the moths are actually kind of a good thing. If it weren't for these hair/fur eating creatures the earth would be a giant hair ball hanging in space.

 It really kills early or middle phase cancers,5,"8 years ago, I was desperate trying to find a natural remedy for my brother's early phase liver cancer since surgery would almost destroy the body and my brother won't live long after that and he was too young to lose life. Luckily my coworker suggested me to try Essiac Cancer Remedy. I did a through research on Essiac and believed this tea was going to save my brother's life and it DID. He is still well till now. Later I suggested this tea to a few more cancer patients and the results were promising. Two of them with early cancers were healed; the doctor just couldn't find any cancer trace on the pre-scheduled surgery table. There are 2 late phase cancer patients (late means cancer had been spread to different organs and the person was dying), who drank the tea and lived a few more months and died peacefully without any pain and sufferings, which proved what said in one of the Essiac books that the tea helps with a painless death if it's a Terminal cancer. I also learned that the results are much better with patients who eat little or no animal products because animal food acidifies the body, speeds up cancer spreading and weakens the immune system --- in 1931, Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize for showing that ""cancer thrives in acidic conditions."" For more information about this tea, you may read related books on ""Essiac"". I hope more western people will believe that the best heal is often the most nature and simplest which God created in the very beginning. …",68 out of 69 users found this review helpful
" Great Product, Great Bargain",5,"These have gone in price (by 50% of the original price) since I originally wrote this review but its still a bargain compared to what you pay at other retailers.

They were identical in quality to the rawhide rolls I buy at the pet store for $2.99 each!! I have a VERY active 18 month (100 lbs) yellow lab but when I give him a retriever roll he will lay down to chew and play for hours at a time.

 Mouth watering!,5,"Over the last 3 years I have sampled every major protein bar offering and I have to say these Power Crunch bars are my favorite. It has a very sugary, chocolate taste that is similar to real chocolate wafer cookies. Power Crunch does not have the thick, hard protein ""paste"" you'll find in most bars. The chocolate wafer style is soft and almost disintegrates in your mouth - quite a contrast from most protein bar offerings. I've eaten probably a dozen a week for the last six weeks and I still cannot get enough of these bars. In all fairness most protein bars have 30+ grams of protein - more than double the amount than the 14 grams in Power Crunch. So personally I consider Power Crunch to be a very healthy high protein candy bar rather than protein bar. But after tasting Power Crunch, it'll be a long time before I reach for another Detour, MET-Rx, Oh Yeah, South Beach, or any other bar. …",29 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 Wow!,5,"Cacao bean, unrefined cane sugar, and chili. That's all, and it's all organic. If the chili/chocolate mix sounds odd, think of Mexican mole sauce - this stays close to chocolate's Aztec origins. I don't judge the preparation by what goes in, though, it's the outcome that matters. What comes out is the richest chocolate taste I've ever found. This pushes far into the dark side of chocolate flavor (I mean that in a good way), but without the astringence of some of the darkest. Flavors emerge in layers on top of that bitter-sweet base: a pleasant tartness followed by a fruity overtone like none I've ever tasted, leading eventually to a mild chili tingle just vivid enough to make you pay attention. This thoroughly grown-up flavor pairs well with fresh fruit or fine spirits - I wish I had some calvados in the house. That would be an outrageous combination. The package advertises a 'rustic' texture. If you're used to the silky smoothness of Godiva and the like, get your tongue ready for sandpaper. Outside of that (and the premium price), I find nothing to complain about here. Taza makes other flavors in this line, including cinammon, vanilla, and cacao puro. Based on my experience with the chili chocolate, I'll be happy to try them all. -- wiredweird …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Hot Peppers Need Hot Weather,5,"I bought these from Think Geek instead of Superstore, and they're amazing. However, I've seen several reviews with low ratings claiming that they never grew, so I thought I'd add my review with a few tips and tricks to growing these mind-blowing peppers. 1) Ghost Chili's require hot temperatures to grow in. More specifically, these pepper seeds will not germinate in soil that is under around 75 degrees Fahrenheit. This means you need to grow them starting in late spring or even early summer if you don't want to use artificial means, to make sure its hot enough for them to sprout. If you want to grow them earlier or in the winter, you may need to heat the soil yourself. A simple heating pad wrapped around the pot set on low is typically sufficient. Ideally they like 75-95 degree temperatures. 2) You can affect how hot the peppers will be based on how you care for them. The more stressed the plant is, the hotter the peppers will be. Make sure you plant and feed your peppers while growing, but once they start producing fruit, cutting back on their water from time to time will make them hotter. Also, if you cut back on the fertilizer (Nitrogen, specifically) while they are fruiting, you'll get hotter peppers as well. Humidity also affects heat. The higher the humidity, the hotter the pepper (good news for people in the South!). And finally, the air temperature when the chili's ripen affect how hot they are as well, hotter it is outside, the hotter the peppers will be on the inside! If you keep them unstressed and in a dry climate, the peppers will end up being sweeter. They'll still be the hottest thing you ever put in your mouth though, so if you're not used to stressing plants without actually hurting them, its better to be kind to them than try to maximize their heat. Its not like your tongue will know the difference between 850k and 1 mil scovilles anyway. 3) Ghost Chili's like neutral to slightly acidic soil. A PH of 5-6 is ideal, but your standard 6.5 potting soil will be just fine. If you're not experienced with mixing your own soil, don't try it (you'll just kill the plants), use whats in the can and get regular mix from Walmart when you're ready to transplant. 4) Don't grow these in the can. Not that there's anything wrong with the can per say, it is rather small (picture looks like its coke can sized, its not, its maybe half that size). You'll need to transfer the peppers to something bigger sooner than later, and they'll be rather young when they start to outgrow the can. Moving them at that age is stressful, better to avoid it altogether by just starting with a larger pot to begin with. Ghost Chili's can be a little particular when sprouting, but they grow very well once started and they provide you with a once in a lifetime experience (because you'll never be dumb enough to bite into one a second time!). For $10, you can't go wrong with these things. And on the up side, after slipping a few of these into your cooking, you'll never be pressured to bring a side dish to a dinner ever again! ;) …",86 out of 86 users found this review helpful

Taurine, is often floated around as having an effect on cognition, but this has never been shown to be true amongst people I talk to and is more than likely added because some buff dude somewhere read something that said it helps with this and that. It does not, and you're welcomed to do your own research and call me out if you find evidence to the contrary. I gave it 2 stars because I don't ""hate it"", as it does work, but I ""don't like it"" as the cost is such a barrier for many. 2 bucks each? That's insane. In short, do your wallet a favor. Purchase the above 5 listed supplements and take them on an empty stomach and preferably in the morning (NALT will benefit the most from this regimen). Later in the day, you could do the same regimen except split a caff. tab in half so you're not up at 4am thinking about stuff you usually never think about. If you find that this stack is getting you too nervous and you're using it for learning tasks, add an L-theanine to the group and you should be good to go.

 Great taste - poor packaging wastes k-cups,3,"I love the taste of this coffee. But apparently they have poor quality control. These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly. You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to. Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem. It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens. I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them. Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing. …",116 out of 128 users found this review helpful
" To give a ""real"" review",5,"Since people can't seem to figure out that the reviews are for the products and not the companies delivering them, I've decided to write a review exclusively FOR THIS PRODUCT. Despite it's juvenile sounding name, this isn't a child's energy drink that's for sure. Each tube packs about 42,000% the recommended daily dose of Vitamin B12. The high from this is extremely stable and hasn't yet given me the jitters. I feel very awake, alert, and clear headed. I use it before a workout and several of the ingredients make it perfect for the gym. The let down is probably the smoothest you'll find among energy drinks. And if you feel a cold coming on, downing one of these may help tremendously. The name comes from the interaction the mix has with water. You pour one vile into a 16-20 oz bottle of water and the stuff fizzes like crazy! If you don't get the lid on fast enough, you'll quickly find there will be a mess! I've found using a wide mouthed nalgene bottle is the best way to prevent these types of accidents. In addition to the massive amounts of Vitamin B12, it has a good amount of Vitamin C (500mg), Niacin (10mg), Vitamin B6 (2.5mg), Calcium (60mg), Magnesium (100mg), and Potassium (905mg). It has almost every water soluble vitamin meaning that a lot of the excess that your body doesn't utilize, will be flushed through your kidneys. With that being said, drink a lot of liquid with this and don't over use the product (company recommends no more than 3 a day) or the chance of getting kidney stones exists. It has a 317mg ""proprietary"" blend blend of L-Arginine, L-Taurine, Caffeine from guarana, Alpha-lipoic acid, Grape seed extract, Green tea leaf extract, Ginger root, and Ginseng root. I don't know how much each compound contributes to the 317mg but they do acknowledge that 100mg of it is caffeine (about the same as a cup of coffee). There are multiple flavors but I'm partial to Grape and Orange Soda. The flavors are very sweet and candy-like but they surprisingly have no sugar. 10 total Calories and only 2g Total Carb. This is an excellent product and recommend it over any other energy drink. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Inconsistent at best - too many hulls,3,"I enjoy hempseed, primarily I sprinkle it over my salads to add a nutty and nutritious component. I like buying this in bulk because it saves money over the expensive 1 pound or half-pound bags I can get at the store. My complaint about this product is that you never know what you'll get. Sometimes it's fairly free of hulls (seed coats) and sometime it's just full of them And they're hard to deal with - very hard pieces of shells that interfere with the enjoyment of whatever you are eating. I guess you could spend time separating the pieces out, but that is a labor-intensive process and at that point it becomes more economical (time is money) to buy the 1 pound or half-pound bag at the store from a company that pays more attention to what they are packaging. I kust got a new shipment and it is absolutely full of seed coat fragments. Grrrrr.... …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 Simple RECIPE,5,"Perhaps some of you are like I was... wanting to take advantage of the health benefits of oatmeal, but uncertain how to prepare it so that you and your family will actually eat it. After experimenting a bit, and reading lots of recipes, I've come up with a simple, yet tasty way to prepare McCANN's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal. Give it a try, and you may decide that oatmeal can be a healthy and delicious addition to your breakfast menu. Recipe: - Start by bringing 3 cups of water to a boil (about 3-4 minutes in the microwave). - In a medium saucepot, melt 1 tablespoon of butter then add 1 cup of oats. Toast the oats on medium heat for about 3 minutes. - Add the boiling water to the toasted oats and simmer for 25 minutes. Don't stir. It should get to a soft bubbling simmer. If it boils to hard, you stove is set too hot, so turn it down or it will burn. - Add 1 cup of milk (or can do with a mix of milk and buttermilk). - Cook an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Makes 4-5 good size servings with excellent texture and consistency. It thickens once it sits a little bit. You can increase or decrease the milk to adjust the consistency as desired. You can also save it for up to a week in the refrigerator without much difference in taste. Just store in small sealed bowls. Each can of McCANNs oatmeal makes about 16-20 servings. Everyone likes to top and sweeten their oatmeal differently (sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, raisins, etc.). Only add the toppings when you're ready to eat it, not before storing in the refrigerator. For my serving, I like to add 2 tsp of brown sugar, 2 tsp of maple syrup, a sprinkle of cinnamon, about 1/2 tbsp of butter, and then top with chopped pecans. I know it's not particularly healthy, but it is very tasty. Hope you enjoy! Please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 2011 Chef's Best Award for Nong Shim's Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl,5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 2:09 Mins </span>My eight-year-old son volunteered to try Nong Shim's new flavor, spicy chicken. I made a video interview of him eating the noodles for dinner, after he came home from judo practice (hungry). Our family enjoys Nong Shim instant noodles. We stock our pantry every autumn with bowls of ramen, yakisoba and udon. Nong Shim is the leading brand of ramyoen (ramen instant noodles) in South Korea. The package design is getting better. The endorsement by Professional Chefs (a 2011 Chef's Best Award) is easier to read and three colored boxes in the lower right corner note that the noodles have no MSG added, there's 30% less sodium than their regular product and that the noodles have 0 grams of trans fat. I recommend adding refrigerator scraps to your instant noodles; perhaps, whole kernel corn (for sweetness) or some tofu, finely chopped green onions (scallions), chopped, cooked beef, chicken or seafood. An egg is another delicious addition. Rating: Five stars. Earlier this year, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, executive editor at Serious Eats, posted ""Ramen Hacks: 30+ Easy Ways to Upgrade Your Instant Noodles."" I highly recommend you search out and read the full article because you will never go back to relying on the flavoring packet alone to make instant noodles. I distilled his tips down to these four bullet points: * Simple Add-ins -- Miso paste, chili bean sauce, Thai curry paste, Japanese curry powder, fish sauce, harrisa, vinegar and ponzu. * Vegetation -- Baby spinach, romaine lettuce, bean sprouts, thinly sliced cabbage, watercress, and scallions ""should wilt in a matter of seconds."" * Eggs -- Hard boiled, soft boiled, the egg-drop method, poached eggs and fried eggs. * Simple Simmered Meat -- Thinly sliced meats cook in a matter of seconds directly in the pot. Chicken breast, pork tenderloin, or flank steak are all great candidates. Instant noodles available at Superstore that our family eats and recommends: Shim Big Bowl Noodle Udon Shim Big Bowl Noodle Kimchi Shim Beef and Ginger Bowl Shim Kimchi Noodle Bowl Ippeichan Yakisoba Noodles In many cases you can sign up for Superstore's Subscribe & Save program for additional savings and convenience. …",12 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Lovely smoke flavor,5,"Hi, I just wanna say I found this liquid smoke to be great. It gave me exactly what I was looking for--that natural smoky flavor. If you want to know, I didn't find it tasting synthetic or artificial. It tastes very natural because it is natural. The only catch is you need to calibrate your quantity when using this product. I recommend starting off conservative and adding more as you go. If you put too much to start with, you may ruin your dish. For a stew or chili, you can probably fix it by just adding more ingredients to make a bigger pot to reduce the smoke concentration. Don't pour it directly on something your grilling. Pour it into a small bowl or dish and brush it on evenly and lightly. You can always brush on more as you grill. Anyway, it's a wonderful product and I recommend it highly. I will be buying more once my 4oz bottle runs out. I hope my review has been helpful. Thanks! Scott …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" Some early details about the new Blu-ray DVD due out September 16th, 2008",4,"Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror. It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder). They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them. Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's ""Banana Boat Song"" (""Day-O""), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance. The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging. Great fun. The extras announced are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series (""Skeletons in the Closet,"" ""Spooky Boo-tique,"" ""A-Ha!""), a music-only track, the trailer and, according to the press release but not the Warners Brothers web page for this DVD, an exclusive CD soundtrack sampler. The cartoons are about 11 minutes each. Possibly more features will be announced later, but that would be unusual and I wouldn't count on it. Five-star movie, three-star extras. The new Blu-ray will be 1080p video, but the complete specs for the sound haven't been announced. There will be sound and subtitles in several languages, including Spanish. The old standard DVD isn't all that great in terms of video quality, so the best thing about this new release is likely to be improved image and sound. …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful

Simply type into any search engine ""benefits of apple cider vinegar"" and you can see for yourself. I tried Heinz while awaiting the delivery of Bragg's. The ""distilled"" ACV has virtually ZERO nutrient/health benefit...so go ORGANIC :) Concotion 3x/day: Mix 2 tablespoons of Bragg's ACV with 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. Add to 8-12 oz of water. Stir and drink. It tastes like a very light champagne or ale. I can already see the benefits from ACV. Pants already fit better after one week. The ""dark circles"" under my eyes are almost cleared up and hemorrhoids are clear as well. The most striking benefit is that I now have regular bowel movements. Before I would go 2-4 days, so this product is definitely aiding in digestion! Also, I haven't taken a Prilosec OTC or antacid in over a month. Pros: *Aids in digestion by helping breakdown of fat *Helps remove dark circles underneath your eyes *Good for varicose veins *Proven to help with Acid Reflux (GERD) *Help reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol *Lowers blood pressure *Cures hemorrhoids (from inside via drink, outside via applying to cotton ball) Cons: *More expensive than ""grocery store"" ACV *Not readily available at local rural supermarkets (leaving larger carbon footprint to have delivered to your home) Buy it by the GALLON if you're on the fence.

 Cinnamon better than any found on any food store shelf .,5,"Best cinnamon I have found and used in over 45 years of Baking. I am a repeat customer for this Frontier Cinnamon Powder (Korintje / A Grade (3% oil). On my first order, I found reviews stating the 3% Oil was a much stronger flavor and aroma than normal cinnamon (Such as McCormick's), and others just CAN""T COMPARE. AND that the Korintje cinnamon was equivalent to cinnamon so popular from CINNABUNS. I have won several ribbons for my baking, and have had some of my receipes published. I now have reqular orders and some special orders from customers that consider my Carrot Cake among the best. I give some of that credit to the use of this cinnamon in my carrot CAKE receipe, and my husband ""RAVES"" for my STICKY BUNS with pecans. I first considered and tried using less of the cinnamon, than originally called for in my receipes. (And that works well, and makes for less cost for the receipe).

 Formula changed to make it LESS healthy,1,"Boo to this. I was SO happy with it when I had finally found a low-carb cereal in which I could add my own sweetener to control how sweet I wanted it, and safely - with Stevia or something else. Even just a couple of sliced strawberries. This was the only one to fit into a reasonable daily carb allowance. Then they changed it to be sweeter and loaded up on more sugar and carbs. I complained to Kellogg and they replied that they did a taste test and found people wanted it to be sweeter. A TASTE TEST. On people that probably had no interest in its intended purpose to be a healthier option for people that actually need to watch their diets closely - they evidently didn't test for value when it came to its health benefits, they tested purely for flavor. Shouldn't this have been tested on people that WERE concerned with health...? It's that essentially the goal demographic? The general public has TONS of sugary cereals to choose from. Can't we just have ONE? You've lost my business, Kellogg, as well as many others that follow a low-carb/keto diet. I was once recommending this cereal to everyone that was trying to be more healthy so they didn't have to give up all the types of food they love--those on Atkins, Protein Power, the huge following of low-carbers on reddit, to name a few.

 3rd. order - been using for a year... now has a finer grain,5,"When I first started using this product yes, the grain was coarser but around 6 months ago, they improved that. The price initially enticed me to this product (currently about 80 cents cheaper/lb. than BRM) , but the *no sulfites* keep me coming back. Two major factors that attracted me to coconut flour were high fiber and low oxalate. I believe it's also lower in sugar on the GI/GL tables. It's also nice that there are 6 bags per carton - don't have to order it that often (vs. 4 bag cartons). There was a learning curve when I first switched (hint: bump your leavening up) in spite of buying Fife's coconut cookbook; don't waste your money unless you have no concerns over cholesterol and eating exorbitant amounts of eggs. I substitute flax ""goop"" from ground flax seed (and water) and knock the egg requirements down by at least 1/2 or 2/3! Initially, I used only coconut flour for all my baking and pancakes; I even put a Tlb. in my rice farina. Recently though, I have branched out to adding rice and/or tapioca flours to make my own gluten-free flour blend. Tip: Go to an Asian supermarket for the rice flour (non-glutenous type has less starch) and tapioca flour if you're on a budget. Also, sift your flours 3x before using/baking. Yes, it's more work and more money than wheat flour, but my quality of life has improved drastically and that's worth it!!! …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful

" So far, 5 stars",5,"After weeks of ""studying"" the Keurig coffeemaker choices and being spooked by the mixed reviews, I happened upon the commercial model, the OfficePro. Like the other reviewer, I found it at Staples for much less than listed here and less than the price of the other home models. Out of the box it didn't seem to work. There was a terrible deafening vibration and noise, and no water would transfer to the heating chamber for the priming process (the first and only step before being able to make coffee). I put it aside, annoyed, but decided to give it one more try before I packed it back up and returned it to Staples. For some reason it decided to work and it's been working flawlessly since. My particular OfficePro came with a coffee sampler which was nice because once you have it out of the box, it's great to be able to make a cup of test coffee. The first cup of coffee I made smelled just like wonderful restaurant coffee and nothing like the stale bitter coffee I was making every day (and pouring out half of) in my gross coffee pot. Since then I've been trying all sorts of coffee and experimenting with sizes and even using the K cups more than once. If you brew a small cup, you can run one more small size cup through the K cup (a bold variety) without it being too watered down - yay, a money saver. The husband and I like lots of cream so the smaller size yield suits us just fine. The 8 oz size is plenty for our mugs. I saw some complaints where the water chamber is too small and has to be refilled all the time, but as we're not using this in an office setting, it's been absolutely no problem for us. Filling the water chamber is fast and easy. Initially I used tap water in the machine but have switched to bottled to ensure that it continues to work well. Aesthetically it looks really nice and tidy tucked back into a corner on our kitchen counter and the bonus is that I can refill the water and open and close the coffee pod without having to pull it out from under the overhead cabinets; there's plenty of clearance. It makes some vibration and noise when the water heats up but the noise is very temporary, maybe about 5 seconds. So far we've had this about a week and it's fantastic with great tasting coffee and tea. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

Guess what the in-laws are getting for Christmas??? :o) I LOVE bacon, as does my husband and neither of us liked it. It's loaded with MSG, so be careful. If you want to add a bacon flavor to something, ADD BACON, there is no substitute. If you are vegan or vegetarian - you shouldn't WANT the taste of bacon on anything, so get over it. I really do not recommend this product. If you REALLY want to try it, I have four barely used bottles I'll send you for the shipping cost. I want them out of my house! …",13 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 Very poor taste for this dark roast,2,"I've given the ""Fuhgeddaboudit"" roast a few days to see if I just needed to get used to the flavor, but it still tasted weak with a bit of an ashy aftertaste to me this morning. I've tried selecting the smallest size on my Keurig, but it still has that weak gas station taste.. now with smaller volume so I can chug it faster. I've gone through 10 of my 36 cups without any of the quality control issues others have talked about. I just really don't like this roast. For reference, I tend to enjoy Jet Fuel and Dark Magic roasts... and was hoping for something similar here. I would give it one star for taste, but added a star because of the creative dispenser structure of the box and the cheaper price. In this case, I did get what I paid for I guess. …",11 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Rice Krispies Treats Cereal. Best Thing. EVER,5,"First off i was a bit weary due to other reviews sayin the cereal was expiring soon. My cereal came packed very well, 4 boxes of beautiful rice krispies treats cereal which didnt expire for about 8 months. opening the first box was epic...those first big chunks were huge! and despite shipping the cereal was in great condition. Now, as someone who eats cereal once maybe twice a week, i tell you this. all 4 boxes were gone in a week. This cereal is simply AMAZING. childhood memory lane. i ordered frankenberry and booberry afterwards too, but this cereal is 10x better then both. Fortunately, i found a specialty store which carries this cereal :) but had i not, i would be spending alot more money on Superstore. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Vegetable juice on the go,5,"Nutritionists recommend that you get a serving of vegetables with every meal, but how to accomplish that with a breakfast has always been a tough one for me since I don't like starchy vegetables like potatoes, and aside from cutting up a tomato, few other things go well with yogurt, egg whites, oatmeal, or any of the other stuff I like in the morning. A simple glass of V8 works perfectly. I've always loved V8 juice for that reason, but found it just a tad too salty. The low sodium version has made V8 perfect in my opinion. It has more flavor than most tomato juices, with a nice hint of celery seed. (It also makes a mean **** Mary!). These cans are perfect for taking with you in the car. They're not as cheap as the large 48oz bottles, but for the sake of convenience, they're well worth it. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Excellent value,5,"I am an ""expert"" in dulce de leche as I was dipping my fingers in a dulce de leche jar before I could handle a spoon, born and raised in Buenos Aires I grew up with Gandara as the best, we used to get it on our way to Mar del Plata. That been said to establish my ""credentials"" and been opinions on taste so personal, I believe this is a good value for my money, I use it as a spread on toasts with my breakfast and as a ""sweet treat"" by the spoon when my wife does not look at me in the evening after dinner. The taste is not outstanding nor the texture, BUT, at a couple of dollars a can, I do not think twice about using it, the more polished, tasty brands at anywhere 7 to 12 dollars the same amount is to me abusive, I like to eat it without thinking how much each spoon, but each one its own. If you want to add dulce the leche to your daily ""sweet"" choices, this is as good as it gets, if you are looking for ""gourmet"" more sophisticated sweet, you will likely be disappointed. PS: after opening the can I transfer the content into a glass jar with a tight lid and of course keep in the refrigerator. TIP:keeping refrigerated makes it a little hard to spread on soft surfaces like cakes,crepes etc, ""a touch"" of microwave is the solution,SECONDS NOT MINUTES. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Poor Packing,2,"The honey is great, but I have ordered this product 4 times from Superstore and only one made it in one piece. This is the most incompetent packing job I have ever seen! I even called once and told the person that answered the phone to make sure it is packed in a 6 X 6 X 6 box in an upright position with the lid taped around the perimeter with packing tape. He said he would notify the shipping dept. It arrived in one of the same boxes they use for books with an air pillow on top of the jar. The jar was lying in the bottom of the box with the lid off and honey everywhere! Superstore needs to have a special training class on packing for the people that work in the shipping department(s)! …",135 out of 155 users found this review helpful
 Techno-BEST,5,"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek. There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine. The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup. This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion. It's easy to hold and get out of the machine. The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier. This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut. Ingenious. Kudos to these guys. …",69 out of 71 users found this review helpful
 Wake Up To Caffienated Perfection!,5,"We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch. It is rich, syrupy and just a bit sweet. My experience, thus far, has been that the K-Cups listed as ""extra bold"" produce the best cups of coffee, but many of those are only available in dark roasts, while I prefer a medium roast. If you're a fan of a good, old fashioned diner-style cup of coffee (like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that), then this is the brew for you. We love it and make sure we always have some on hand. …",53 out of 54 users found this review helpful
 Melitta Padfilter a total flop,1,"If it sounds too good to be true, it's too good to be true. Thought I was making a good investment in purchasing this item. Turns out it is useless. The filter prevents the coffee maker from completely sealing once it is placed in Senseo coffee maker, so once you clamp down lid and press botton to make coffee it leaks hot water all over the place, making a big mess. Also, the rich foamy coffee you get with Senseo pods is nowhere to be seen. I used Starbucks. It did not foam up and it was weak, weak,weak. The podfilter was fully loaded with coffee. Even on the 1 cup setting the coffee was weak. FOLKS YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS ITEM. IT'S NO WONDER. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND KEEP BUYING THE SENSEO PODS IF YOU WANT A GREAT CUP OF COFFEE AND FORGET ABOUT BEING A CHEAPSKATE.

 Neo  water  9.5 ph ordered on Superstore.com,3,"I don't think it was the water to blame. I think I just didn't research it well enough before I ordered it. The ph 9.5 burned my throat, and sent me to the emergency room thinking I was dying of something respiratory. The doctor said it was similar to a bad case of bronchitis and reflux. He didn't know I drank a bottle of 9.5 ph alkaline water. I think the 9.5 ph was just too strong. I should have ordered 8.0 I think. I also wasn't sure it was the water that caused my symptoms. When I got home I started putting it all together. …",3 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 half of the bag is amazing,3,"These chips are quite literally a mixed bag. If not for the yucca chips (I think it's the yuccas), this would be a solid 5 star bag of chips. The problem with the yucca chips is that they are very hard and difficult to chew. The reviewer below who complained of jaw problems after eating them was not off the mark. I had minor jaw pain myself after eating them. I am not sure why, but half to most of the bag consists of these undesired tooth killers. They are also the chips with the least flavor out of the bunch, so I'm guessing they are also the cheapest to produce. It's a shame, because the yuccas are really dragging this bag of chips down and keeping me from recommending it. Get with it, Terra! …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 A great product!,5,"This pinole is a great product! It tastes great and is properly advertised. My husband and I use the pinole with water, almond milk or soymilk before and/or during our long runs which helps provide a lot of much-needed energy. We've even tried it warm (drank it like tea) and my husband has added it to his morning, pre-run coffee with excellent results. This pinole really is a versatile product that I highly recommend. The shipping was a little pricey considering the cost of the product, but it is coming all the way from California so I guess that's about right. We had no problems at all with the Seller. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Best Chili Ever,5,"This dandy chili mix makes great chili. It is one of the best things I have tasted in a long time. It has a clever concept, which explains why it is a `kit'. The bag has 4 separate packets: a main chile packet (the chili powder has almost no heat, but lots of flavor), a small packet of cayenne, a small packet of salt, and a larger one with masa harina. This way, you adjust the heat, salt, and thickness to your liking; some chile mixes has everything combined, and you cannot change it. One kit is enough for 2 pounds of meat, so larger batches will require more kits. Course, I did not follow the included recipe. I tossed the salt (I used sea salt instead) and masa flour (it was plenty thick without it) packets, used beef chuck cut into 1 ½ inch cubes instead of ground beef (course, it took that much longer to cook, but so what?), and all of the cayenne packet. Boy was it good. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Not Exactly what I Expected,4,"First off, my true gut feeling on the rating is a three. I am giving it a four because the I think the company is really good, the product was shipped fast and was packed really well. I am not super happy with the Trident Maple Forest but I am not totally disappointed either. I really didn't know what to expect since this item had not been reviewed before, I couldn't find too many photos, and I have never ordered anything that is alive on the internet. My main disappointment is probably due to my own ignorance with bonsais. I have had a few various bonsais before and have sadly killed them all. I had seen the Trident Forest in a brochure before and really wanted it awhile ago. The idea of a ""mini forest"" sounded really neat. I also love maple trees so it really seemed perfect. When I received my bonsai today I was a little disappointed when I saw the trees. Basically they look like someone cut tree limbs off a maple tree and put them into a pot. Now, that may be how bonsai trees are made and I just don't know. I thought that maybe these were mini trees that were grown from a seed and pruned and trained to be small. But, as I said, I don't know much about bonsais. I am also disappointed in that I read when making a forest one should really try not to put the trees in any order or try to make them symmetrical. My forest is almost arranged in a perfect oval shape. Also, the largest ""tree"" is very loose and feels like it may pop out of the soil any moment. So, some of my trees look like a stick off a tree with maybe 10 small leaves on them and the top of the ""tree"" pruned diagonally. Now, am I planning on returning the product? No, probably not unless it starts looking sick in the next two weeks or one of the trees falls out of the pot. I think it is a cute bonsai and am hoping I can take really good care of it and get it to grow some more leaves and fill out. To be honest, if I had seen this in a store for 100 dollars I would not have ever considered buying it. So I am giving it a four because it was shipped fast and packed really well. It only lost about 10 leaves which I think is pretty good. Some of the leaves are wilted but I am assuming it is because of them being in the dark box for a few days. I also don't want to rate the tree too low because I really didn't know what to expect so I want to be fair to the product and company. I also love the leaves that is does have. I took photos of it packed, me unpacking it, and the tree by itself. I am hoping to post these photos on Superstore. I hope this helps you decide if you want one. Like I said, it is small and cute but definitely not like the photo posted on Superstore. It is not thick with leaves or stems but this may be due to the season. Oh, and my tallest tree is 13 inches from the soil to the top of the stick. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee,5,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday. I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now). However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee. I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"". Enter Donut Blend. I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family. When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it. Here is my take on it: It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity. Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii. It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee. If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup. Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one. Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.

 An Excellent Source of Nutrition,5,"I love Goji berries and often eat them after my weight work-outs. I also throw them in the following cereal (raw & vegan), they make a perfect harmony in this recipe as follows: Oatmeal Cereal Raw & Vegan - the Most Wholesome Cereal on Planet Earth: inspired to me by the Wonderful Magic Man, Peter Ragnar: 1/4 to 1/2 cup whole Oat Groats these look like buff colored pieces of rice, you will need to sprout them in filtered water one to two nights beforehand. So they will be ready for you in the morning. I think two days of soaking is best. 1/4 cup Goji Berries 3/4 cup blueberries slices of banana and any other berry or fruit as you wish 1 cup refrigerated filtered water (trust me you want it cold..tastes good) 1/2 t vanilla extract Himalayan Salt or Sea Salt 4 brazil nuts (soaking unnecessary because these don't have enzyme inhibitors) 2 T hemp seeds (Nutiva brand is good) a bit of honey optional In good blender pour 1 cup water, salt to taste, vanilla extract, hemp, brazil buts and honey if you want it (I don't use it). Blend up really well until a smooth creamy milk forms - this is amazing milk folks! Now put all soaked oat groats, berries and whatnot in a cereal bowl.
