 Disappointed in Search Engine,3,"I thought I was ordering unsweetened, since I typed ""Almond Milk Unsweetened"" in the search bar. This product came up as the #2 selection, and the price was good, so I bought it. After it arrived, I noticed that it had cane sugar in the ingredients. You would think with unsweetened in the search engine, Superstore would do a better sorting job than to have a sweetened version as the #2 choice. My fault for not looking more closely. Live and learn, the Superstore search engine isn't perfect. Since I cannot have sugar, I cannot rate the product. …",5 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" Don't bother with this if you are an athlete, vegan or healthy!",1,"While this product works with many others I know, it doesn't work for me at all. The only reason I cite that stands out for me is I eat healthy, I maintain an active lifestyle and I get enough of rest, so in the mid afternoon when I have the 5 Hour energy drink, I still feel sleepy and I can sleep through it without feeling energetic (I work out in the morning). I'd love to hear comments from others who do have a healthy, active (vagan) lifestyle and still find this energy drink valuable. …",7 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Mexican is quite good,5,"Real Mexican chocolate of any version will be much better than mass produced American chocolate simply because the cocoa content is much higher (as w/ European chocolate). This is REAL dark chocolate w/ a little spice and sugar. I do not think it requires any additional sugar when I make it since I want the dark chocolate flavor. I use a whisk and it comes out delicious. I think this is one of the best products Nestle makes and about the only one I consistently purchase. In fact I'm going to try the powder mix version for convenience, but since the chocolate will be further processed, it probably won't be as good. However, it also received positive reviews. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Liquid Aminos,5,"I have used this product for over 15 years. I use it to enhance the flavour of many vegetarian dishes. I also use it for fish and sushi soy sauce. My only problem with it is that I ordered this twice from Superstore in the last 4 years or so, and each time the bottles leaked during transportation. I am not sure what they could do to prevent this from happening in the future. But it is a concern. Do not order any books with it, they shipped everything in the same box, and everything got soaked with it. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Good ingredients?  I don't think so....,2,"Let me start with a positive.... Superstore saved a lot in shipping with these syrups. If you order directly from the manufacturers web site, you will probably pay twenty dollars or more in shipping which is outrageous! Now the negatives... I was born and raised in Hawaii and the delicious shave ice there is a common treat, much like ice cream in the continental US. Sorry, but these syrups barely taste like the ones in Hawaii. I sampled the cherry and it tasted very much like cherry cough syrup, yuck! But that's not what really ticked me off. Looking at the ingredients listed on the bottle, instead of cane sugar (which Hawaii used to produce and distribute in abundance), the second main ingredient listed after water is high fructose corn syrup. Double yuck! I'll stick with the Davinci syrups which use cane sugar and to me and my kids, taste a lot better. This company needs to rethink it's ingredients, especially when they claim they use quality ingredients. …",53 out of 60 users found this review helpful

 The world's best cold remedy.,5,"The product description calls the Orangettes ""Belgian Vitamin C."" Except for the luxury price, I'm sure Belgians must be pretty healthy with these around. They're amazing! The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular, but Leonidas does it very well. The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet). Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion. The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying. I don't know if these guys are really going to improve your health, but they will definitely improve your day. In my opinion, they're worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one-time try. The packaging is a gold box, wrapped in blue and white Leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box. For shipping, the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell. Mine arrived within three days and looked like I'd purchased them at the store to give as a gift. …",31 out of 31 users found this review helpful
" Coconut Flour - Think outside the box, be creative",5,"I must say that for me Bob's Red Mill Coconut Flour has been my latest favorite find. Overall, I am a stickler for quality and this brand has that base covered. I have added this Coconut Flour into my smoothies with fab results. My intial reason for purchasing this product was not as a ""sub"" flour to use as baking, but rather as an easy, quick and hopefully nice tasting fiber boost. Heck, it doesn't add any sugar. Carb level is fine, fat level is fine (for my purposes). Well, nice tasting it certainly is! The texture is as fine as baby powder. Blends in seamlessly to my smoothies and now I have started to add to my homemade sauces and dressings. It adds to the smooth texture & consistency, nice subtle flavor and for the fiber boost. This product does not have a ""bowl you over"" coconut flavor. In fact, when I use quite a bit of it in my smooties, it has a slight hint of coconut ... not even enough to register on my boyfriend's unsuspecting palette. Don't rely on published recipes to harness the value of this product. Explore and do what you want. NOTE about the fiber boost: My latest research points to 35g of fiber being a target amount for daily consumption. I add a fiber boost here and there and it adds up …",122 out of 125 users found this review helpful
 I should NEVER have purchased this product!,5,"I purchased this product to make fudge with. I reasoned that I could make partial batches of specialty fudges by weighing out the sweetened condensed milk. WELL, the dispenser top on the container made this product just tooooooooo accessible. Reviewer ""Paisleymonsoon"" made it quite clear that this product had a sinister nature and that it could prove unholy to have it in your home. SO, I said to myself, ""Self, you know you don't have an addictive personality, that is for weak people, and you've never been weak."" Reviewer ""Just Smile"" also tried to warn potential buyers, but did I listen? NO! My husband is not into sweetened condensed milk (actually I have not asked him, I decided that I wanted, in this case, to assume) and I have not offered any to our pets either. You cannot share this with an animal that will eat anything, that would border on sacrilege. SO, since there is no one else to partake, and the lid bears a remarkable similarity to a delivery device, I have found that direct hits from a refrigerated bottle of it is as good as any a way to consume the mandatory amount necessary to sate my ferocious addiction. I suggest that sane, refined, civilized persons pass this product by, for the good of their own self-esteem, and for the good of their sane reputations.

 THESE CHIPS HAVE MSG (Monosodium glutamate ) IN THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!,3,"Answer Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a flavor enhancer commonly added to Chinese food, canned vegetables, soups and processed meats. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified MSG as a food ingredient that is ""generally recognized as safe,"" the use of MSG remains controversial. MSG has been used as a food additive for decades. Over the years, the FDA has received many anecdotal reports of adverse reactions to foods containing MSG. But subsequent research found no definitive evidence of a link between MSG and the symptoms that some people described after eating food containing MSG. As a result, MSG is still added to some foods. A comprehensive review of all available scientific data on glutamate safety sponsored by the FDA in 1995 reaffirmed the safety of MSG when consumed at levels typically used in cooking and food manufacturing. The report found no evidence to suggest that MSG contributes to any long-term health problems, such as Alzheimer's disease. But it did acknowledge that some people may have short-term reactions to MSG. These reactions -- known as MSG symptom complex -- may include: Headache, sometimes called MSG headache Flushing Sweating Sense of facial pressure or tightness Numbness, tingling or burning in or around the mouth Rapid, fluttering heartbeats (heart palpitations) Chest pain Shortness of breath Symptoms are usually mild and don't require treatment. However, some people report more severe reactions. The only way to prevent a reaction is to avoid foods containing MSG. When MSG is added to food, the FDA requires that ""monosodium glutamate"" be listed on the label -- or on the menu, in restaurants. MORE ON THIS TOPIC Migraine Sodium: Are you getting too much?

" "" A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!""",5,"I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try ""Natural Calm""; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot. I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because ""Natural Calm"" does the job. I've been taking ""Natural Calm"" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff. As for negatives to ""Natural Calm""...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick. All in all 5+ stars. ""Natural Calm"" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer. …",39 out of 47 users found this review helpful

I am a real fan of hot sauce, hot peppers and anything that makes my eyes water, and I have to honestly say that Dave's Insanity Sauce is absolutely the hottest thing I've ever tasted. I use one drop in about 25 ounces of home-made tomato sauce and it makes the sauce noticibly hot. This is NOT a sauce to dash into your soup or to liven up some salsa. DON'T USE IT LIKE TABASCO!!! It is a heavy-duty hot sauce that should be used as in ingredient when cooking a decent amount of a dish. My brother doubted its powers so I poked the end of a toothpick into the sauce and gave it to him. The poor guy freaked and ate more Italian bread than I've ever seen anyone eat in my life.

" Mmmmmm, Vanilla Flavored Coffe",5,"My wife first found this in Walgreen's and bought both Vanilla and Hazelnut flavors just to try them out. And here is our verdict: WE LOVED THEM. The Vanilla one, that is. We didn't care for the Hazelnut too much. And since my wife hates favors in her coffee you can say that the Vanilla flavored Splenda is really good. Now why would I mention by name where she bought it first? Well because you should know that it cost us a dollar more per box that what we would have spend here in Superstore. And since this product qualifies for free shipping it's a no lose situation. Here is a little more on this item: The Vanilla Splenda tastes like... well, Vanilla; the good vanilla, not the artificial stuff. It's delicate and subtle. You can easily taste both the vanilla and your favorite ground coffee separately and yet appreciate how wonderfully they come together. (Can you tell that I am sipping a hot cup of vanilla flavored coffee as I am writing?) The Hazelnut Splenda is a little too roasted for my taste, and in my opinion it kind of kills the otherwise nutty hazelnut flavor. But don't let that stop you from at least trying it. You might like it a lot more that we did. THERE IS NO AFTERTASTE. I hate Nutra Sweet because of that. Splenda No Calorie Sweetener comes in three flavors Vanilla, Hazelnut and Mocha. I give Vanilla 5 stars, Hazelnut 4 Stars and I have not tasted the Mocha yet. But if you are wondering if you should try this product, the answer is YES, go for it, you will love it.

The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because of the lid - that IS handy, I must admit. But you can buy ice cube trays with lids too, that will actually fit in your freezer and stack well.

 Non-Instant Dry Milk (tips),5,"Even though I just did a review for Barry Farm, which is a highly reputable supplier, for their INSTANT non-fat dry milk powder... I ACTUALLY prefer the NON-instant dry milk powder. One reviewer sought for their ingredient list. I pointed out that the ingredient list IS actually (the label) on the package; the product is simply dry milk powder (whether instant, as in that case, or non-instant in this one). I added: The fact these powders taste sweet may also be a very good indication they products are FRESH. Since any dry milk only has a 6-month shelf life, you seldom want to purchase large quantities. Only buy quantities you will use within 6 months. Whereas, any classic off-taste people dislike about powdered milk is when the dry milk is old. Another reviewer stated she makes superior YOGURT with non-instant powdered milk, which I do too. (Tips & Techniques...) For any who wish for information how to reconstitute this product. Combining 2 1/2 Tbsp NON-instant powder with 1 cup water = 1 cup milk (should be correct). The easiest way to blend, is with an immersion blender. Superstore offers one by Cuisinart, at an affordable price see CSB-77 Smart Stick Hand Blender with Whisk and Chopper Attachments . I wish to add that I also make Better Baking Buttermilk (aka: BBB) with non-instant powdered milk, to make much better breads!

" Good coffee, but 26.3 ounces, not 32.",3,"This coffee was very good, being at least the equal of the best of the 7 different coffees I have tried thus far here from Superstore. It was very fresh, had excellent aroma, and produced a very nice brew in my French press. Upon receipt of the coffee I noticed that the bag was nowhere near full. I have had other coffees come in less-than-full bags, but this one seemed to be way off. Since I sell merchandise online myself, I have an accurate postal scale. The ""2 pound"" bag came in at almost 6 ounces less than a full 32, including the weight of the bag. From previous orders from Superstore, other coffees seem to be based on the ""as delivered"" weight, not on some sort of weight prior to roasting. The bag itself did not have a breather, so it is hard to imagine that almost 20% of the weight was lost in shipping. Don't know what happened here but the result is that I feel I payed almost 20% more for the beans than the advertised price. I am curious if others have noticed this from this company. I would like to think that I simply got a careless shipment and not a care-less policy. …",27 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 A box full of Surprises!,5,"I just received the spice box and I can say without reservation that I am 100% satisfied. Everything one needs for a good Indian dish is in the spice box.

Be warned, however, the spice box has a very powerful smell so much so that I had to contain my in a plastic bag and tie it because the smell of 30 different spices together was overpowering my small kitchen. Once in the bag the smell dissipated. Enjoy cooking! …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 excellent for my boston!,5,"Before switching to Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon, my boston terrier seemed to have negative reactions to everything he ate. His stools were consistently soft and he frequently broke out in rashes and would scratch and itch until he bled. We kept trying new brands of dry food hoping to find something that agreed with him. We were amazed how quickly things turned around when we started him on Blue Buffalo. His stools are finally normal and his skin has never looked better. His coat is even shiny! I'm so glad we found this product! …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Claim victory in taste and nutrition!,5,"I am a college freshman and have become particularly concerned with my nutritional habits over the past couple of years because my father is on the verge of becoming diabetic. In hopes of avoiding gaining the ""freshman fifteen"" this year and in maintaining my dietary goals, I've stocked up on Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa Mix. It provides me with the sweet fix I need when I'm craving chocolate and don't want to calorie splurge. I used to be a Starbucks junkie, and before my dietary turnaround, I downed my grande (16 ounce) Starbucks Signature Hot chocolate as if it was water. When I became aware that my formerly innocent, non-fat, no-whip, winter refreshment still had 410 calories and 42 grams of sugar in it, I began my search for a better alternative. In discovering Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa Mix, now I am able to get an even greater satisfaction with the 25-calorie miracle packet that transforms plain water into my favorite treat. Without the addition of milk, it is essential to add a large spoonful of Splenda to reach optimal taste. When I first tried the mix without artificial sweeteners and mixed with only water, I was very disappointed at how bland the flavor was. However, now, with a heap of Splenda, a Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa Mix packet, and a mug of steaming water, I claim victory in taste and nutrition. I began buying Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa when I found it at my local grocery store, Pavilions. It would cost around $5.25 a box, and with six packets in each box, around 88 cents per packet. At Superstore , I am able to purchase the mix in bulk and in purchasing a case of six boxes, each packet costs me 31 cents, saving me 57 cents per packet. Some reviewers have claimed that the hot cocoa clumps up in mixing it with water. This has occurred to me several times when my water was too hot. Avoid boiling hot water, and stir as you pour the water into the mug with the hot cocoa mix and Splenda already in it, and you should no longer encounter this problem. I have experimented in using sugar-free chocolate syrups to make hot cocoa instead of using a mix and have been highly disappointed with the results. The syrup does not mix as well, and the texture of the hot cocoa is too thin, especially if just mixing the syrup in water. After a long day of studying in the library and a snowy trek back to my dorm, a mug of Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa with a heap of Splenda and a spritz of cinnamon is my always highly anticipated reward. …",33 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 Good for cats - Loved by cats,5,"Approximately 20 years ago, I began to exclusively feed our cats Iams or Science Diet. Those brands were recommended by our Veterinarian after our first cat showed signs of Feline Urinary Syndrome (FUS). I had previously fed the cats the typical brands such as 9 Lives, Purina and Friskies. I continued with IAMS and Science Diet, because the other brands caused FUS, caused other digestive problems and the good reputation of IAMS and Science Diet. Then last year, one of our cats developed bladder disease and died. Not long afterward, the pet food scandal broke. Cat and dog food from nearly every pet food company, including premium foods like IAMS and Science, were tainted by melamine. More than 150 brands of cat and dog food were recalled. IAMS and Science Diet were two of the recalled brands, as was natural sounding brands such as Nutro. I vowed to never again purchase pet food from the brands that had betrayed my trust. I began searching for pet food that was all natural and organic. Newman's Own is both natural and organic. It was also one of the few brands not recalled. Although it was difficult to find a local source, I finally found a few, including Superstore. My cats love Newman's Own canned and dry food. They also love Innova EVO. I love it because I don't have to worry about tainted food poisoning my cats. Pros: 1. Peace of mind 2. Does not cause FUS, as did Purina and other similar brands 3. Much less likely to be tainted by lethal contaminants 4. The cats love it 5. Does not cause the other digestive problems. Cons: 1. It is more expensive than the non-premium brands 2. It can be difficult to find a nearby store that sells Newman's Own. Overall, the pros outweigh the cons. And I can now add Superstore to my list of sources for the food. …",70 out of 70 users found this review helpful
 Perfect formula for an organic family,5,"Love this formula. All of the nutrition, none of the ridiculous ****. My son started to self-wean around 8 months, which was devastating for me since I know the wonderful benefits of human milk for human babies. I researched a TON--from goat's milk, to raw milk, to every formula under the sun. This was the best option I could find. The ease of not having to refrigerate it, combined with it being the closest to human milk as you can get--even down to tasting slightly sweet. Yes, I tasted it. I love that they have a lactose-free option that isn't soy. Soy mimics estrogen and should not be fed to infant boys. Or girls, for that matter. It does tend to be foamy when you shake it up, but we just scooped it off with a spoon--no biggie. Even if we didn't remove the foam, son didn't get gassy from it. I know it says it's a Toddler Formula for 12 months and up, but that is because the company is a proponent of breastfeeding for the first year. I actually think it's admirable for them to do that. This company's obviously not like the mass-market big brands. …",34 out of 40 users found this review helpful
 High Quality My Dog Enjoys and My Budget Does Too!,5,"My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy. Because he eats it heartily, I don't worry that he's getting enough high quality food. Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void. There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills. A definite cost effective WIN:WIN for doggie AND me. I've had great results with Newman's Dog Food that I orderd through Superstore BUT there's 5 pounds LESS for about the same price. Psst I'm not an organic fanatic, it's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids! Update 3/26/2011: Noticed this has jumped to almost THIRTY BUCKS, will opt for Newman's Organic when the costs per pound are the same...my dog likes BOTH Harmony and Newman, my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase :) Update 5/17/2012: Last batch Of Harmony Farms I ordered had a rancid oil smell when I opened the bag and the pooch wouldn't eat it as readily as he has in the past. He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash. I subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods, cooked brown rice etc as mix-ins to ""encourage"" him to make it through this pricey bag. Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly. I probably should have called Customer Service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the HOT weather here. Definitely exploring hot weather alternatives. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",33 out of 48 users found this review helpful
 Hands Down the Best Bold Coffee T-Disc Available,5,"I drink strong black coffee. After sampling all the bold brew T-Discs available, and prior to the release of Starbuck's Africa Kitamu, I was a faithful user of their Verona discs. That all changed with my first sip of the Africa Kitamu coffee. The strength is decidedly bold but not bitter. The best description may be that it is very smooth. It is absolutely delicious, and Africa is now my first choice and new favorite. The coffee is also a wise choice for those who like a lighter brew. Simply use the manual override procedure on the Tassimo coffee maker to add extra water to taste. In the process, an even larger cup of coffee is created. With each new release, Starbucks's has added significant quality to the T-Disc line and is quickly making my Tassimo indispensable. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

The smell was so bad that I ran to wash my hands and I refused to put that in my hair or on my skin. It melted into basically water, as for that part maybe that was expected to happen because it's an oil. On the other hand, the smell I doubt was supposed to be that potent and bad. I will be throwing it away because I cannot use it or give it away to anyone. …",4 out of 15 users found this review helpful
" "" A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!""",5,"I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try ""Natural Calm""; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot. I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because ""Natural Calm"" does the job. I've been taking ""Natural Calm"" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff. As for negatives to ""Natural Calm""...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick. All in all 5+ stars. ""Natural Calm"" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer. …",39 out of 47 users found this review helpful

 The taste gets sickening after awhile,3,"I don't know if the St. John's Wort herb tastes really bad or something, but this tea definitely covers up the taste. It tastes really licorice-y, it's like a slightly milder version of their Egyptian licorice tea. You can somewhat taste the other spices like cardamom, but the strong licorice taste got to me after awhile and I really did not like it. But if you love licorice tea, then I'm sure you'd like it. I decided to edit this review, since not everyone though it was helpful. Ok, first of all, I mention the licorice part because, well, if you know your herbs, licorice is also good for heart burn, but has the side effect of being a mild laxative. As for the St. John's Wort herb part: the herb is not too strong in Yogi's tea, and I prefer to use pure St. John's Wort from Alvita. Yes, it taste awful and I have to put a teaspoon of honey for half a cup of tea, but it works for me (I use 2 dosages and 4 pills of Enzymatic Therapy St. John's Wort pills because I can't drink that many cups of this herb with its taste. But the tea is more effective for me--I think my body absorbs it better in a natural form, which is normal for vitamins). And another note: just like perscription medication, this does not work in an instant. For me, it takes about a week to truely get the effects. My review is for people who decide to do alterative therapy who are diagnosed with mild to moderate depression. …",16 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Don't be decieved by appearances- these are delicious!,4,"I've been a huge Jelly Belly fan all my life, but as jelly beans go, they're too expensive for regular indulgence. Belly Flops can be quite ugly, but they retain the intense and interesting flavors of their more attractive brethren. The only differences are cosmetic, generally in shape and size, and the lower price point. My only caveat is that the flavor distribution is irregular; you will almost certainly not get the full range of flavors, and several flavors (presumably those with particular problems on the production line) will predominate. The last batch I bought had quite a few of the Sours flavors, while the one before that had no Sours at all. Fortunately, there are only a few flavors that I dislike, but if you're pickier, this product might be too much of a gamble. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 This one supplement has changed my life!!!!!,5,"I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.) None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life. That is, until Natural Calm. This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically! Here are the things this supplement has helped with: Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night. Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations. Mood--- Made me generally happier. Decreased muscle cramping and soreness. Improved gums and teeth. Improved hair loss. Improved digestion and transit time. Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too! But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really. There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Superstore if you want more science of magnesium.) I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement. If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want. Here's wishing you great health! …",37 out of 46 users found this review helpful

 Revised Rating,5,"At the time of my original comment, the product description did not appear to match the item that I received, in that it was advertised as 100% Wasabi, but the product I received appeared to have horseradish and mustard in it. So it seems that there may have been a mixup between the product and description, which may have been entirely unintentional and an accident. The product itself and description apparently have changed, apparently all for the better. So, I am changing my rating to a 5 star. I have to wonder if the color of the iodine-starch reaction produced is not merely based on 1) the amount of starch, but also 2) the ratio of iodine concentration to starch concentration to insure there is enough of each reagent to react, 3) the temperature, 4) the type of solvent, and 5) the type of iodine used. I did my test with a special low concentration organic iodine, Iodine Trichloride. That said, I'm glad that the seller has sorted this out and is now selling a product that matches its Superstore description. I hope everyone trys this product now, because it looks like a great deal for dried 100% Wasabi powder. Enjoy! …",17 out of 19 users found this review helpful
" very good, if you know how to mix it",4,"I read all the reviews and decided I did not want to eat all the calories and fat in one setting (seriously, each package is so small i think I can finish it in 4 or 5 bites). So I looked around the house for something I can mix this with, and then it hit me, oatmeal. I had some McCann's steel cut oatmeal. I mixed 1 and half cup of dry oatmeal, cooked it first for around half an hour. When it's ready, I threw in the pudding. The result was FANTASTIC, it was not overly sweet and had plenty of flavor, not to mention, the pudding just got 10 times healthier because the oatmeal is high fiber and low calories. Perfect for breakfast. In addition to oatmeal, I can think of several other things that you might consider mixing this pudding with. Cake mix (then bake the cake, of course), rice congee (add a variety of beans for even more flavor), and pumpkin pie. Just be creative and dont eat this by itself, the flavor would so sweet and rich that it would make you sick.

 Best price for Chimes,5,"After trying Chimes in the smaller store bought bags, I found a new treat I love. The Mango pairs nicely with the Ginger in these chewy little candies. The sweetness smooths the spicy side of the ginger leaving me with a happy mouth. (And nice breath as an added bonus). I usually enjoy one or two a day as I tend to suck on them not chew them, thus they last quite a while. The 5 pound box drops the price in half, making the price for 5 oz about $1.80. (Fortunately for easier storage, the chews come in one larger bag not individual 5 oz bags.) I have found if I have one when I get 'hungry' after dinner, it fills the dessert void and helps keep me out of the fridge and pantry. I just tuck in the side of my mouth and the flavor keeps my mind and mouth busy enough to keep my no eating after 8pm rule in check.

 not straightforward about allergen information,1,"My daughter is extremely sensitive to gluten so many products that promote themselves as gluten free prove to be otherwise when my daughter has a gluten reaction. For the sake of keeping my daughter healthy I contact companies asking them if they test for gluten and if gluten is processed in the same facility. If it is then it is almost certainly contaminated. Most companies give me a detailed and open answer so that I can make the best decision for my daughter. They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not. They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision. Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer. They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing. They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels. They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so. So Larabar is attempting to deceive me. They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars. Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful.

Coffee drinkers have very individual tastes, but for me and my wife this coffee is delicious. IMPORTANT: Carefully check the price before you order this coffee from any seller. A box of 24 cups should cost less than fourteen dollars exclusive of shipping, and further discounts are available if you order multiple boxes, including free shipping. …",61 out of 62 users found this review helpful
" Mix with the plain greek yogurt, So yummy!",5,"Just came out an idea about mixing Mio with plain yogurt. I added one squeeze into a 2lb of greek yogurt, stirred for a while. Taste just like the fruit flavor yogurt on the market. Has a creamy texture with less carbs and lots of protein. Yummy! It seems a little too sweet for me, so next time I'd add half squeeze and try. As a water flavorant, as far as I tried, I like this flavor and the fruit punch. The sweet tea and peach tea taste far less satisfactory than snapple or lipton brisk (my favorite brand). But after adding some lemon juice, those two taste better. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Not bad for the money!!,5,"I was pleasantly surprised by this kit.. I made it to the directions, but added 2 oak spirals (purchased seperately) during fermentation. For some reason, this wine took more time to ferment than the directions stated, which is why I always go by hydrometer readings and not the ""guidelines"" in the directions. This posed no problem for me as it gave the wine longer to extract flavor from the oak.. My kit took just over 6 weeks from yeast pitch to bottle. Fermentation alone took 4 weeks. This is also the only kit I ever made using tap water, so that ""may"" have affected fermentation.. All in all, this wine is a winner to me, and everyone who has tried it has given it a thumbs up. The oak gave it the soft buttery and vanilla flavors which I have always loved in a Chard.. If you are not a fan of oaky Chards, and decide to make this, please post your results without using oak. I am interested to see if the oak added significantly more character to this wine or not. For the money, I think this is a steal!! Especially since it comes with corks, shrink capsules and labels!!! I will definatley be ordering this kit regularly, and already have orders for more bottles!! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Still my favorite :-),5,"In my humble opinion these are the best cookies EVER. Although I suppose since half of it is marshmallow, ""cookie"" is a bit of a misnomer. What they are is a chocolate cake-like cookie topped with a ring of marshmallow and covered in chocolate. Pricey little buggers, but very worth it. If you are either overly attached to the traditional concept of a ""cookie"" (how boring...) or have a particular aversion to marshmallow (how do you not like marshmallows?????), perhaps Pinwheels are not for you. (Yay, more for the rest of us.) Word of warning: Nabisco only sells the real thing during the winter months when the chocolate won't melt during shipping. During the summer they replace Pinwheels with some nasty confection referred to as Twirls. They look just like Pinwheels but they are coated with brown, waxy, imitation chocolate and are best avoided. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
" Decent taste, but some definite drawbacks.",3,"Superstore doesn't list the ingredients of this, but it does contain lots of high fructose corn syrup and regular corn syrup. Corn syrup, especially the high fructose variety, is quite bad for you. It's cheap for manufacturers, that's partly why they use it. I'm disappointed in Heinz about his. Due to this, it has 4 grams of sugar per 1 Tbsp serving, double the sugar of another bottle of regular ketchup I have. Since most of us use at least 2 Tbsp per serving this is quite a bit of sugar. Second, this uses Potassium Chloride, the main ingredient of No Salt salt substitute. This can be fine for many people (used in moderation) but it is a strict no-no for people taking certain blood pressure medications, such as myself (I think many medications in the ACE-inhibitor family especially). I should have somehow found the ingredients list from Heinz itself (or somewhere on the net) before buying this. Maybe I tried, I forget. At any rate, for your convenience, here is the list of ingredients, in this exact order from the label: ""INGREDIENTS: TOMATOE CONCENTRATE MADE FROM RED RIPE TOMATOES, DISTILLED VINEGAR, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, *POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SPICE, ONION POWDER, GARLIC POWDER, NATURAL FLAVORING. * NOT IN REGULAR KETCHUP"" Interestingly, this did not come in a case, even though 9 is the minumum order. It came as loose bottles in a box. Also, there was a barcode/description label sticker over part of the manufacturer ingredients list and nutrition info label in the exact same place on each bottle. This was probably for internal Superstore purposes. I bit of a pain to peel back to read underneath, but you only really need to do this on one bottle anyway, so not that big of a deal. I hope this review is helpful. …",16 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Best chai you can ever get from a bag.,5,"I have just bought this tea yesterday and made a traditional ""chai"", as I normally do. I've used other brands and types of bagged chai tea before, and they were decent, but nothing like this. I absolutely love my chai to be extremely spicy, and this is it.

 Best Tasting Salt AND So Incredibly Good For You,5,"This is the best tasting salt I've ever had. I learned about this after starting a ""raw"" diet and I was obsessed about having everything raw. I'm a condiment queen and it was really hard for me to give up a lot of my condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo). I was never a salt user - I'm a self-described fresh pepper addict and connoisseur. However, once I realized this salt was raw, all natural and got great reviews, I decided to try it. This really does enhance almost every dish I eat. In addition, there are a ton of articles online explaining why this 200 million year old natural nutrient is so very good for us.

 Techno-BEST,5,"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek. There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine. The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup. This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion. It's easy to hold and get out of the machine. The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier. This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut. Ingenious.

 Every nursing mother should know about this!!!,5,"WOW!! I was doing just fine until my little one started hitting mini-growth spurts. I had been giving her a bottle of pumped milk twice a day when I had to take medicine that I didn't want in my system when I nursed. So, when I got off the medicine, I noticed that those times of day, I was not producing AT ALL. If you don't use it, you lose it, so they say. I was desperately nursing every hour just for my girl to get SOMETHING and stimulate production, but it didn't work and we were both frustrated and tired. I read about Fenugreek seed and couldn't find it, but stumbled upon this tea. Within 24 hours I was so engorged that I had to pump!! I now still use it just to be able to store up frozen milk for when my husband and I go out or I run an errand and don't want to have to find somewhere to nurse. My milk supply now doesn't even begin to run out when I use the pumped milk and skip nursing. I wish that I could tell every mom about this. I think less women would give up on nursing due to lack of milk, if they knew about this tea! And it's so inexpensive. I drink at least 2 cups a day. I love the taste. It's sweet and minty.

 So far so good.,4,"I purchased this from our local Staples, for about $40.00 less then what is listed here. The one feature of this I liked over the other one I had (can't remember the model #) is that it has a drain feature. The 6 oz setting isn't really needed in our house, we either use the 8oz or 10 oz. Also, it is louder then the other model. In reply to the other review about how it vibrated and made a VERY loud noise when priming, I experienced the same issue, I called the company about that, and what happens is, you have to lift up the reservoir (which is already filled with water) and set it back down. If it's not setting down just right, it can't siphon in the water, which causes that bad vibration and LOUD noise. It has a really heavy duty cord and just seems really heavy duty. I did see it is around $89.00 at the Keurig website, but saw that after I got this from Staples. If you have never owned a Keurig, just keep in mind then once you own one, you WILL be addicted, and, the k cups are pricey.

 They changed the Chips now they taste horrible,1,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy. I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan. About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket. I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it. After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to. They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed. So I e-mailed Kettle with the following: ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering."" I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag. This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks. Please let me know if I can be of any more help."" Well the next bag was good. Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost. I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company. So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle. Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand. increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand. Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same... …",20 out of 27 users found this review helpful

" High Promise, Less Delivery",2,"High Promise, Less Delivery I started growing tomatoes with my AeroGarden about two months ago. I got my first flower a few days ago, the first step towards tomatoes. Unfortunately, the pump on the device stopped working the next day. The FAQ on their web site advises me to open the device, take it apart, and clean the pump. They provide seven (7!) pages of instructions to follow and the process requires the use of a flat head screwdriver, small pliers, butter knife and soap. You also have to provide containers to put the liquid in and find a place for the plants that require their roots to be maintained under water. They claim the cleaning will take 20 to 25 minutes on the first attempt. It actually took about 15 minutes to complete, but then my pump was perfectly clean! The problem was not the pump, the problem was that the root system became so extensive after two months of growing, that the mass of roots blocked the pump intake located at the bottom of the tower. When your pump stops working, I suggest before you go to the bother of taking the pump apart, that you first try trimming the root system around the bottom of the pump tower. That is a MUCH EASER REPAIR compared to taking the whole thing apart. At any rate, I put everything back together, and the pump now works. I have several suggestions for AeroGarden management. Number one suggestion, do something about your NON RESPONSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Perhaps they answer the phone, but if you send them an email, don't expect a response. Its been one week since I sent them a question about the pump failure... no response to this date. Email communications is worthless with this company, so if you need help, call them. From what I have read about their phone customer service, you might want to have a few snacks at hand and use a speaker phone so you can do other things while you wait. Number two, I suggest that management learn a bit about a concept called ""Maintainability"". Its related to designing a product so its easy to maintain. Apparently the pump on these things need to be maintained. A little point that is not mentioned in the sales literature. Having to take the thing apart to get at the pump so you can clean the filter is silly and reflects a lack of design competence. It would be a cinch to design something better this. I hope potential competitors are listening. Number Three, add to your pump failure instructions the fact that the root system could be blocking the water intake at the bottom of the pump tower. If your pump stops working, the first thing you should do is to move the roots away from the bottom of the pump tower. You can trim the bottom of the roots with a scissor if you are careful. If that works, you have just saved yourself a lot of trouble that you did not need to go through. Number Four, the growth feeding tablets are hydroscopic. That means they attract water. Keeping them in the little plastic bag provided will, in time, result in their merging together into a large amorphous mass. Management should provide a more water vapor resistant plastic vile to keep the growth feeding tablets in. Of course, that might cost five cents, so its not likely going to happen. So at the minimum, I suggest that users of the thing supply the necessary vile. In Summary, we have an intriguing product, where little attention has been devoted to maintenance design. We have incomplete instructions with respect to trouble shooting in the event the pump stops working. We have non responsive customer service, so if you do have a problem, and you expect to save your current plants, you are pretty much on your own. By the way, why is this thing called an ""Aero"" garden? Its a hydroponics garden so it would seem that ""Aqua"" or ""Hydro"" or ""H2O"" garden would be a more appropriate name. Would I recommend it? I bought the device because I wanted to learn more about hydroponics gardening. I expected little, so my expectations were met. Its a thought provoking gadget, but given all of the faults in conjunction with non responsive customer support, I have to rate it more in the un-met promise category... that's two stars. I can't justify higher ratings when you have a company that provides customer service at this level of ineptitude. Additional Info as of August 2008 I have tried an additional Cherry tomato crop (see my review of the cherry tomato seed kit). Based on Superstore seed kit reviews, it appears that about 70% of the tomato seed kit reviews are negative. So its not just me. My second batch of tomato's consists of a few marble sized yellow tomatoes, and NO red tomatoes. I am out of nutrients, and I am not going to pay AeroGrows inflated price for more nutrients. I suggest that the cherry tomato kits have a limited shelf life and that AeroGrow is ignoring that. What else can explain 70% negative reviews under controlled growing conditions? Save your money and don't bother with the Cherry tomatos unless you are willing to throw the dice. I am going to try an herb kit next. If it does not do better, I will probably take the thing apart and redesign it correctly. …",24 out of 28 users found this review helpful

 Very good!,5,"I admit it, I'm a tea snob. Tea isn't a beverage for me, it's an event, starting from boiling the water to when the last drop vanishes down my oesophagus. And as a snob, I don't buy bagged teas, I buy loose leaf. So I normally wouldn't have drank this tea, except that I filched a couple of complimentary bags while waiting interminably at the local dealership (OK, I drank one at the dealership and stole 3, one for each hour I was kept waiting). On the matter of taste, I find it very good. The Bigelow EG appeared to be very strong in color and taste. Tea bag teas are usually cut very fine so the tea bags can be packed flat, and because finely cut leaves have more surface area than big leaves, you don't need to steep the tea as long. In fact the instructions say to steep only 1-2 minutes as opposed to the usual 3-4 mins. To me, Earl Grey taste has two components, the tea taste and the bergamot taste, and it takes a lot of skill to blend and make a tea that has a pleasing combination of the two tastes. Taylors and Harrogate has a mild tea and bergamot taste. Whole Foods loose leaf has a strong bergamot taste. Your run of the mill EG usually has a strong tea taste that overshadows the bergamot and you don't taste it at all. Bigelow has a very strong tea taste, but it doesn't overwhelm the bergamot, which you taste at the end. So I like it very much, because I've never had a strong tea that didn't overwhelm the bergamot. And it's definitely not a mild tea, it's very robust and strong. It's not a light handshake, it's a full body hug and kisses on both cheeks when you drink this. In conclusion, if you want a very strongly flavored Earl Grey with a strong tea taste, but also a strong hint of bergamot, this is it, I'll definitely buy some (because I think they have security cameras in the waiting area). …",30 out of 32 users found this review helpful
 Placebo?  I don't think so!!  IT WORKS!!!!,5,"This product was recommended to me by a few nurses & lactation consultants. I wasn't going to get as I'm not much of a ""wholistic medicine"" person and read that fenugreek products are more of a placebo type of drug. That is, as a placebo, the benefit of the drug is a mental / emotional one not a proven factual/medical one. I have to disagree & highly recommend this product. I have numerous issues against me in the breastfeeding department... I'm an older mom, I have thyroid issues, had fertility issues and my child was not accomodating to breastfeeding. For a few weeks, and per the advice of a few professionals, I was doing an insane ""booby boot camp"" to increase my supply. I was attempting to do this at EACH feeding: breast feed for 10-15 minutes per side, bottle feed with a formula supplement, and then pump for 20 minutes. Doing this took a minimum of 2 hours and was done at every 3 hour increment. Insane!!! My child also would not breast feed unless I used a nipple shield as well. I believe that all this was caused when I was in the hospital, she wouldn't feed well and the hospital 1) got her hooked to the nipple shield, 2) got her started down the bottle / formula route since she was a tiny baby, and 3) NEGLECTED TO TELL ME that I needed to pump to keep my supply up. The combo of the events was a powerfully negative effect on my milk supply, breastfeeding abililty, and well being. Needless to say, I was a physical and emotional wreck, but I was willing to do the booby boot camp to try to increase my milk supply and ultimately exclusively breastfeed my baby. So here's the point: After drinking the tea ONE time, I had immediate results. My pumping supply increased about 3x. Now, my supply is fine. Even better, I'm no longer on booby boot camp and not providing supplement of formula OR expressed breast milk to my daughter. Next stage is getting her off the nipple shield, but everything is in phases. Plus, it's now some crazy early hour, I really should be sleeping, but I wanted to leave feedback so others don't suffer like I did. For what it's worth, I also recommend Dr. Harvey Karp's book ""Happiest Baby on the Block"". The calming recommendations have been a life saver for me. Did I mention that my husband travels for work and is gone unpredictibly for days at a time? Oh, and we moved when I was 8 months pregnant. TRUST ME: The book & the tea have been hugely helpful.

 Love this product,5,"Our 10 year old lab mix started having problemswith his hip joints. He has always been an active dog and watching him lay around and not want to interact was hard to see. Initially our vet gave us Rimadyl to get him through the acute phase, but it is a bit pricey and I know that it is hard on their stomach and kidneys. I searched the internet and read reviews for several days, each time my reasearch led me back to this product. Off I went to the local pet supply store to get this treat. When I opened the bag I thought for sure that my dog would turn his nose up at them, they smell awful....well my husband now calls these ""doggie crack"", our dog LOVES these treats. As soon as he sees the bag he RUNS to get his snack. Yep RUNS. Not only am I giving him something he loves but something that has helped him with mobility. I followed directions I found at a vets website to double the dose for several weeks and then give a maintenance dose of glucosamine after that....what a difference!!! Shop around as I only purchase these at the local store if I make a mistake and run out! There is quite a difference in price from stores to online. I am completely sold on this product and have now started purchasing some of their other treats and products as well!! Can't go wrong with Zukes! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Amateurish Repackaging And Apparent Recycling: Slightly Distasteful And Not Gift Quality,1,"Quite literally, I have never seen anything like this gift basket construction from Back Mountain Baskets represented here by the igourmet label. And unfortunately, I don't mean that in a positive way. As someone who frequently purchases gift baskets (I average four to six a year and at one time procured hundreds as corporate gifts), I was extremely dissatisfied with this item. When you purchase a gift basket, two things are relatively certain: 1) you're going to overpay for what's actually included, and (2) at least you're going to get something presentable and of gift quality. Heck, these are even advertised as gourmet items! Only a couple of items might actually qualify as exotic or gourmet. At a $49.99 list price, there is maybe $20 worth of small snacks, most of which could be replicated at your local convenience store. If I had made a gift basket at home, it would have been classier and more tasteful than the horribly amateurish efforts made by this company. I won't even discuss the quality of the items included in the basket which I actually have some serious reservations about. This basket is NOT something that you would (or should) pay to have a professional company assemble due to packaging. Many of the included items are stuffed into boxes and wrapped rather cheaply with handmade labels. Okay, not a very deluxe or fancy presentation. But what's worse (and frankly unforgivable) is that the boxes used are not plain white gift boxes or something else presentable--no, they are emptied trash from other products re-purposed. Do you want your elegant food items (again I'm being generous with the item quality) in old cracker boxes glued back together? Just whose recycling bin have they been raiding? It's rather distasteful. Here are a few examples of what I'm talking about--first is the empty box used and in parenthesis is the actual item inside: Keebler Club Cracker Box (pretzels) Stauffer's Animal Cracker Box (other cookies) Crystal Light Fruit Punch Box (candies) Nabisco Wheat Thins Box (popcorn) Jello Gelatin Box (cookies) These are but a few examples of boxes used to repackage other items. I got two of these baskets and they were both constructed in a similar manner. Seriously. If you paid to have an elegant gift basket, would you expect to find loose candies glued into a Crystal Light box? As I said, there isn't even the common sense and taste level to use plain white boxes. It would be an embarrassment to send this as a gift item. Due to the packaging, I even threw a number of items straight into the trash as I was not confident of their handling due to the obvious lack of professional standards. A huge disappointment and very unappetizing all around. KGHarris, 10/11. …",26 out of 34 users found this review helpful

 Good value for what it is,5,"My wife and I wanted to get a gift basket like this for her father for Christmas. We weren't going to be able to visit in person this year and enjoy Christmas morning breakfast and thought a gift basket would be nice. After researching tons of options I became frustrated that so often the shipping on products like this cost more than the actual products themselves. Let's face it, a pre-arranged gift basket of food is rarely going to be a ""value"". But when you add in shipping these things can be down right outrageous. We came across this basket and it was available with Superstore Prime free shipping. Not only that, it was less expensive than other alternatives we were looking at (some from other non-Superstore vendors). We went ahead and ordered this. It arrived exactly on time in excellent condition and, according to my father-in-law, it was excellent. I have no complaints and was happy to find this option. I was pleased with the company and Superstore. Hopefully it remains ""prime-eligible"" in the future. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Great cereal but WAY overpriced...,5,"I love this cereal and I eat it regularly, but at $20 for 4 boxes, you're paying $5 a box, which is outrageous.

 Product has Alfalfa... which can be  VERY HARMFUL!,1,"Please be aware that these bars have ALFALFA that can cause DNA mutation from a component called L-canavanine( this is an analog of an amino-acid that 'tricks' your body into forming dis-functional DNA!). When studied in monkeys (they will not dare study this in people, even though there have been many case reports), ALFALFA has induced Lupus.I am vigilant to to beware these natural companies put questionable ingredients in their products! Alfalfa grass is in the bars and powder of this Amazing Grass product. I did purchase this product and did not realize it contained alfalfa until after I received it. L-canavanine(found in alfalfa seeds and also to a lesser degree in leafs) is a plant insectiside. L-canavanine occurs as a toxic non-protein amino acid in Alfalfa. The seeds have the highest amount of L-canavanine ; the grass also contains this product. There are other plants that contain L-canavanine but are not common- Alfalfa is the most studied in this area. See the Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL - published in Autommun Rev. 2006 Jul;5(6):429-35. Epub 2005 Dec 29. has found: ""One mechanism of its toxicity is its incorporation into proteins, replacing L-arginine and giving rise to functionally aberrant polypeptides. Association of SLE and alfalfa was first reported in a volunteer who developed lupus-like autoimmunity while ingesting alfalfa seed for a hypercholesterolemia study. This was corroborated with studies in monkeys fed with alfalfa sprout that developed SLE. Re-challenge with L-canavanine relapsed the disease. Arginine homologue L-canavanine, present in alfalfa, was suspected as a cause. L-canavanine can be charged by arginyl tRNA synthetase to replace L-arginine during protein synthesis. Aberrant canavanyl proteins have disrupted structure and functions. Induction or exacerbation of SLE by alfalfa tablets reported in a few cases remains controversial. Epidemiological studies on the relationship between alfalfa and SLE are sparse. In mice, NZB/W F1, NZB, and DBA/2 mice fed with L-canavanine show exacerbation/triggering of the SLE, however, BALB/c studies were negative. L-canavanine incorporation may be more efficient in the presence of inflammation or other conditions that can cause arginine deficiency. The L-canavanine induced apoptotic cells can be phagocytosed and a source of autoantigens processed by endosomal proteases. Endogenous canavanyl proteins are ubiquitinated and processed via proteasome. Incorporation of L-canavanine into proteasome or endosome can also cause disruption of antigen processing. Alfalfa/L-canavanine-induced lupus will be an interesting model of autoimmunity induced by the modification of self-proteins at the translational level."" Please be careful with this product. There are many other ""green foods products"" that avoid the use of Alfalfa seeds or grass for this reason. Other research all accessible by public at Pubmed (among many): Prete PE. The mechanism of action of L-canavanine in inducing autoimmune phenomena. Arthritis Rheum. 1985;28(10):1198-1200. Rajkowski KT. Simplified Qualitative Method for Canavanine in Seeds and Sprouts.

 If You Like a Stong Brew,5,"I am the buyer for a 20-person department. The folks who like a bold strong coffee love this one. I like it as well, but I use the 10-oz setting when I make it instead of my typical 8-oz. ""Fogchaser"" sums it up pretty well. This will clear your head and get you ready to roll. I also love that there is less packaging. I must admit to a bit of guilt over the whole K-Cup disposal situation. (I make people use china coffee cups and am happy to wash them!) These do not have the plastic outer cup. I keep them in a plastic container with a sealed lid instead of in the K-Cup carousel to keep them fresher. But I gotta tell you--opening that lid yields the most wonderful coffee aroma. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Canned Tuna,4,"This is not your average canned tuna at $10.00 a tin, but if you are looking for a gourmet canned tuna experience this is it. I have seen the same product in Michigan for $17.99 a tin, so $9.99 is quite the bargain. I made a simple butter lettuce salad, flaked the tuna on top, reserving the olive oil in the tin for the dressing of sea salt, ground pepper, lemon juice and a couple of capers. It got rave reviews. Ortiz has different grades and Superstore has the best prices, try one of each in a side by side comparison, include a can of the best tuna you can find in your local grocery store then decide for yourself. On a side note, has anyone noticed that Superstore's prices are better that eBay prices? …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful
" Useful especially if you have a small kitchen, one safety concern though",3,"I live in a small apartment and don't have room for lots of gadgets (not even a microwave). I find this appliance to be worth the counter space. I like that you can steam and puree in one appliance, and that I don't have to lug out the steamer and blender to whip up some food. Some reviewers say your baby will outgrow this machine's usefulness in a few months but I disagree. My baby eats mostly finger foods but still I use the Beaba a lot. I use it to reheat leftovers (again, we have no microwave) and also use it to chop or puree adult dinners that are two hard for baby to eat. It's not a huge capacity but that doesn't bother me. After spending whole weekends steaming, blending and freezing veggies, just to discover that my kid's taste buds changed and what he once loved he now refuses, I'm over large scale baby food production. One safety note! There is a little hole that the lid clicks into. That hole leads to the water chamber and I once accidentally tipped the machine over and scalding hot water came out of the hole and landed on my hand. I got a nasty burn. Definitely keep this machine well away from the edge of counters! …",303 out of 307 users found this review helpful

 Tasty and free of nasty fake sugars,5,"This gum is old school. It doesn't believe in all those fancy, new fangled sugar alternatives. Ingredients are simple: cane sugar, glucose, gum base, rice syrup, beeswax, carnuba wax and flavors. It also doesn't mess around with synthetic color agents (no Red #40 or Yellow #5 lurking in these boxes). Bonus is that it tastes great. No it doesn't stay flavorful for an extra, extra, extra long time, but its delicious for long enough to get a nice minty taste in my mouth and satisfy my desire to chew. I had discovered Glee Gum years ago and enjoyed it, but hadn't thought much about it again until I became pregnant last year and realized EVER gum at the corner store or gas station had either aspartame or saccharine in it. Even the tried and true Juicy Fruit has turned to the dark side. Thank you Glee Gum for offering this delicious, all natural alternative to the neuro-toxin laced sticks sold by your competitors.

 These Oats are Not For Sowing...,5,"They're for eating, of course (ok, maybe if you're an oat farmer, you have a different persepctive.) At any rate, rather than argue the relative virtues of rolled vs. steel cut oat cereals, I sing the praises of both. Maybe it's a seasonal thing, the somewhat coarser, nuttier, rougher steel cuts somehow more fitting to cold winters than are the mellower and softer rolled oats. It's like black coffee to an au lait, dark beer to light, hard bebop to cool jazz...you get the picture. You'll also feel virtuous spending some old-fashioned time over the stove (albeit not that much, or that arduous). The warming experience is itself sufficient, you'll feel like mending a fence somewhere (or tearing it down if in a RObert Frost frame of mind), but it's common to top this with contrasting fruit, or perhaps nuts, syrups, flax seed oil, brown sugar, yoghurt, raisins, prunes, lat night's stew?--it's HEARTY enough to stand up to almost anything you can throw at it.

" Great product, packaging can be improved",5,"No question, this is an effective product. Using pheramones [sic.] to attact moths then trap them with sticky paper appeal to my love of science and technology. Today, the product is already folded into a triangular house for the moths to fly into. The interior is coated with adhesive so the moths become trapped after entering the house. Users must removed a pheramone-infused tab from a sealed package, then insert the tab into a slot to get it inside the housing. But almost always, the tab falls out of its intended spot and is stuck to the interior. I've used it this way and it seems to work fine, but the manufactuer can help users by making three changes in the way they package the product. 1. make the little pheramone-infused tab already correctly positioned and attached to the interior so that users don't have to open the sealed package and handle the tab. 2. They should cover the whole item, including the sticky paper, with wax paper, score where the folds go, and indicate how to fold it into the housing shape. Then users would just have to peel the whole wax sheet off to expose the sticky paper and the pheramone tab, fold it up, and voila, done! This way, the manufacturer can also save on packaging by shipping the items in a flat envelope rather than a mostly empty box. 3. Make the sticky housing attachable to something so it doesn't knock around my pantry. This can be as simple as a hole to hang it on a nail, or a weak adhesive like that used on Post-it notes to attach the trap to a wall. …",38 out of 43 users found this review helpful
