 Convenient to use and store,5,"The description may be a little unclear, so just to clarify, you are getting 12 boxes, each box has 3 packets, so a total of 36 packets. Each packet makes 1Qt of milk. Those of you that have purchased powdered milk before will see how convenient this this. To get powdered for a reasonable price at the store, you need to buy the biggest box they have. The problem there is that as soon as you open it, you need to find better containers to store it in, preferably air tight and not made of plastic. The smaller packets you get with this product remove the need to find secondary storage containers. Because you don't have to open it all at once, you don't have to worry about the moisture making the milk go bad, or light reducing the vitamin quality. If you have never used powdered milk before, there are some nice benefits. The main benefit to me is that it doesn't go bad. I don't drink enough milk to justify buying it by the gallon, and even buying half gallon sizes it would go bad before I could use it. With powdered milk I never have to worry about it going bad, nor do I need to wonder if I have milk on hand. Now, as for taste, I don't drink milk by itself, powdered or not. I've read that if you do, it's best to mix it up and then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. I use it in protein shakes, where it tastes no different than regular milk. I imagine it would be great for things like smoothies as well. Another great use for powdered milk is adding it to coffee. Much healthier for you than powdered non-dairy creamer, and just as creamy and delicious. And, unlike regular milk, the powdered milk will not cool down your coffee nearly as much. I've gotten a few people hooked on using powdered milk in their coffee. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 This stuff is great,5,"I've used this to combine all types of wild game and form it into delicious edible steaks. It works best to marinade your wild game first to have the flavors evenly dispersed throughout the meat. Do this overnight in the fridge, then simply mix the meat with the glue, wrap into a tube in plastic wrap. Wait a while and cut into tasty steaks. You can even freeze the tube and cut into steaks later. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! …",16 out of 21 users found this review helpful
" Delightful, crunchy and um....gone.",4,"Freeze dried fruit is expensive, since many fruits are about 90% water, and strawberries are no exception. This little 1/2 lb container was made with 5 lbs of fruit. The flavor is very concentrated, as was the price. Most people couldn't down 5 lbs of strawberries in a few minutes, but downing these little treats is something else again. I'd look at them as healthy candy alternative. it contains the same vitamins, materials, fiber and nutrients as 5 lb. of strawcerries but it also has the sugar and calories as 5 lbs of fruit, too. They're awfully yummy, so try not to get too addicted to them. …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 I Should Have Never Tried It ... Too Late Now,5,"I was wandering around the international food aisle when this caught my eye. Sweetened, condensed milk in a re-sealable bottle rather than a tin can. I said, ""Oh my! What evil thing is this?"" And then I bought it. You might not be able to use a whole can of sweetened, condensed milk, but you sure can find lots of uses for a it when it comes in a squeeze bottle. I put it in my coffee, in my tea, over my fruit, over my icecream, and then I lick the plate. The really nice thing about this container is that you can turn it upside down so that the nice, cool, sweet goo that is La Lechera is ready to pour whenever you want it. Don't buy this unless you want a new addiction. Seriously. …",56 out of 56 users found this review helpful
 Perfect for Seitan,5,"Bob's Red Mill Gluten Flour is perfect for making seitan. Your success will depend on the recipe that you use. An online search for ""seitan recipes"" will net you several, including videos showing the steps to success. Here is my Chicken-ish Seitan Patties recipe. Chicken-ish Seitan Patties Dry Ingredients: 1 cup gluten flour 2 TBS garbanzo bean flour 2 TBS nutritional yeast 1/4 tsp thyme 1/2 tsp rosemary 1 tsp sage 1/2 tsp marjoram 1 tsp onion powder Pepper to taste Wet ingredients: 2 TBS cashew butter 2 Edward & Sons Not-Chick'n Bouillon Cubes 1 +/- cup cold water Mix all of the dry ingredients and set aside. I used 4 turns of the pepper mill. I grind the rosemary and thyme with a pestle in a mortar before adding to the dry ingredients. Mix all of the wet ingredients. I put all of the wet ingredients into a personal blender and mixed it up. Add the blended wet ingredients to the dry and mix well. If necessary, add additional water. If the mixture is a bit sloshy at this point, you've added too much water. This can be fixed with the addition of a tiny bit of gluten. I also let the mixture set for a couple of minutes to let the water be absorbed. Measure out some aluminum foil squares approximately 8 inches wide. Measure out a heaping 1/4 cup of the mixture onto the middle of your foil. Pat the mixture down into a patty, then fold the aluminum foil making a tight pouch. Continue until all of the gluten mixture is used up. I believe that I got 6 patties out of the mixture. Place packets into a steamer and steam over boiling water for approximately 35 minutes. Remove from heat. The patties can be used at this point however you wish. Possible changes: Tahini can be used in place of the cashew butter. Obviously any kind of chicken bullion can be used. …",43 out of 44 users found this review helpful
 A Morning Staple,5,"Fantastic, fresh and flavorful...this is a morning staple in my household and always at an affordable price. Update: Unfortunately, in a move similar to gas prices, the price of the 4-pack original whole bean blend has increased more than $10.00 from a few months ago (it is now $26.78 with subscribe and save). This excellent coffee is no longer affordable. Why the substantial increase when other Eight O'Clock beans are still at the $15.53 subscribe and save price? …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" Jamaica Blue Mountain, the very best.",4,"If you are only starting your trek into the world of serious coffee appreciation, then I highly suggest you, without haste, purchase one pound at least of whole bean JBM. Also a good grinder, a temperature controlled machine and a decent water filtration system. Pre-ground takes much of the flavor away, compaired to properly done fresh home ground coffee, and coffee is lessened without being prepaired at the correct temperature of filtered water. But why something so expensive? Why jump in to the deep end of the pool before even getting your feet wet? Some may scoff, saying that only a true coffee fanatic would understand or be able to appreciate this blend. That is entirely true. But how can anyone really understand without first having tasted the standard by which all others must be judged? Thus why this review is only four out of five stars. You see, JBM is so subtle, so complex, that a new tounge will not notice what makes JBM quite so wonderful. It is a ""perfectly"" blended coffee. Flavor, bitterness, acidity and aftertaste. On a scale of one to ten, they all rank dead even at five. Every other coffee is like a exaggeration of this hard to get bean. This should be the first coffee to ever cross the lips of anyone who wants to learn these things. How else can you truely understand the other blends? …",15 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 An Excellent and Healthy Choice for Anyone's Diet,5,"A quality product from Bio-familia, a Swedish company that developed ""Bircherm&uuml;esli"" a product so popular and successful that made the name Muesli famous all over the world. If you need a high fiber and protein snack option for your diet, this is absolutely a very good product. You can't go wrong and the best of all: excellent taste and quality, and for a pack of five this comes at a good value. The Strawberries and Rasberries included in this version of the cereal at Anti-oxidants to the mixture, making a good product even better. Sometimes your diet will require you eat frequently and consciously, and in those cases you need to have a snack at hand when you get hungry, in order to keep your metabolism high all day long. In such cases finding a good and balance option could be hard. I love this 5-pack and I always have one at home an another pack at the office. I try to eat five or more times a day, so in my case having a healthy snack at hand wherever I am when I get hungry is a priority. Since you are checking this product I have to guess that you are probably a person that cares about what you eat, either because you are interested in losing weight, getting in better shape or just be healthier and keep in good shape, so I will share my own experience in the weight loss game and staying in shape game My own successful personal experience in weight loss is based on strategies to boost metabolism. Don't stress yourself, eat frequently, eat just what you need each time, and choose wisely what you are going to eat, supplement your diet. Yet simple and it works. I loss more than 200 lbs and shrink my waist (from 44 to 32), and I have been able to keep in good shape since then. Every single aspect of my life has improved since then. Keep in mind that a good diet is just part of the equation, you also need a plan that helps you keep on track and monitor your condition. Based on my own personal experience I can recommend some tools that you may want to consider, to establish your own strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off. They are: - ""Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss"" by Mark Hyman. A practical an realistic plan for weigh loss. - ""The ABS Diet"", which is another very practical, readable, insightful, and inspirational book, that also includes an exercise plan. - A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism). - A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism). - ""Heart Monitor Training for the Complete Idiot"", a primer on the use of Heart Rate Monitors for health improvement or weight control. If you want to star focusing only on your diet, the first two may be worth considering. If you exercise, or want to start doing it right, the last threee are for you. If you do both, all the recommended options can improve your results. I am 39 years old, With the help of the tools I just mentioned not only I went fro size 44 to size 32 pants, but also obtained substantial benefits that included weight control, cardiovascular improvements, lowered blood pressure, and improved muscular-skeletal strength and flexibility, but also the myriad of mental and psychological benefits derived from being in the best shape of my life. …",6 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Madras Lentils a good side dish,5,"I've been eating various Indian retorted veggie entrees for a while now -- we use them as side dishes when I cook main dishes that may be, but aren't always, Indian. The Madras Lentils remind me a lot of really good Louisiana Red Beans (as in Red Beans & Rice--with or without sausage). Very flavorful and actually a bit meaty in taste. I first encountered them at Trader Joe's but it seems that they are going over to their own labels and they wouldn't admit that they were using TastyBite (see someone else's review of Punjabi Eggplant)so I'll stick with the original.

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 FANTASTIC... Closest to Peanut Butter Taste,5,"I have tried many brands of almond butter because I can not eat peanuts. I ordered some of this from Superstore(great service btw) and i was a little concerned when i opened it because it looked almost like peanut butter. I called the company directly in California. They put the plant manager on the phone to answer my questions. I asked him why it was a different color than i was used to.(most almond butters are sort of grayish). He told me that they don't grind the skins with the almonds. Also the top grade of palm fruit oil that they use is high in cartenoids and helps to keep this product stable (not rancid) and adds to the color. Also they process this product to keep it as natural and roasted flavor filled as possible. I was impressed with the manager, the product and the company. Google the company history and learn about Jennifer Barney. [...] What can I say this is the BEST TASTING almond butter out there In my opinion. …",46 out of 47 users found this review helpful

 Herdez chipotles beat all others,5,"Canned chipotles are smoked, pickled jalapeno chiles. Different brands taste slightly different because each company uses its own pickling mixture. Herdez chipotles taste distinctly better than the more commonly found Embasa or La Costena brands. The Herdez brand is worth seeking out- their salsas are good too. The easiest way to use canned chipotles is to puree the entire can and transfer the puree to a jar. You can then add smaller quantities of the puree to your recipes- soups, dips, sauces, spice rubs for grilling, etc. Drizzle a thin layer of oil on top of remaining puree, and keep the jar in your refridgerator. It should keep for a few weeks. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
" ""Better than meat!"" says the carnivore.",5,"I am a card-carrying carnivore. Having said that, I am also the Laziest Man This Side of a Lebowski. Even chewing is too much work for me. Given that, Primal Strips are heaven. The texture is very close to meat, but is consistently chewable, with none of the gristle often associated with beef jerky. Spam is too gooey. Real beef jerky makes my jaw ache, and I end up spitting out gristle too frequently. But this? This is perfect. If ""they"" replaced meat with this Soylent Brown-type food, I'd happily leave the Real Thing behind. I'm not sure of the health benefits. I guess it's good for me.

 Crunchy and ~delicious~!,5,"What is wrong with me? I ~love~ Product 19! Not because it is healthy (for cold cereal), but because it tastes great and keeps its crunch. How can Special K, which turns to mush on contact with milk, be so much more popular? How can it be that even some ""fans"" in these reviews take shots at the taste of Product 19? My love for this cereal may be slightly eccentric, but I do not rave about it from the perspective of especially favoring aggressively ""natural"" foods that are full of bran or whatever. True, I hate Wonder Bread and other foods that have been processed beyond all recognition. But I definitely do not favor twigs and berries. It seems to me that half the world is willing to give up brownies in favor of granola bars (I definitely am not), and yet people bash this great-tasting cereal as though it were cod liver oil. But I cry out to you from the wilderness! Give this stuff a try! It's delicious. 8/22/09 - Gosh...we seem almost like a cult, we fans of P19. I remember when it was introduced and believe its low sales were caused by marketing ineptness.

 This stuff is NASTY,1,"Superstore should have given the option of NO rating, because that is how badly I feel about this product. This product has been tasted with several brewing iterations and were hoping that we were just not brewing the grounds correctly. My family have been to Hawaii, had Kona, and fell in love with it. We certainly are not coffee snobs, but this is absolutely the worst coffee we've ever tasted. Not sure if this was even Kona. There was absolutely no nutty Kona fragrance to this coffee after brewing. This stuff is just plain nasty in taste. I've had stale coffee before and it was better than this. When I purchased it I couldn't wait to get hold of it and have some. This was one of the most disappointing products purchased.

 Some important issues,3,"This product is as described. Here are some issue I had with the installation. The wire used is aluminum wire. If you need additional wire, you need to match the same type of wire to prevent a galvanic reaction which could cause corrosion and a bad connection. The plastic poles are very flimsy. If your fence will be a straight line, you will need to support the end posts. If your fence will be enclosing something, you will need to support the poles wherever there is a turn in the fence. The cord is quite short. I had to use an extension cord for my application. Additionally, there are no insulated wires provided. If you need insulated wiring from the unit to the fence, you will need to provide that yourself. The poles are also pretty short. I got this to keep cats away from the aviary. If the cats figure out that they can simply jump over the fence, I'll have to change the setup. There is a newer model available. I have not seen one personally, but some of the issues seem to have been resolved with it. For example, the wiring included is galvanized wire instead of aluminum. That is easier to find than aluminum wire should you need more. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Lasso some Tabasco instead!,2,"Texas Pete's is the #1 hot sauce in the South - it's ubiquitous in every type of restaurant. If you ask for Tabasco, you're likely to get Texas Pete's hot sauce instead. The company was founded in 1929 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; their first product was their barbecue sauce, but the hot sauce soon followed. This is a basic hot sauce - peppers, vinegar, and salt - and it can be used as you would Tabasco or a Louisiana hot sauce. Unfortunately, it's extremely mild. I often find that, in order to add the desired heat to food, I have to add so much that the food becomes watery. My scrambled eggs end up a mess and still taste bland. If you like a mild hot sauce, then Texas Pete should be one of your top choices. Otherwise, avoid this wimpy selection.

 great food,5,My dog and foster dogs have done well on this food. It is the best priced quality grain free food there is to my knowledge. Superstore's price beats my local stores (including Petco when you factor in the sales tax I pay when I buy in the store). As an Superstore prime customer I was thrilled to see this included in free 2 day shipping- absolutely can't beat this deal! Superstore shipped it in a cardboard box about the same size as the bag and it arrived with the box looking quite the worse for wear. Since Wellness comes in a Mylar bag the bag itself was fine and I was home so brought it right in. If you were not going to be home when this was delivered and your deliveries are left outside I would be concerned about other animals getting to it. Even with the Mylar bag my dog can rip into this in no time flat and racoons and rats (I live next to a wooded area!) love dog food! Probably not a big deal mid-day but just something to consider. I would not buy food that ships in a paper bag from Superstore- at least not a larger bag (>15lbs) but that is just my experience/opinion. I am thrilled that Superstore offers this and would order again from them but will make sure I am home when it is to be delivered. …,16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Excellent Source Of Omega3 And Many Health Benefits,5,"I'm so glad to have found this product on Superstore. I have been using flax seed for 12 years. I was grinding my own in a coffee grinder. Then I found Spectrum Cold Milled Organic Ground Premium Flaxseed. I sprinkle a tablespoon full on my morning oatmeal every day. When I make smoothies, I add a tablespoon or two to my blender. My husband has recently started adding flaxseed to his oatmeal because he takes pain meds which are constipating. Flaxseeds help with constipation as they provide an excellent source of fiber. Flaxseeds can be added to many foods. They have a very slight nutty flavor if you taste it out of the bag. Personally, I cannot taste them at all when I add them to food. I love the convenience of having my flaxseeds ready to add to my food without having to drag out the grinder and clean it afterward. I keep my flaxseed in the freezer and use it directly from there. Omega3 oils are prone to becoming rancid and should be stored in the refrigerator or freezer once opened. I love the fact that these flaxseeds are organic. I also love that these flaxseeds are cold milled, which means they are not exposed to heat which would promote rancidity and destroy the nutritive value. I have read grinding your own flaxseeds subject the seeds to more heat than seeds which are commercially cold milled.I should add that my HDL cholesterol is double the norm. HDL is the good cholesterol. Most people average 40. My HDL is 86. Flaxseeds are the highest vegetarian source of Omega3 essential fatty acids and are attributed to many health benefits including heart health, diabetes, cancer, inflammation, pms, menopause and constipation.

AMBROSIA!,5,"After reading several of Bruce Fife's books (and they were wonderfully easy-to-read for the non-scientific type), I decided to give coconut oil a try to help with losing weight and getting my blood sugar under control. As a non-medication taking, recently diagnosed diabetic, I want to try whatever natural remedies I can find to stay off insulin and other diabetes meds, in addition to meds for cholesterol, etc. I tried taking a teaspoon or two with meals and a teaspoon btw meals and my blood sugar numbers were noticeably lower the same day. (Fife says the suggested dose is 3-4 tbs/day). The taste of this brand is fantastic, light and creamy with a delicious coconutty taste! I love coconut so I was able to eat it right from the jar, but I also tried it spread on a Wasa Crisp bread--WOW, what an easy way to get MCFAs into your diet! I will definitely be using this instead of any oils for all my cooking needs (except a little EVOO mixed together with this for salad dressing.) Also, I'm using on my skin and it feels really soft, plus you also get the internal benefits from using it on your skin! GREAT PRODUCT! …",406 out of 415 users found this review helpful

 Pretty good,3,"I purchased this today, and promptly fired off a batch of popcorn with 1/4 tsp. of this stuff added to the popping oil. The flavor is movie theater-ish, but I still feel like I'm missing the full effect because I'm not popping in coconut oil. Still, this stuff delivered some of the flavor I was looking for, and adhered to the popcorn just fine because I didn't use it as a sprinkling salt after the popping process was finished.

 NOT sugar free!,4,"Product description says ""Mousse Mixes that are smooth, rich, creamy and sugar-free!"" There are actually 4g of sugar per serving. This package contains 2 envelopes and each envelope supposedly has 4 servings. So if you eat one package, that's 16g of sugar that you're consuming. Here are the nutrition facts from the box: Total Fat 1.5g Saturated Fat 1g Trans Fat 0g -- but how does that add up to 1.5g of total fat??

I had my son on the powder and he would arch and pull away after two ounces (his twin sister could take about 5-6 ounces at this point and his weight was much less than hers). I switched to the liquid and he sucked it down like he hadn't eaten in months. It's very expensive but totally worth it in our circumstance!

" THIS IS NOT ""UMF"" MANUKA HONEY",5,"*****Update 11/17/10****** When I created this review, the product being sold was HNZ Honey New Zealand Active 20+ honey. This product listing has been changed to an unknown brand.***** This quote is taken from the HNZ website Q & A regarding the difference between ""UMF"" and ""ACTIVE"" Manuka. I don't know who posted the ""Product Description"" for this product, but it is wrong and falsely leading consumers to purchase something they think is UMF. I am not discrediting the Active 20+ Manuka honey from HNZ. It may be just as healthy as UMF 20+. I have the Active 30+ and it tastes amazing, like caramel. In fact, the Active honey HNZ sells is the best honey I have ever tasted. """"What is the difference between `UMF' & `Active' Manuka Honey? Not all Manuka honey has UMF (Non peroxide) activity and we differentiate this by using the names UMF Manuka and Active Manuka Honey. UMF Manuka Honey guarantees a Non Peroxide activity that is based on the UMF testing regime initiated by Prof. Molan. This in turn is measured against a standard Phenol (antiseptic/anti bacterial) solution to gauge the relative strength of the Non Peroxide activity against Phenol. So, UMF 20+ guarantees antibacterial Non Peroxide Activity (UMF) level of 20+. For example, Honey New Zealand's Active 20+ honey guarantees honey's total antibacterial activity level of 20+. This Total Activity is mostly from the Hydrogen Peroxide activity of honey (as opposed to the Non Peroxide Activity of UMF Honey). Both Total (Active) and Non Peroxide (UMF) activities are tested by certified independent lab in New Zealand. In regards to health benefits, UMF is more stable over time, does not break down with heat, light or body enzymes and may even grow in strength over time."""" …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Nice snack that lasts!,5,"This bar has cranberries, almonds, and macadamia nuts (NOT bits and pieces!) as their main ingredients, in a soft honey-like glaze to keep it all together. I refrigerate them in the summer or they kind of ""wilt"". The ingredients are fresh, and the nuts are crunchy. What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them. Those nuts are meant to be chewed and not inhaled, unlike a lot of snacks that disappear as soon as you get the wrapper off. I can't eat one in front of my favorite dog, as this is one snack I am too fond of to share with her... much to her dismay.

 Delicious and safe for Celiac sufferers,5,"Let me just start off by saying I like oatmeal a little more than most people. At my old job they had a contest to get to know your coworkers a little bit better. They had unusual facts about people up and you had to guess who each fact was talking about. My fact was ""This person has eaten a bowel of oatmeal for breakfast every single day of the past 25 years."" For the past 10 years or so I've usually eaten another bowel as a bedtime snack as well. Suffice to say, I've eaten of a lot of oats in my lifetime. Almost two years ago I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease after throwing up almost every day for six months. Unfortunately, the only treatment is a totally gluten free diet for the rest of my life. I wasn't too upset about that until I learned that included oatmeal as almost all oatmeal in this country is processed with the same machinery as wheat which will contaminate the safe oats. Not wanting to break my streak I started searching for a gluten free alternative. Thankfully, Bob's Red Mill was there for me. I bought a bag and tested it out to make sure I could handle it better than other oatmeals out there. Almost two years and almost 1500 bowels later, I can safely say that this stuff is perfectly safe as well as quite tasty. Thanks Bob, for letting my continue on my streak with my favorite breakfast! …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Food Should Taste Good ....,5,"... and these do!! Wow! I was really surprised at how good these chips are. These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there. The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right. They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips. Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt. Not these. An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium. For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts. Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack. Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges? These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers. Yum!! I'll definitely be purchasing these from Superstore -- I've never seen them in the stores, and I simply must have more of them! …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Where is the flavor of the Rainforest,1,"This is the third product by this company I have tried. First was the one with the chimpanzee on the label. Fine chocolate, but alas no chimpanzee flavor. Then the one with a bat on the label. Can you guess the outcome? Again, the chocolate itself was good, but no flavor of bat! So fine, I figured since trees are stationary and not moving like chimps and bats, maybe third time is a charm. Perhaps there is some sort of exotic Brazilian wood flavor in this chocolate. So, I bite into it..and what do I taste? Chocolate and mint! Now who knows, maybe the mint leaves was lugged about by some native in the rainforest. But really now, a forest is the trees! Even if the mint was grown in the Superstore, that's not what I expect at all! I want this chocolate bar to taste like honest to god wood! Well, I was fooled again. Chimpanzee chocolate bar, no chimp flavor. Bat chocolate bar, no bat flavor. Rainforest chocolate bar, no tree flavor. So again I am forced to give an otherwise quality product one star. It's a shame, if they would stop their false advertising and just advertise this as a mint chocolate bar, I'd give it four or even five stars. I'm not normally a fan of mint but I did like this chocolate bar. Or would have if it had tasted like a tree! …",4 out of 27 users found this review helpful

 A Great Deal...,5,"SodaStream soda syrups may be a bit more expensive than off-brands, but this sampler pack is a great way to try out their different offerings and decide for yourself which (if any) flavors of theirs you like the most without committing to an entire 12 liter syrup bottle. Included in this pack are one trial-size, single-use ""vial"" of the following flavors: -Orange (Like ""Crush) -Diet Dr. Pete (Like ""Diet Dr. Pepper"") -Energy (Like ""Red Bull"") -Diet Pink Grapefruit -Diet Lemon-Lime (Like ""Diet Sprite"") -Root Beer (Like ""Barq's"") -Diet Cola (Like ""Diet Coke"") -Dr. Pete (Like Dr. Pepper) -Diet Cranberry-Raspberry -Fountain Mist (Like ""Mountain Dew"") -Diet Root Beer (Like ""Diet Barq's"") -Lemon-Lime (Like ""Sprite"") Each ""vial"" makes one liter. The instruction say to ""twist-off"" the tops, but I find this impracticable and it is much easier to simply cut the tops off with a pair of scissors. Also, though the box states that it contains ""Dr. Pete"" and ""Diet Dr. Pete,"" it actually contains ""Pete's Choice"" and ""Diet Pete's Choice."" The name may be the only difference, but I find that these flavors taste more like ""Mr. Pibb"" than ""Dr. Pepper."" Finally, if you like ""Red Bull,"" you will be pleasantly surprised with how close this syrup comes to the real deal. If you buy the SodaStream solely as a ""Red Bull"" maker, you can save alot of money! All in all, this is a great way to try out the best flavors SodaStream has to offer.

 Not good for super-automatic espresso/coffee makers,4,"This looks like a pretty decent coffee, but its not suitable for super-automatic espresso/coffee makers. Problem is that the beans are TOO oily. Good if you self-grind... bad if you put the beans in a large hopper and expect them to automatically slide into the grinder when needed...

 Childhood memories re-lived!,5,"Without giving away too much information on my advancement in years, I may say that I was a child of the 70's and recall with great fondness and slight nausea the intemperate consumption of many of the candies contained within this gift basket. At almost five pounds, this basket not only represents a good deal, but also the potential for hyperglycemic diabetic coma for the unaware and foolish. Of course, most of those who would actually be nostalgic for 70's candy would be in their thirties and forties, and thus have sense enough to not indulge to the point of fatality. As I gleefully pulled out the contents of this basket I was struck by how many of these candies were either metaphors or candy copies of nonpharmaceutical and, in many cases, highly addictive and illegal drugs. The most obvious examples are the cigarette candies. Since when was cigarette smoking considered exemplary behavior to be modeled in candy form to encourage impressionable youngsters? Granted, they may be novelty candies and claim innocent fun, but I'm sure the Surgeon General would not be overly pleased at the kid-targeted promotion of a habit that increases both mortality and morbidity for millions and incurs health care costs in the billions. But that's not the worst of it. Can anyone claim that candy buttons are anything other than practice in the consumption of LSD blotter paper? Pixy Stix are long tubes filled with pixy dust, which in actuality is flavored sugar but metaphorically represents angel dust or PCP. Like PCP, pixy dust can be sprinkled on other confections to enhance their effects. Wax fangs are just softer versions of real fangs, and real fangs are used to pierce skin, just like hypodermic needles. Likewise, licorice pipes are only one step away from both marijuana and crack pipes. Looking back at the candies of my youth I began to wonder of a possible conspiracy between confectioners and drug pushers (especially the tobacco companies). I seem to recall a shredded bubblegum product called ""Big League Chew"" and a cooked extract from unripe poppy seed pods called ""Opium Den Smoke""--more evidence of a possible conspiracy and the perfect opportunity for the FBI to step in and apply the RICO statutes to bust this putative criminal collusion wide open. …",40 out of 101 users found this review helpful

 Excellent Full-Flavored Coffee!,4,"I guess I'm a bit of a coffee snob. I always groan when friends suggest we go to Dunkin' Donuts for joe. Even their dark roast is nearly flavorless. So when I saw some of the glowing reviews for the Community coffees I was of course skeptical. I am currently spending about $10/lb. for AMAZING coffee from a local roaster. I have to buy 12 pounds at a time to get that price! So I've been looking for ways to cut my coffee budget without settling for flavorless coffee. When I saw Superstore's 30% off promo I took a chance. And boy am I glad I did! This is a very full-flavored coffee. I wouldn't say it had a complexity of flavors like my favorite African origin blends I get from my local roaster, but it is flavorful and satisfying. I just purchased 10 pounds of the Community Coffee Dark Roast, so I can't wait to try it next! One tip for longer term coffee storage: I double bag my coffee in freezer quality Hefty OneZip bags. I use the jumbo size 2-1/2 gal bags and arrange the coffee bags inside the OneZip bags so they fill up the space as much as possible. Then I put a second OneZip bag over the first but I flip the outer bag so the closure is on the OPPOSITE end from the closure of the inner bag. All these steps keep as much freezer air out of the coffee as possible. I have been keeping my coffee like that for up to 3 months and I have found no difference in taste from the first bag to the last. You can always use 1 gal freezer bags too if you store less coffee. Just make sure you use the same double bag setup. I take one pound out of the freezer at a time for making coffee, and store it in the refrigerator in a freezer bag between uses. Another little trick I have found is to cut an inch off the top of the bag with scissors as you use the coffee up. Then I fold it neatly and tightly down to the remaining coffee in the bag and clip it with a medium sized binder clip. I find I spill less coffee this way because my coffee scoop is short and doesn't reach down into the bag very well as it get's lower and lower. I know...I'm a total coffee-geek! …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" Nasty, don't be swayed by the 5-star reviews",1,"I have a feeling that Coca Cola is paying people to write 5-star reviews on their ""new"" Zico acquisition. The fact of the matter is that I have been drinking coconut water for over a year now, from Vita Coco, O.N.E., Zico (original), Zico (new Coca Cola disaster) and the bottom line is that the NEW ZICO IS DISGUSTING. It's 1) from concentrate (not pure 100% coconut water), 2) tastes really bad cold and 3) tastes even worse at room temperature. Coca Cola, in typical American corporate greed, took what was the BEST coconut water (Zico original, Mango and Passion Fruit) and absolutely and blatantly destroyed it. They really did. It's absolutely horrid and disgusting and probably not as good for you due to it being from concentrate. Should I mention that it's also more EXPENSIVE than before?

" ""Al Dente"" Oatmeal",5,"Steel cut oatmeal has a grainy, hearty texture that's more like al dente pasta than mush. American grown varieties often have a gelatinous texture between the grains. The Irish grown oatmeal is firm and nutty through and through. My electric range cooks the oatmeal in about 25 minutes. I use a straight-edged spatula to keep the oatmeal from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Avoid over-stirring to keep that nice, firm texture. More good news: Steel-cut oatmeal, like chili or stew, is better on the second day. Pour your leftovers into a bowl, lay plastic film directly on the surface of the oatmeal, and store in the 'fridge. Reheat in the microwave with a spoonful of water for a minute or two. Genuine maple syrup is the best sweetener for oatmeal, in my opinion.

 Excellent value and quality,5,"I will admit that I was worried about buying these after reading the review from the person whose pup became sick after eating four of these, but I decided to take the risk and carefully monitor my own pup. My 3-month old Golden Retriever puppy came to me with giardia (for which he has been treated, but at the time, he was still experiencing some problems), so I didn't want anything to exacerbate his gastro issues. I'm relieved (no pun intended) to say that my puppy, along with my two Great Pyrenees, and my gimpy old lab/husky mix, have all four gone through this 5-lbs package of rawhides (in just a little over a month) with no problems at all. I sent some home with my mother for her terrier mix and for my sister's doberman, and they've had no problems, either. The rawhides are a good mix of small and relatively thin, along with a some (more than half of) which are larger and thicker. There is no odd (eg., chemical) smell coming from the rawhides, and the bag is resealable - like a giant ziploc bag. I'm placing my third order (sent one bag to mom and sis for their dogs); the quality is excellent and the value is unbeatable. August 2011 Update: I have had these on a monthly auto-shipping order for several months, but the last two shipments were bags with rawhide chips that are almost entirely small and thin, and have not included the larger & thicker pieces I mentioned earlier. I hope the next shipment will bring back the larger pieces. If it does not, I do not think I will continue to purchase these. They are fine for small to medium dogs, but are simply too small for my 70+ lbs animals, and they just don't last very long. December 2011 Update: The last three shipments have seen a return to a more diverse sizing of the chips. I expect that there will continue to be some variability, but I am especially pleased with this month's bag, since it has many of the thicker chips I prefer for my big dogs. These thicker chips might be less than ideal for the smallest of dogs, though I think most determined pups would be okay with them. I plan to continue to receive this bag on a once-a-month automatic shipping order for the foreseeable future; I think it might be possible to make this bag last more than a month even giving all four of my dogs one chip a day, but we're never that orderly, and I find that I'm usually out of chips several days before a new shipment. With fewer dogs, you can expect this bag to last several months. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Bold and Mold,2,"I admittedly liked this product. People thinking ""I like smoked salmon"" may be thrown by this product at first, but think ""jerky!!"" Very chewy: the larger pieces can give your jaw a good workout, and every once in awhile you hit a peppercorn which makes your eyes water (in a good way). Good salmon flavor. I would be a happy consumer except that I have run into moldy strips in two separate orders. Got the 8 pak, and on pak #6, almost the entire contents were fuzzy. An e-mail to the company got absolutely no response, but Superstore was kind enough to replace it in spite of it being a generally non-returnable item.

 My little yorkie is 14 years old and developed digestive problems a couple of years ago,5,"My vet gave him a prescription diet which helped him tremendously but he HATED it and wouldn't eat it until he just couldn't stand being hungry any more. With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return. Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription. Not only did he like it, he was fine! I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine! I was so happy! And so was my little dog! …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 A remakably mixed review,4,"This olive oil adds a freshness to every dish that you're bound to notice. It's true what the others are saying, this oil is different than most others. When I first got tasted it strait, was shocked at the resemblence to wheat grass juice and the bitterness that lingers in the back of your throat. Compared to my regular store bought EVOO's heaviness and richness, this one is clean and bright. But my first reaction was to write the seller and find out if my bottle tasted as it should or if I'd gotten a bad bottle. They wrote back saying that the grassy flavor and ""peppery notes"" (bitterness, in my book) comes from the relatively young olives. I was also impressed by the fact that I got this in Sept and it was bottled as recently as August, probably also responsible for the fresh taste. Getting this olive oil inspired me to try some other brands and I have found a very similar taste without the bitterness in the slightly less exensive Trader Joe's Australian variety of EVOO. Both are great when used in fresh dishes and shine best when they aren't cooked. My biggest question is, why aren't people reviewing more EVOO products on Superstore. The fact that this one is the only one who's following sings it's praises here should tell you that it's worth trying. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" ""Cringe...""",1,"Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. Ok. While I love Loma Linda/Worthington products I thought perhaps I would give another company a try and ordered the mix pack. I know gluten based veggie meats can be kinda icky but I like the option. We eat vegan at home and we are flexitarians away from home. First can I tried were the breakfast sausage. These are the most edible option they offer. These actually taste good. Then I tried the chicken dinner and the steak dinner and the turkettes and I became disenfranchised with this company's products. The gluten comes out in a watery 'gravy' as they call it which is flavorless and really gross. They could add a thickener and some flavorings but they don't. The grain meat/gluten product is tasteless and has a very basic texture and is not creative in anyway to conform to the schmeat they are trying to replicate for vegans. Stick with Loma Linda or Worthington, they have some awesome products like ground meat and hotdogs/links that are great for use in everyday cooking. If you are looking for cans of different types of schmeat that all turn out to be the same lumps of brown gluten with no flavor, try Cedar Lake products. …",10 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Just not great cat food,2,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are for one of the flavors: turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. Another flavor was: water sufficient for processing, chicken, and liver. At least there is turkey and/or chicken in it, but other than that its mostly nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Some Friskies flavors are even worse than the ones I listed and contain no real meat. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods. …",7 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" Real Breakfast food, serious food budget savings",5,"Compare the per serving price of this oatmeal to any ""superfoods"" touting breakfast cereal concoction, I dare you. You'll be able to have the oatmeal and few fistfuls of multivitamins for the 1-serving price of the multiV. drenched food-like product. Our household is trying hard to correct breakfast - and breakfast skipping - habits these days, and we face down the common issue of just not having the time or inclination to fuss with anything not pre-prepared in the morning. However, you can do an internet search and find a zillion good ways to start the oatmeal the night before. This idiot-proof method works for us: 1 cup oatmeal, 5 cups water. Put in pan on stove, bring to a boil, turn off heat and cover pan. In the morning, add any fruit, nuts, cinnamon or sweeteners (we use Splenda), however you like it. Bring to simmer and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. (You may need to add a bit of water - these oats are VERY absorbant.) Serve topped with yogurt, fruit or milk, and with extreme satisfaction that you aren't feeding the family sugary junk or mass-produced enriched cardboard.

 WARNING -- read reviews--Canidae has changed their formula.,1,"My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet. Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea. My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks. After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet! Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill. My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula. Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae. …",20 out of 23 users found this review helpful

" The Bursting Flavor and Healing Power of Blessedly Beautiful, Simple Salt Crystals",5,"These coarse crystals have the minerals intact, which is vital to the salt benefit and function. I don't know when or why purveyors of salt began removing the natural mineral content, but that action involved a frightening ignorance. For certain types of specific health issues (see below), the minerals in the sea salt crystals seem to work better for me in their crystalline (or coarse) form, than when I grind the salt, as I do for cooking or table usage salt. As others have noted, mineral-rich, coarse-sea-salt freshly grinded onto food is much crisper in its culinary effect, more satisfying to the taste buds, than pre-granulated, plain table salt (which has the minerals removed, minerals found naturally in sea salt and which enhance both health benefits and flavor bursts). Also, old style, granulated table salt has an added disadvantage from the fairly recent addition of a variety of anti-caking chemicals, some of which contain aluminum (silicoaluminate)... which I'm concerned may be a brain cell deteriorative, possibly at baseline cause for Alzheimer's. If I take a pinch of salt crystals (coarse sea salt contains crystals) 2 or sometimes 4 times per day, and place them in my mouth, moving them around to dissolve the salt in saliva on my teeth and gums, I find that both teeth and gums retain a much higher degree of health. I had begun having minor tooth aches periodically, and this practice has alleviated that. As noted above, I'm 60-years-old; and with a debilitating liver ailment since I was 9, I find that when I have an attack of severe abdominal and back muscle cramps (which I get fairly frequently), a pinch of sea salt crystals in my mouth will stop those cramps. In fact, when I take small amounts of sea salt crystals regularly enough, I don't get those cramps at all. The cause and effect is immediate and direct, so I know this works for me. From my experience, plain table salt, or even sea salt without the mineral content will not give this beneficial effect. (I'm guessing it's the magnesium content which works here, though, it might be the wholeness of the natural balance of the particular mineral group within unadulterated salt). Of course, I also drink one, preferably two glasses of water along with the salt crystals, ingesting the water before, after, or both. I learned about the many benefits of sea salt crystals (with the natural mineral content not having been leached away in well meaning ignorance) from Dr. Batmanghelidj's book Cancer & Depression: Their Common Cause & Natural Cure . I recommend that book very highly and hope to be able to review it also. Dr Batman's books explain how, when, why, and how much water the body needs for optimum health, and sea salt crystals are a vital part of that program. Note that in this book he explains also how, when, and why a person can take too much salt and water. I suppose I'm ""lucky"" that I have a barometer for sea salt crystal needs. When I'm not taking enough the cramps return. During hot weather (or under other dehydrating conditions) when the body loses more salt and water, I have to increase the intake of both. As far as I recall, Dr. Batman hadn't mentioned the connection of sea salt to alleviate regular large muscle cramping. That I discovered this on my own after I had been taking the sea salt regularly, due to reading Dr. Batman's book. Bless this man for standing up to so many medical fallacies which are literally creating diseases, then causing addiction to high cost medications which do NOT cure the ailment, but add several other ailments into a complex medical condition which piles prescriptions on top of prescriptions.

" Excellent Idea, but...",3,"First, the lack of enthusiasm for this product has nothing to do with it's quality. Not only are Shirataki products by ""Miracle Noodle"" good quality but an excellent product if you are counting carbs or calories. My only problem is with the form of the ""Rice""... it tastes and cooks up just fine but it really isn't a substitution for rice, it's texture and size are more akin to small pasta **** the size of peppercorns... (think Spetzle or Acini de Pepe) ((sp?))... Actually, the first thing I thought about when I cooked up my first batch was that they were slightly smaller versions of the tanslucent ""Bubbles"" that people seem to like to put in their iced tea and coffee drinks nowadays... (which in turn, remind me of little round gummy candies with no taste.) Shirataki noodles are an EXCELLENT no-cal/no-carb substitute for pasta... but if you are thinking that you're going to get anything like a ""rice"" substitute... I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you... just go ahead and get the noodles. BTW.. the Miracle brand of Shirataki products are the lowest in Calories and Carbs that I have found but if you want something with just a couple more calories and only about 3-4 grams of carbs, you might want to try one of the shiritaki noodles out there that have tofu in them, they taste ""hardier"" and are much more like eating true pasta...

 Excellent Source of Magnesium,5,"If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too. I've also tried a flavored version of this product (Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder).

 Best peanut butter in the every-day grocery store,5,"I guess there might be other natural peanut butters for sale in expensive health-food stores, but I haven't tried them. However, in the regular super-markets, the only peanut butter I'll buy is SKIPPY NATURAL! It is the best tasting, and won't clog your arteries. For those who think it is un-healthy because they remove some peanut oil and replace it with natural palm oil, I disagree. Peanut oil separates and has to be stirred up every time, or you have to refrigerate it, and then it doesn't spread well. Palm oil has saturated fat, but it is the healthy kind, produced by the palm tree, not chemically altered partially hydrogenated oil like in regular p.b. Palm oil is high in oleic acid, like olive oil, among many other things, which are good for you. Sure, plain peanuts and salt makes a pretty healthy p.b., but it is inconvenient and my family doesn't like it, and I don't care for it much myself.

 Great Gluten-Free Bread by Namaste,4,"After trying several recipes for gluten-free bread, I find many taste like cardboard. Namaste makes a great mix which I found is made even better by adding fennel and rye seeds to it. Very tasty. I highly recommend all the Namaste products. I have tried and love the pizza mix, the waffle mix which I make blueberry pancakes out of, and the chocolate cake mix which I make cupcakes out of. That way I can freeze some for later.

 Ordering a 2nd garden,5,"I am very happy with this garden so happy I am ordering a 2nd one. I planted salad greens just a week ago and the plants are growing so quick you can see the difference each day. I work a day time job so I have the light come on about the time I get home and stay on all night - that way it is almost like a second lamp and I can look and admire my plants as much as I want. It is fun watching them grow and I can't wait to harvest them. The salad green kit said that you can start harvesting in about 2.5 weeks, and at the rate these plants are growing I believe that to be true. I have tried growing fruits and vegatables indoors before but I never had much luck. The thought of being able to eat freshly picked food is enough to make me buy another garden. I can't wait for them to come out with the Strawberry seed pods (I will probably need a 3rd garden then). I now had my first salad with the salad greens; it was so good I made a 2nd larger salad. I am very happy with this garden. …",40 out of 42 users found this review helpful
 an effective weapon in the arsenal...,4,"In certain applications, Terro's Ant Dust can be an effective tool in attempting to control ants. Contrary to what some have said, the dust does not kill ants on contact, but given some time, the dust does seem to be effective in combating ants, as they will generally avoid areas treated by the dust. As the dust is white, it's usually easy to tell where the dust has been applied, unless the area happens to be white. After spreading the dust under bricks and various rocks where ants are nesting and egg cases are present, I found that there were no live ants in the area the next day. When dust was sprayed into cracks in rock walls and sidewalks where ants were present, once again, no ants a day later. The dust will keep them out of the area for a while, although how long depends on things like the weather. The powder isn't quite `waterproof' as cIaimed, but it does resist watering or rain washing it away. You may need to reapply occasionally. The thing about ants is that they are resourceful, determined, and relentless. Unless the ants are killed, they almost never give up. When this ant dust prevents them from taking a particular path, the ants will take an alternate route, if one is available. Be prepared to either spread more dust, or kill the ants. Unless they have no other options, they will probably keep coming. Of course, you always want to use this product in a safe and approved manner. Do not apply it anywhere near where food is prepared, or where there is any possibility that children or pets might be exposed to it. I only use it outdoors, and recommend wearing a surgical mask and safety glasses when applying, especially when there is wind. Shaking the dust from the container works fine for some applications, but with the one pound can, you may not have a lot of control. Applying the dust into a tiny hole or crack could be a problem. The dust is very fine, and can be applied as a spray, but the trick is that you will need to come up with a suitable spray container. An empty nasal spray bottle, works well for me. Enlarge the opening in the nozzle, and with a little practice, you should be able to apply the dust into nooks and cracks. The dust isn't always easy to apply evenly, so I use an old toothbrush to spread it around when necessary. This dust probably won't wipe out the colony, but could be an effective tool for helping to control ants. Ant colonies are generally sensitive to any kind of attack, and often will withdraw when they experience losses of life. Good luck! :) …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Bad Pump,1,Bought a unit for my 80 year old Mother at Christmas. Great for a month. And the pump started making noise. Got so bad she had to turn it off. Emailed the company and they sent a new pump out. That one lasted another month. Noise could be heard all over the house. Emailed company again. No reponse. Called several times. Customer service got back to me and said they had a batch of faulty pumps from China and new ones were arriving the beginning of April. They had been redesigned. One would be shipped by the 15th of April. Its now June 4th and nothing. I have left several messages with customer service. Hoping one of these days someone will call me back and take care of this. With the kits and shipping this cost me over $200. And I am unable to return it since almost 6 months has passed. I should of returned it right away. …,79 out of 81 users found this review helpful
 Probably destined for Big Lots (all the details here),2,"I don't want to be over-negative here -- this product will definitely meet the specific needs of some folks such as those who have little time or, college students who live by microwave cooking. But for the average consumer, this product has some clear drawbacks. There are five facets to my evaluation: ease of preparation, flavor, health aspects/portion size, environmental concerns, and storage, (I'm not including price, which people can weigh for themselves) so I'll enumerate my observations here: 1. Preparing the dish is a bit of a pain, compared to the Healthy Choice frozen dinners. It's essentially a five-step process, although I did find it necessary to additionally microwave the ""finished"" dish for an extra 30 seconds. I found it difficult to read the instructions on the side and on the top due to the tiny font size, but young people will probably not experience this problem. Microwaving the sauce can generate a tiny mess because you pull back a corner of the packet to allow steam to escape and mine bubbled out slightly. So, I did have to go back and wipe out the microwave with a damp rag. The water fill line is lightly stamped into the clear plastic and is near impossible to see initially -- you really have to look for it (on each end). The manufacturer would have benefited the consumer by putting larger font instructions on a removable card on the top so that one could just stick it under a refrigerator magnet to see what to do at each step; however, once you've prepared this dish the first time, it would be easy to do a second time without instructions. 2. My wife and I both tried the product and we came to essentially the same conclusion... it's not nearly as tasty as the Healthy Choice frozen dinners, which we like very much. The pasta comes out remarkably well, au dente, very tasty. Of course, ""taste"" is very subjective and we are pretty discriminating so I'll just say this: if you think that McDonald's hamburgers taste pretty good, you'll probably be okay with the taste of this dish. With the sauce, the dish has a fennel-Italian sausage ambiance and it's not at all bland. I'm not a vegetarian but, honestly, I think they'd have been better off to go with a meatless marinara sauce for broader appeal and better flavor. 3. The product (entire dish) has 340 calories, 6 grams of fat, and 2 grams of saturated fat. The dry weight is 6.95 ounces. In terms of portion size, I weigh 280 pounds and I'm a big eater -- the portion size was plenty large enough for me and the meal was hearty to the degree that I was not hungry again an hour later. 4. Environmentally, this baby is a bit of a nightmare. While the plastics are mostly of the recyclable type, most people who typically recycle plastic beverage bottles are probably not going to recycle this -- I didn't bother (even though I recycle a LOT of plastics, glass, and paper) because it takes more hot water to wash/rinse out the two plastic bowls and the lid than the plastic is worth -- in other words, in terms of energy use, this packaging is a loser. Unfortunately, I can see no other way to set it up -- the manufacturer has already reduced the necessary components to the least number possible. 5. The best aspect of this product is that it's very convenient to store, no refrigeration required, and the bowls stack nicely. The manufacturer's ""use by"" date extends for about a year, although I suspect that it would keep even longer than that under ideal dry storage conditions. To summarize, you could slightly improve the flavor of this dish (which would also boost the calories and the fat content) by sprinkling some freshly grated Parmesan cheese over the top of it. But the bottom line is this... even though it would take longer, I would much prefer boiling a little of my own pasta and using some canned spaghetti sauce, warmed in the microwave, OR, I would recommend buying the Healthy Choice frozen dinners which are much more convenient to prepare and tastes remarkably superior to this product. …",14 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Solid Medium Roast Coffee with Just a Hint of Bold. Good Flavor. Not Acidic.,5,"Good choice for your morning coffee if you like a medium, slightly bold flavor. Vienna coffee is not a real bold coffee, so medium roast coffee drinkers should like the flavor.

 Meh...,3,"First of all let me state that I love my Aerogarden. HOwever, there were some issues with the herb kit. For one thing, I think it's sort of impossible to grow a reasonable amount of each herb in such a tiny space under fluorescent lighting. IF I grew this again (which I won't) there are certainly some things I'd do differently. The manual advised not to thin the plants when they sprouted--mistake #1, especially for the basil--one basil took off and shaded the others, which were never able to catch up. My purple basil and chives grew pathetically. In fact, the entire time I grew this kit the chives had maybe four sad little stems. Flavor left a little to be desired as well, especially for the dill. Barely three months after planting, my herb garden virtually self-destructed. This I blame on the fact that the company advises you to just keep throwing nutrient tablets in every two weeks, never rinsing out the bowl to keep the salts from becoming too concentrated/imbalanced. Flushing the system is just basic maintenance with hydroponics! In my bigger hydroponic garden, I have lettuces that are still going strong after four+ months, so there's no reason this should've burnt itself out so soon. I think it's a bit of a deception on the part of Aerogrow; properly maintaining the garden would extend it's life greatly and you wouldn't be coming back to buy a new seed kit so soon. But I was willing to let my herb garden go so I could try the cherry tomatoes. So far so good with that kit, they are just now getting ready to bloom and I have high hopes for what seem to be very healthy looking tomato plants. Next time though, I'll probably just buy the master gardener's kit, which gives you everything you need for one year's growth, except seeds, for $40.00. I have amassed quite the seed collection, so I really don't need any more overpriced seed kits. Plus, isn't it a lot more fun to experiment on your own instead of following the instructions in a manual? Like I said, I love my Aerogarden, but sometimes it's a little too ""idiot proof."" EDIT: Having grown the tomatoes to completion, I can't recommend that kit either. I didn't get very many tomatoes. The ones I got tasted pretty much just like grocery store cherry 'matoes, so okay, but this was more of a novelty than an actual productive tomato garden. Also, even though I pruned the plants at 5 weeks to make them stronger, they were in need of support. I tried to tie them to the lamp arm as suggested in the manual, but the angle is all wrong; it doesn't help at all! One of my plants fell over and died anyway, still loaded with it's meager crop of 8-10 underripe tomatoes. I think you need more vertical space, a stronger light source, and some sort of growing medium to give tomatoes the support they need. That said, I STILL LOVE THE AEROGARDEN! It's cool, and I'm not giving up on it yet. I just know it's perfect for something, but I haven't found the right plant yet. …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Quality control needed ASAP!,1,"Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control. I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each. In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in. Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them. Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.

 Diamond Pet Foods RECALLED,1,"Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled. But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up. So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now. To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too. But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too. Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food. I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat. Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny. Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky. She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains. She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named ""Taste Of The Wild"" in Bison the most. But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for ""SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"" This company makes various products that have been recalled. Such as: Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold. I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these ""better than store"" dog food and they keep getting recalled! So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the ""better"" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients. I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week. My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now. I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!

 i love these lentils,5,"We eat lentils about once a week as they are one of the more nutritious foods in existence. I have fewer 'rejects' than with other brands and they cook up quickly nice and tender without turning to mush. I sautee my veggies first: all small dice: a couple of serranos (since we eat spicy--this is optional), a large onion, a couple of carrots, lots of celery, a whole garlic fist, tomatoes (I often just use a can of organic diced tomatoes, sometimes fire-roasted), sometimes leeks (although i put those in later or they will disappear) with whole cumin seed, oregano, turmeric and curry powder (I use the Simply Organic brand which I like the best after much exploration). Seasonings can vary. Coarse grind black pepper. A little trocomare or herbamare depending if I make my own stock, use prepackaged or just water. Sometimes add leftover chicken or lamb. After the veggies are quite sauteed add the liquid and lentils and bring to slow simmer. Do not let them boil hard but they need to slow simmer to cook. Hmmmm. I may need to go make some now. Especially delicious the second and third days. I add fresh parsley just as serving or sometimes serve over fresh spinach to just slightly cook it. Pita or cornbread goes well. My family enjoys different types of cheese as topping. I am on my third order of these and have yet to find a stone. Update: When I really did just go make these I realized that those unused to using bulk products may not know you need to sort through any product like this. I just pour them into a container and then have another container to slowly pour them into as I sort through them. My new shipment are the BEST lentils I have EVER used in about fifty years anywhere. Only had about ten discards (any lentil that I would not want to eat and I am very picky--broken, dirty, etc.) Also, I just read the instructions on the package which do not make clear that you need to sort through and then rinse the lentils before using. Do not salt any bean-type product until the end or they will be tough. I don't use recipes so I realize that my seasoning amounts are unclear. The only thing you need to add right away to the saute is if you use cumin seed. You can always add more of everything else later. If you want it spicier you can also add something like cayenne, even after serving. I forgot to mention that I sautee all my veggies in a bit of coconut oil for health reasons (it is the only stable oil). You do not taste this later and I finish it at the end of cooking with some good olive oil. When I mentioned the fist of garlic: this must be minced. I use a meat cleaver to smash the cloves to peal more easily and then fine dice. Wait ten more minutes to allow the allicin to develop DONT WAIT LONGER. Allicin is the anticarcinogenic property of garlic and must be exposed to oxygen to develop, but it will start to diminish after about fourteen minutes. OK--there is my novel on cooking lentils! Hope this is useful to someone. …",26 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 Another great dark K-cup coffee,4,"I love the rich, full-bodied flavor of a dark-roast coffee. When I bought my first Keurig machine I wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast K-cups that I could find.

 Insanely powerful,5,"I bought this oil after reading all of the reviews that mentioned just how strong it is. However, it can't be understated just how powerful it is. I have been using it for making cinnamon hard candy. I put a half teaspoon of the cinnamon oil in a blue, Kitchenaid measuring spoon and set it aside for a few moments. When I picked up the spoon again, I noticed that the oil was blue colored. Upon further inspection, I discovered that the oil had actually eaten away at the plastic--it was like I had put nail polish remover (acetone) in the spoon. Do not use this product with plastic measuring spoons! If you're planning to make hard candy with this as well, I'd also recommend that you let the sugar mixture cool quite a bit before adding the cinnamon oil. Adding it at the 300 degrees F needed for the hard crack stage just leads to an overpowering cloud of cinnamon in your kitchen and flavorless candy. This product is good stuff; just be very careful when using it. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Dog back from vet.....,1,"Back from vet. Vet is about 100% sure it was this chew stick that upset my dog. His digestive tract is inflammed and will have to be on meds. He is not allowed to eat anything today. My vet said that even one is a lot for my size dog (I brought this to the vet with me), but bag said small dog, one per day (dog weighs 20 pounds). He said it obviously upset his digestive tract. He was throwing up bits of it over 24 hrs after having just one. The vet said my dog is VERY HEALTHY except for this. He is a little over a year old and in great shape...until he had one of these. AND FOR THE RECORD....My dog HAS HAD RAWHIDE chew sticks before with NO ill effects.

 Vile & Foul,1,"I have never written a review before but feel I must based on the terrible quality of this product. Before trying it, it smelled and looked fine. The nutritional profile is very good-protein, fiber, carbs, calories-but the taste is horrendous. I am personally content with bland foods, odd flavors and eat an almost sugar free diet. But when this stuff hits your mouth, the taste resembles that of soil mixed with feces. I mixed 2 tablespoons (half the serving size) with 4oz unsweetened almond milk and on the first sip I uncontrollably gagged. I immediately added a whole packet of stevia and that still didn't sufficiently mask the taste. It is completely obvious that the manufacturer spent all the money on finding a way to isolate the protein and absolutely NONE on taste, or taste testing. Based on another review, I purchased Living Harvest. It is super delicious! It does have sugar in it, but not much. There's only 7 grams. The protein content is only 10 grams, but it's edible-which is more than I can say for Manitoba.

It is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other ""gourmet"" salts, but it is only 15 cents per ounce, not 15 dollars.

It has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and CLEAN is always good in my book. As a treat, I sometimes Iick the tip of my index finger, sprinkle a little of this on it, and then pretend like I'm getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter, but without the lime.

 What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical,1,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands. This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi. Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering. The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much. While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal. Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products. Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money). Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer. One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer. Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail *Concentrate Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99 Liters of product per container 12 Flavor/l $0.42 *Carbonator Volume of CO2 130 Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99 CO2 cost per liter $0.23 *Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter Equipment cost $89.00 Equipment life (years) 5 Discount rate (cost of money) 8% Liters per month 10.00 Monthly amortized cost $1.80 Cost of equipment per liter $0.18 *Water Cost with Brita Filtration Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004 Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95 Brita cost per liter $0.0373 Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377 (assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration) ***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2 SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73 Without filtered water: SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65 *****What does CO2 Really Cost???? THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW *Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit) weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2 cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35 CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams *Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation losses: 10% available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85% net accessible CO2 of total: 77% usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams *Output carbonated liters of water: 2,479 cost per liter in USD$: $0.014 *SodaStream Output SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product) Cost per refill: $30.00 cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231 *SodaStream Markup Economics ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534% math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing This is an incredible 1500% markup Pros Saves plastic Allows flexible mixture of flavors Cons Cost of output is not compelling Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit ***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times. At the time of this review, I did NOT have an investment in SodaStream either short or long. In the past, I have both owned the stock and shorted it (bet against it). I may be on either side of the trade by the time you read this -- I am not very sentimental. …",31 out of 36 users found this review helpful
