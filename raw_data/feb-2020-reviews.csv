 Very good but not earthshattering,5,"I think a few reviewers have gotten carried away (or maybe they just never had anything but canned before). These beans are a good value and definitely taste better than canned, but they're not going to change your life. The light packaging, long shelf life, and simple preparation make this a good product for camping or emergency supplies. It's not easy to tell from the picture, but the bags are zip-lock type so you can make a portion of the package and reseal the rest. However, the instructions only cover the amount of water appropriate for the whole bag, so you're on your own to measure for a portion. Hint: start conservatively because it's easy enough to add more water later. Overall nutrional values are better than average. I like to mix both cheese and salsa into my beans, but the result is fairly high in total sodium. Sodium level of the bean mix itself isn't too bad, but I wish they added less salt because anybody can easily add salt if desired, but you can't take out what they've already added. Since many people like to add things to their beans anyway, it would be ideal for the beans to start out with as little sodium as possible. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 CONTAINS FLAX!,1,"I never expected granola to contain flax seed -- something I'm allergic to. I sat down to a nice bowl of granola, and it sure tasted good! Then my throat started to itch. Then my stomach started to cramp. I stopped eating and checked the label -- sure enough, near the bottom, 'ground flax seed'. My husband, who is not much of a granola eater, tried some a few days later, and although he isn't allergic to flax, he found it still made his mouth and throat itch. If you're not allergic to flax, by all means enjoy it, but if you are -- DON'T TOUCH IT! …",2 out of 25 users found this review helpful
" Flavorful, Creamy & Smooth Split Pea Soup",5,"If you struggled for years using store bought green split peas and have never been satisfied with your soup, struggle no more. For years I tried different recipes and was never satisfied with the end result because of the inferior product I was using. My green split pea soup has never been better now that I started using this company's product. Palouse Brand's product is hardy, tender, flavorful, creamy and smooth when cooked. There is no dissapointment here. This farming family knows how to delivery fresh! …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 People consider this refreshing?,1,I'm sure the flaw with this product is with coconut water in general and not with Zico. I gasped when I first sipped this drink. There is a strange saltiness in the taste and the passion fruit and orange peel are barely perceivable. Superstore was kind enough to refund me the cost of this order. Lesson to be learned: try to find a sample of a product before you buy a case of it. …,11 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Vegan Natural Kosher Choice,5,"Vegan. Natural. Kosher. I love Indian spinach (palak.) Alu palak (or aloo palak, meaning potato with spinach) is a very traditional Indian dish, also very often served with thali meals. Thalis meals are served on separate dinner plates to each guest with small bowls on each plate holding the various tasty choices. This Tasty Bite Aloo Palak is wonderful for adding another easy serve choice to your own 'thali' creation or as an additional item for an Indian or Asian-themed meal. Alu palak is great spooned over basmati rice or with Indian breads [or vegan whole wheat tortillas.] Can also be used as a base for a more elaborate mix of your favorite vegetables and/or beans. Tofu cubes are another delightful addition. I have also used it to make a delicious(!) spinach soup by adding Asian buckwheat noodles. Nicely spiced and not spicy by Indian standards. The spinach is a puree, partly a wonderful spinach gravy, accompanied by small diced potato cubes. A great choice for those who like or enjoy creating with spinach dishes. Made with spinach [palak], potatoes [aloo or alu], tomatoes, onions, water, sunflower oil, salt, cornstarch, ginger, garlic, sugar, chilies, turmeric, and spices. 200 calories and 6g protein per pouch.

 Not good like they say it is!,1,"I'm a regular daily pepsi drinker, as are a few of my friends. Some of us has tried the new pepsi throwback and NONE of us like it! It tastes totally different and almost reminds me of ""coke"" and it is not refreshing. If you drink it regularly (instead of coffee/tea for your caffeine fix) then you will definitely notice the taste difference.

 Best deal on AMZ for bottle pumps,5,"These pumps are very durable. I've been using the same pump for over a year for my Torani coffee syrups and have no problem with them whatsoever. The fit is perfect and I never have syrup running down the side of the bottle. The only thing I make sure I do when changing the bottles is rinsing out the pump as sugar crystals can dry around the pump mechanism and cause the pump to get stuck. Cleaning is easy: just let the pump soak in clean, warm water (no soap necessary) and then pump water through it a few times to blast away the remaining sugar residue. Maintaining these pumps this way prolongs the life of the pump. This five-pack is the best deal on Superstore. Others sold separately cost more by other shippers because of the added shipping costs. A five-pack now allows me to keep several bottles of different syrup flavors available to chose from while making my morning cappuccino. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Full of chemicals,3,"Full of chemicals, zinc oxide, niacinamide,ferrous sulfate, copper gluconate, vitamin A, Palmirate, calcium pantothenate, and 3 other synthetic vitamins. Are these all Fortified nutrition? if not what the reason for them. Label DOESN'T say non GMO. Superstore web page says its non GMO. Have to go with label. Soy based, Superstore didn't say it was Soy. Soy has been knocked down lately as having too much estrogen. Use small amounts and infrequently.

 Buyer's Beware! NOT A Plant!,1,"The picture and description of this item is for a pepper plant, or at least I construed it to be that way. What you get is a small can full of dirt with A pepper seed inside, not a living plant. If you're expecting to receive a pepper plant, as I did, you will be disappointed. $12 bucks for one (1) seed is a bit on the high side. Just thought I might prevent some other Buyer from making the same mistake that I did. Plus, it is no longer judged to be the hottest pepper in the world. The Moruga Scorpion now takes that honor. …",11 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Brooks Tangy Ketchup,5,"I grew up with Brooks Tangy Ketchup in my home and anything else always seemed sub par. My preference for Brooks carried over into adulthood. When the local WalMart quit carrying Brooks Tangy Ketchup, I was able to get it at a local grocery. Although more expensive overall than WalMart, I would go to the local grocery explicitly to get Brooks Tangy Ketchup. Today I stopped in, and there was none on the shelf. I inquired and sadly, they no longer carry it. Upon returning home I immediately went to the internet and found it is still available. That's a good thing. But it is interesting to note that there is obviously a very loyal fan base for the product so why did it disappear from the grocery shelves? I hope it comes back to the grocery, but at least it is now available online. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 I Can't Understand the negative reviews,4,"I bought two of these, and have been using them for a couple weeks now. They are well built, they seal nicely, and they work great. I've been testing them out on various teas - loose chamomile, green tea, I even took some Tazo out of the tea bags and tried it in the Solofill - all tests passed with flying colors. There isn't much documentation out there for using a Keurig as a tea brewer from loose, but I am extremely pleased withe the results so far - it will press tea from too weak to overly strong depending on grind and amount. I ground some coffee and tried it in the solo - it was great. The pressed coffee using Solofill and Keurig tastes superior to the drip-brewed coffee in our Melitta or Krups coffee maker. A coarser grind on teas and coffees seems to work better, on fine grind the water has trouble pressing through the medium. Cleaning them is quite easy, as long as you don't wait for the grounds to dry overnight inside the Solofill. …",30 out of 31 users found this review helpful
 Great pans for wood pellets!,5,"I recently made the switch over to wood pellets from clay-based litters. In doing so, I needed to buy some new litter boxes, and the Van Ness sifting pans seemed to fit the bill. I've been using them for two weeks now and love how easy they are to use. I don't know how well they would work with clay-based litters - I never really liked the sifting litter boxes I had used when I used to use clay. However, for wood pellets (which are biodegradable, odor absorbing, cheaper, and last longer) it works great. The sifting slots are big enough to let all of the sawdust fall through, but the solid pellets and solid waste remain on top. It's also nice that they give you an extra bottom pan to swap out when cleaning. The boxes themselves easily fit my cats (one is rather large at around 15 lbs.) and they had no problem adjusting to them from the XL Booda Domes we used to use. I purchased 3 of these (one for each cat), and I would definitely recommend them to anyone else using wood pellets for litter. …",28 out of 29 users found this review helpful
 OMG - The horrors....the horrors.,1,"Everyone in my family shares my opinion that these things taste absolutely HORRIBLE. I feel really bad for someone who needs to eat Gluten/Dairy/Soy-free or Vegan/Kosher foods. If I had to live on these alone (and I don't), I'd convert back to being a non-vegan or whatever. We all tried the Cherry Pie flavor, and what this thing has to do with cherry pies is way beyond me. It's a lump of semi-solid goop with some nuts and dried fruits that taste sour and bitter and somewhat sticky. Simply gross to the point I couldn't even finish one bar. I may not be a health food nut, but I know what tastes like **** when I taste it...and these things are **** all the way. Steer clear. Even 1/2 hour after, I still have that horrible taste in my mouth and need to go brush my teeth to get rid of it. …",1 out of 16 users found this review helpful
" Does work, leaves hole in pocket",4,"I hosted a Flavor Tripping party at my university with about 60 people using these tablets. Needless to say, the tablets are quite a bit more sketch than offering berries, but considerably easier to obtain. The taste of the tablet isn't great, but isn't so bad anyone spit it out. After dissolving, I had a variety of foods for tasting available... about 95% of those who tried it seemed to enjoy it and have a noticeable difference with their taste buds. Some foods that worked well from my experience: - Grapefruit (this was by far the most impressive) - Lemons - Limes - Apple Cider (nearly became too sweet to drink) - Orange Juice (tasted particularly good) - Vinegar (might give you a stomach ache, but hammers home the idea of how warped your tastes are) Many other foods had little or no effect (as expected): pretzels, chocolate, monster energy drink, peanuts, mints, etc. One or two were uncomfortable with what the tablets did to their taste buds and refused to sample anything more. Was not a big deal as it wears off in 15-30 minutes. Final verdict: A very fun one time treat, but far too expensive to use for anything other than parties. Superstore will get these tablets to you quickly, but if you have time before your event I would try to obtain some actual berries to avoid the sketchy factor. …",23 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 The best...hands down,5,"I've been buying Tilda rice for some time now and just felt it was right to post a small review. It's by far the best rice I've ever tried. As the other reviewers mention, when cooked the rice is so light and fluffy, not a ball of glue. Perfect side dish! I use the simple cooking instructions on the side. Rinse the rice before boiling, heat up the water to boiling and dump the rice in. Cook for about 10 minutes and then rinse in a colander with hot water to stop cooking. Perfect every time! I've also purchased several times from the this vendor and have never had an issue, always prompt shipping and fresh product. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Fancy Feast a GREAT DEAL Here on Superstore!,5,"This is a direct response to the misleading, non-sensical review that starts with the headline: ""No Bargain"": First off, the ""No Bargain"" review is EXTREMELY MISLEADING. Here's the two things the reviewer got right: 1) If you DO have the Fancy Feast cases delivered regularly via Superstore's ""Subscribe & Save""-- you pay $14.02 a case. 2) If you buy 24 cans at Petsmart (at 53 cents per can) you pay $12.72 for a case. BUT HERE'S WHERE THEIR THEORY IMPLODES: If you buy your case at Petsmart (in CA-- specifically in Los Angeles where I live)-- YOU HAVE TO PAY SALES TAX... Adding as much as $1.24 to the total cost of a case. Now the Petsmart case costs $13.96. Since we've agreed that the Superstore case purchased via Superstore's ""Subscribe & Save"" costs $14.02... That means there is only a SIX CENT DIFFERENCE PER CASE between Superstore's price and California Petsmart and Walmart prices. Plus, you also have to PAY FOR GAS if you go to Petsmart or Walmart. Plus, the extra travel time to and fro. Plus, you have to drag all that cat food to your car from the store and then drag it from your car to your house. MY Superstore Fancy Feast is DELIVERED TO MY FRONT DOOR BY A UPS DELIVERY PERSON. I'll gladly pay a EXTRA SIX CENTS for DELIVERY TO MY DOOR. If folks follow your thinking-- they'll spend A LOT MORE MONEY for their cat food! Think it through! Fancy Feast is a PERFECTLY FINE DEAL HERE! …",59 out of 65 users found this review helpful
 Country Choice oats are sold at Trader Joe's,5,"I discovered this steel cut oatmeal at Trader Joe's 2-3 years ago. At ~$3 a canister, it is almost half the price of McCann's (the brand that comes in a round tin can). If you compare the two grains, Country Choice oats are cut into smaller pieces than McCann's. I find that both taste the same to me. I initially had trouble figuring out how to cook steel cut oatmeal, so I emailed Country Choice and they responded with several ways of cooking it. I now bake it in a casserole dish: 1 cup oats + 4 cups hot water, bake at 350-375 covered for 20-25 minutes, stir well, and then uncovered for 10-15 minutes. Comes out great every time! Note that steel cut oatmeal is chewy and fibrous and lasts 4-6 hours in your tummy! A great way to start an active day. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Techno-BEST,5,"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek. There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine. The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup. This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion. It's easy to hold and get out of the machine. The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier. This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut. Ingenious. Kudos to these guys. …",69 out of 71 users found this review helpful

" The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization",5,"Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet. Yes they really are that good. I'm not in thrall of the whole ""organic"" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil. The person who came up with this ""red hot"" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented. It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head. It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will. I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones. …",29 out of 31 users found this review helpful

" Smells good, but tastes like coffee-flavored water",3,"These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces. It didn't help. I compared them to Senseo medium roast pods. The Senseo pods make a cup of coffee that is stronger but doesn't taste as good. I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee. I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides. As long as I'm having bad coffee, it might as well be organic and fair trade and all. So they are somewhat useful to me, hence three stars. Coffee maker: Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer Update: I stayed in a hotel with a small, cone-type coffee maker (not a Pod system). I put two Marley pods in the maker and made about 12 ounces of coffee, which I ran through the maker a second time (the first time it was very watery looking).

 NO waste at all ----  great for training  ----  all dogs love liver treats,5,"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.) Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels). Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs. The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product. There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Here's the nutritional analysis: -100% freeze dried liver -NO additives or preservatives. -Crude protein..... not less than 50% -Crude fat..... not less than 5% -Crude fiber..... not more than 3% -Moisture..... not more than 6% …",39 out of 51 users found this review helpful

" Great product, can get cheaper at Target - CHECK FOR RECALLED POUCHES!",4,"We love Happy Tots food. My 12 month old has tried many varieties and loves them all. He has not had one sour face yet! I'm surprised at the price here, you can get this item at Target for $1.09 per pouch which is much less expensive.

 Great Organic Fair Trade Vanilla,5,"Superstore offers a good price for this vanilla. If you find you bake a lot you will be pleased with the quanity. We go through a lot of vanilla. Buying these 4oz bottles on Superstore just makes sense. They don't always pack them very well. I guess it depends on the person. These are glass bottles. So far none have ever been broken but once, one did leak. This is vanilla you can feel great about purchasing because not only is it organic but it is also fair trade (workers get paid a fair wage - no slave labor). No plastic bottles to leach into your vanilla. Wonderful scent & simply perfect for baking. Why would you ever buy the cheap immitation vanilla in the grocery store when you can have REAL vanilla? Do yourself & the enviornment a favor & make the switch. You'll be happy you did! …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Don't know what the raving is about,3,"I was expecting more (much more actually) after reading the reviews. And for the record, I really like coconut. But maybe it's that I really like REAL coconut. As for this coffee? It's okay, that's about the best I can say for it. Flavor is rather synthetic and seems to vary from pod to pod. Smell is nice. It isn't the worst flavored coffee I've ever had, but it ain't a ""contenda"" for a regular spot on my shelf. I love (and drink) many flavored coffees but I can't see going out of my way for this one again...maybe if I find it on clearance or something.

" A cheap imitation of the real deal, but maybe worth a try if you have never tasted absinthe before",2,"It is probably one of the most recognizable bottles if you are looking for absinthe. After seeing the word ""Absente"", taking a look at the bottle with the attractive vintage-like label and the line ""Absinthe refined"" you are sure you have found a nice absinthe for not so much money. Specially since most of the time the bottle comes in a box with an absinthe spoon as gift. However, although nice, the presentation does not live up to the promise. Specially after you take a look at the fake importation stamps. Problems with this drink: - First, see the tag ""Absinthe liqueur""? A liqueur means a spirit that has been bottled with added sugar. Real absinthe does not come with sugar. You are free to add it later, but it should not come with it from the manufacturer. - Second, it is made with Southern wormwood (Artemisia abrotanum). To be considered real absinthe, it has to be made with grande wormwood (Artemisia absinthium). Substitutions in the main ingredients are not valid when talking about absinthe. - Third, it is artificially colored. Real absinthe get its color from the chlorophyll of the plants of which is made, or no color at all; even though, the green is always subtle. Being bright lime green is in no way a good thing. These three points are enough for this drink to not be considered absinthe at all. Some other things to consider are: - It is overly sweet. It's no wonder, considering it is bottled with sugar. - You only can taste anise. No other herbal flavors, or the subtle bitterness of wormwood. Just anise. However, it has some good things: - It is way cheaper than real absinthe. If you are going to try it for the first time, it can be a good substitute; so if you decide later that you don't care for it, you are not out of a lot of money - this drink comes in mini bottles too. - It does louche (meaning it changes color when you add water, turning milky). That is always fun to watch. - It provides a good example of what real absinthe tastes like. Mainly of anise. Overall, this can be a fine pastis or absinthe substitute. By all means, buy a bottle and share it with your friends at a party. Just be advised that: 1- It is not absinthe. 2- You should not gift it to your absinthe-loving friend and expect a great reaction 3- You should not buy it if you have or plan to have an interest in real absinthe. This spirit just does not cut it. P.S. I refuse to discuss thujone content and other non-sense and myths in my reviews. If you are interested in thujone, go eat sage and forget absinthe altogether. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Basic reliable vanilla extract,5,"McCormick spices aren't exactly world-renowned for bringing bold new taste sensations to the world. But Vanilla isn't a bold new taste sensation; it's a, well, plain-vanilla product that most bakers will use in quantity. A baker needs their extract to be consistent, flavorful, and (unless you are made of money) inexpensive. This is all three. This is not artisinal product that will vary with every batch; this is the exact same vanilla extract bottle after bottle.

 The Original.,5,"Earl Grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can't go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend. (From the Twinings website: ""When the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family's long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey's tea by name."") Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend's particular flavor. (But that's just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 ingredients have changed SUBSTANTIALLY since new ownership,1,"""Simply Asia"" bought out ""A Taste Of Asia"" prior to 2006.

" not bad stuff, but I have serious questions",3,"Coconut water is the liquid inside an unopened coconut. It is not ""coconut milk,"" although there is often confusion about that. Coconut milk is made from the meat of the coconut after it is opened and the water poured out. Inside the coconut, the water is sterile and very benign to the human body - it has been safely used in emergencies as IV fluid! (Straight out of the coconut, that is, NOT from a Tetrapak.) Coconuts in general are very healthy items. In the South Pacific the coconut palm is called ""the tree of Life,"" because it provides so many things for a healthy life: food, water, shelter, medicine, etc. Coconut oil is one of the healthiest oils on the planet, but has been the victim of intense propaganda campaigns by corporate vegetable oil cartels and other evil critters. Coconut water tastes (to me) a bit like very watery, unsweetened tapioca, with just a hint of sourness. It is quite bland by itself, but mixes easily with fruit juices, etc. It has great health properties and is rapidly becoming popular with athletes as a superb isotonic drink, because it has great electrolyte and mineral properties, and is a natural food with no harmful side effects or hideous chemical garbage masquerading as food. Good organic coconut water is very hard to find, but there are many brands of non-organic like this one on the market. I checked out the package info and vendor's web site, but could find only general information on coconut water and its benefits, nothing specific about this exact product - where and how it is grown and harvested, the quality of the land and processing, etc. That is not a good sign. For an item that is very health oriented, the only reasons I can see for hiding that information are pure marketing ignorance, or knowing that the truth would not paint a good picture. Rain forests are reportedly being cut down for coconut palm plantations, especially those dedicated to unhealthy corporate factory farming practices. It would be vital for a company to distance themselves from that kind of activity by using only properly grown plants on healthy, environmentally sound plantations, and making that a very prominent part of their marketing. It would also be vital to play up everything possible that points to a healthy product by specifically mentioning those things about this specific product, not just general properties. This company doesn't do any of that, so I can only assume that this product is not produced in a way they want me to know about. That is the kiss of death for a product in my eyes. Granted, I am fussier than most in this regard. Don't be misled by the ""100% Natural"" marketing hype. That means virtually nothing. It is not a strict, legally defined standard, as is ""USDA Organic,"" for example. Virtually anything found in ""nature,"" i.e. toxic heavy metals, MSG (yes, it occurs in nature), animal manure, etc., can be considered ""natural"" and can legally be included in a product labeled ""100% Natural."" Granted, USDA organic standards are very weak as organic standards go (compared to say, Oregon Tilth), but they are still better than nothing. While I love coconut and want to give this product 4 or 5 stars, the complete lack of honest information about its origins and processing make me VERY, VERY suspicious. Without more information about how safe/healthy the product actually is, I can only give it 3 stars and a serious ""caveat emptor."" It is probably much better than any ordinary ""sports drinks,"" but there are too many unanswered questions to be sure. One's health is not something to be treated lightly. UPDATE July 2009: After continued searching, I still have not been able to locate a consistent source of organic or Fair Trade coconut water. While the manufacturer of this coconut water still does not give out any real information about the growing, harvesting, or other relevant details of production, neither do any of their competitors. So far, this is still the best coconut water I have been able to find, and I continue to drink it, even with the questions I have. …",491 out of 569 users found this review helpful
 Tasty but with a big drawback,2,"Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot. Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!! Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Superstore product description. Ouch! So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter. Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten. That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past. However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is ""imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources. We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west."" All that said, taste is pretty good and the ""wet"" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer). …",10 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 The price is NOT right,1,"As avid Keurig users - and Tassimo converts - we were thrilled to finally find Starbucks K-cups had arrived. I purchased 1 box of 16 K-cups for $21.90 - Pike's PlaceRoast - here on Superstore. And the taste didn't disappoint. We were very satisfied with it and feel it rivals the taste of a cup purchased at a Starbucks store. Unfortunately, the price also rivals that of a cup purchased at a Starbucks store. Here's the math. We have been drinking Caribou Blend coffees to this point. Caribou Blend on average = $0.67/cup Starbucks = $1.37/cup We understand that Starbucks is a ""premium"" coffee and don't expect it to be cheap. Caribou is also premium coffee and we can afford to by either. But on principle, suspecting Starbucks Corporate folks set the price, we've decided to stay with Caribou. Based on our household coffee consumption, we would pay a whopping $1,660.00/year more to have Starbucks. So we're going to vote with our $$ and stick with Caribou.

 Definitely much better than bouillon,5,"The non-organic version of this chicken base (available for around $4 at Wegmans' grocery stores in NY/NJ/PA) is a staple in my kitchen. I also use the beef, clam, and (vegetarian) vegetable bases and will never, ever go back to bouillon cubes. The taste is less salty than bouillon cubes and free of either the oxidized off-flavor of bouillon cubes and low salt bouillon powder packets, or the metallic ""tin can"" off-flavor of canned broths. Is one bouillon cube too little and two too much? With these you can add exactly what you need. The bases are very good on their own and especially good for extending, salting and ""filling out"" the fresh but uncomplicated taste of homemade stocks.

 Yum!,5,"I really like these protein bars! I found them at my local grocery store for $1.99 for a box. The major selling point for me was that there were no gluten containing ingredients on the label (not even oats). The label was extremely clear; for example, it listed ""rice maltodextrin"" rather than just maltodextrin - that way the consumer knows what the source of each ingredient is. The bars aren't marked as ""gluten free"" but I felt confident enough in the labeling that I was willing to take a chance on it, and it didn't make me sick so it turned out to be a good gamble! I'm always looking out for handy things I can grab and go, or keep in my purse or diaper bag, and this was just perfect. I will say it tastes like a protein bar, NOT like a granola bar or a candy bar. If you don't like protein bars in general, you might not like this.

 not the best for my cat,1,"I got this for my cat, thinking it was 'human grade', grain free, hence good for my cat. I realized the marketing is aimed at human sensibilities because it certainly looks and smells good enough for 'people' food. It may be great for some cats, but mine gained 2 lb since she's been eating this and I was feeding her much less than suggested. She also developed urinary problems. My vet who is one of the few vets who have studied nutrition, tried calling Weruva to find out more specifics about their food including calories, because many of her feline patients were eating Weruva and gaining considerable weight. The staff at Weruva would not talk to her or answer her questions and I couldn't guess why that would be unless their research has no real scientific backing to indicate this is a nutritious food. I tried calling them about week after that to see if they would tell me anything -- I got the same dismissive response. Pet food is not regulated and these smaller manufacturers can get one vet to review their ingredients and pay them off to say - 'hey this is a great, human-grade, grain free food'. While I've read the positive reviews about this food and some obviously find their cats love it, if your cat is gaining weight or developing urinary problems while on Weruva, think twice about buying it. …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Sweet Leaf vs. Better Stevia,5,"I bought this product for the first time 7 months ago. I bought Foods Stevia Liquid Extract Alcohol, 8 Ounce Bottle three months later. My motive was to compare these products and see which one is best for me. I will try to be as detailed as possible. So again I am evaluating ""Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme"" and ""Now Foods: Better Stevia Original"". At first, I expected Better Stevia to be what the packaging described, a better alternative to Stevia drinkers. I expected it to be exactly what they advertised in its packaging: -Better tasting -Just as healthy etc. To compare them, I alternated an average of 6 drops into my morning coffee everyday. ==Taste Evaluation== After everyday usage of these two products and after testing them extensively; I see no -significant- difference between the two in taste. Please do take into consideration that I did not test these by serving suggestion amount (see Suggested Serving below). ==Ingredients== Now let's talk about the ingredients. Both products claim to be made with natural ingredients. ""Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme"" lists ""natural flavors"" apart from ""Stevia extract"". ""Now Foods Better Stevia Original"" lists ""water"", ""certified Organic Stevia extract"" and ""11% alcohol"". Sweet Leaf has quite an advantage, since it does not list alcohol as an ingredient. I wanted more evidence about ingredients. I thought that Sweet Leaf was trying to pull as fast one, by passing alcohol as a ""natural flavor""; like many companies have done. So I visited the Sweet Leaf website and found this: ""SweetLeaf Stevia® Sweetener does not use chemicals, alcohols, solvents or enzymes at any stage of the extraction and purification process."" Bingo. Sweet Leaf has -no alcohol-. ==Suggested Serving and Packaging== ""Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme"" serving suggestion is 5 to 8 drops and contains a dropper for easier administration of the product. You can count exactly how many drops you're serving. As long as you don't go beyond 7-8 drops it should not be bitter at all. ""Now Foods Better Stevia Original"" serving suggestion is 1 to 4 drops and has a split-open cap that it's very messy. You can't count by drops, usually it spills to the body of the container. It is very difficult to measure exactly how much you're administering. I found that many times the bitterness was noticeable due to not knowing how much I was using. Final evaluation from 1 to 5. Taste: ""Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme"" = 5 ""Now Foods Better Stevia Original"" = 5 Ingredients: ""Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme"" = 5 ""Now Foods Better Stevia Original"" = 4 Suggested Serving and Packaging: ""Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme"" = 5 ""Now Foods Better Stevia Original"" = 2 All in all Sweet Leaf wins, for several reasons. The packaging makes it very easy to serve the product properly. When I used the Sweet Leaf dropper with the Better Stevia I found that 4 drops weren't bitter. But adding 8 drops of Better Stevia started to make my drink bitter. So Better Stevia claims it tastes better, as long as you follow their serving suggestion. Sweet Leaf tastes better otherwise. And to folks who really care about their alcohol intake for whatever reason; Sweet Leaf claims to have none. …",31 out of 42 users found this review helpful

 Nice bags but not as environmentally friendly as you might think.,3,"I did a lot of research before purchasing these bags. I looked at various brands of breastmilk storage bags as well as researching oxo plastics as I was unfamilar with them. From my research I ended up choosing purchasing over the lansinol ones. Why? 1. These have a reinforced bottom, lansinol do not. 2. The side seams are a lot thicker than the lansinol ones, so would presumably be stronger. 3. The biodragradable factor, this can only be a good thing right? While researching oxo plastics I discovered that oxo plastics are FDA approved and are safe for food storage and do not contain any BPA (lansinol bags are also BPA free). Oxo plastics can be manufactured to degrade quicker or slower depending on the manufacturers needs, therefore if you wish to compost them I would suggest contacting the manufacturer to find out the degradation time. That oxo plastics need oxygen to degrade so they would not degrade well in landfills as most landfills currently inoperation do not have an atmosphere conducive to biodegrading as they are so deep and compacted that there is not enough oxygen. But surely any amount of degradation is better than the alternative bags? After receiving the bags I conducted a few experiments with these bags and a few of the lansinol ones I had received in a couple of boxes of the lansinol disposable breastpads. Conclusions. 1. Apon examining the two different bags I noticed that the lansinol ones are marked with the reccyling symbol and the number 4. If you have access to recycling and are diligent in sorting your recyclables it would actually be better for the environment to use the lansinol ones. 2. I took one of each type of bag and stretched each bags seams and bottoms, neither bag gave way and seemed to still be in good condition. I then fill these bags with water, sealed them and then squeezed the bags to see if either would leak, the honeysuckle one did leak at the seem right underneath the zipper, the lansinol had not leaks. 3. I took two new bags, one of each type, and over filled them with 7oz of water in each. I then squeezed them to check the seams, neither leaked. I froze them flat and then thawed each in a seperate bowl, neither leaked during the freezing or thawing process. Both bags should hold up well to use following the maufacturers directions. If you have recycling in your area I would suggest the lansinol ones, if you do not have recycling then I would suggest the honeysuckle. Once I have used these up I will be switching to the lansinol ones. If you want more info about oxo plastics this website is quite informative. [...] …",44 out of 49 users found this review helpful
 Greenies are not digestible -your puppy will vomit and have diarrhea and will get very sick,1,"I made the mistake to give a Greeny to my puppy without reading reviews about this product. It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea. I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"". I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days. After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie! At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies. In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog. …",9 out of 19 users found this review helpful

Hot chocolate, chocolate ice cream, chocolate nut butters are all fabulous made with chocolate powder rather than highly processed cocoa powder. …",84 out of 85 users found this review helpful
 Acquired taste,5,"When I lived on the border of England and Wales, I had a roommate from Copenhagen Denmark, and he got some of this in his Christmas goodie basket from his Mom. At first it is a shock to the system, and I was the only American in the house that didn't spit it out. Soon I was bugging him to get his Mom to send more. It is a testament to the impression that it made that 25 years later I checked Superstore to see if I could get it here. Before I got home my wife and kids had gotten into the box and tried it. They didn't try a second piece. I however after the initial shock of the first piece, remembered why I liked it. And although this case will probably last me a long time, I do rather enjoy the flavor. But be warned the flavor is HEAVY on the salt and very light on the sweet. But it is a treat that you can enjoy without emptying the whole container in a sitting and wonder where it went. So... if you are adventurous, or if you remember the taste from your European adventures, try this exotic treat. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Cats LOVE this Dry Food.  Best Commercial Product List I've Found that in Reasonably Priced Commercial Pet Food. RECOMMENDED.,5,"I have 4 cats ranging in age from 2-10 years old. We previously fed them Iams Multi-Cat dry food which we purchased in 20lb bags at our local warehouse store. About 4 months ago, the warehouse store discontinued stocking Iams cat food, so I went looking for another, better quality dry cat food that was reasonably priced (my preference was to make my own cat food, but the reality is that I don't have time to do so). I stumbled on Castor & Pollux on Superstore & decided to give the blue bag (adult feline) a try. We've now gone through 27lbs of the adult feline dry food and like the Castor & Pollux dry food enough to make this our cat food of choice (so I have to remember to order ahead of time to not run out). We are now trying the green bag (indoor cat), so that review will come later after we go through a bag or 2 (15lb bags). Since it is not listed, and I wanted to know this information before I purchased, here is a full List of ingredients straight from the back of the blue bag: Chicken, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal, Menhaden Fish Meal, Ground Whole Grain Barley, Oat Groats, Brewers Rice, Chicken Fat preserved with Mixed Tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), Salmon Meal, Dried Egg Product, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dried Potatoes, Cultured Whey, Dried Carrots, Dried Bananas, Dried Apples, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ground Flaxseed, Sodium Bisulfate, Potassium Choloride, Salt, Dried, Blueberries, Dried Papya, Choline Chloride, Taurine, DL-Methionine, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (source of Vitamin C), Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, Copper Sulfate, Niacin, Vitamin A Supplement, Calcium Pantothenate, Manganous Oxide, Thiamine Mononitrate (source of Vitamin B1), Riboflavin Supplement (source of Vitamin B2), Pyridoxine Hydroxcholoride (source of Vitamin B6), Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Vitamin K1 Supplement, Sodium Selenite, Folic Acid, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Cobalt Caronate, Yeast Culture (Saccharomyes Cerevisiae), Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophuilus Fermentation Product, Dried Aspergillus Niger Fermentation Extract, Dried Trichoderma Longbrachiatum Fermentation Extract, Dried Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Extract and Fermentation Solubles. My older cats (8 & 10 yrs) had a hard transition from the Iams. We cleaned up a lot of carrot-filled cat vomit for the first 2 weeks. The younger cats transitioned with no issues whatsoever. We have since gone to the indoor feline and are not experiencing the daily upchucking (whether this is because they are already accustomed to the food or not, I don't know, but would assume that it plays a part). All cats love the food. We did find that they eat a little less of the Castor & Pollux, so maybe they are getting more quality with each bite. Iams uses by-product and Cator & Pollux uses meal, so I assume this may be the case. I did research on by-product vs meal & found the following information from various websites: Protein, in the form of quality meat ingredients, is the most important component of a pet's diet. As animals with a carnivorous background, their digestive tract is designed to utilize primarily meat and fat. It is also the most expensive ingredient for a manufacturer to buy and the profit margin on a product is drastically affected by the amount and quality used. Ideally, the first ingredient of a food should be either a specified meat meal, or a specified fresh meat type followed by a meal. Meat sources in ""meal"" form (as long as they are from a specified type of animal, such as chicken meal, lamb meal, salmon meal etc.) are not inferior to whole, fresh meats. ""Meal"" consists of meat and skin, with or without the bones, but exclusive of feathers/hair, heads, feet, horns, entrails etc. and have the proper calcium/phosphorus ratio required for a balanced diet. They have had most of the moisture removed, but remember that meats in their original, ""wet"" form still contain up to 75% water. Byproducts of any type are less desirable and only acceptable if they do not make up the main source of animal protein and if the name of the species used is also defined in some manner (e.g. ""chicken byproducts"" or ""beef byproducts"" but not ""meat byproducts"" or ""poultry byproducts""). Byproducts consist of anything but the quality cuts of meat. Castor & Pollux has a Pet & Soul Foundation that supports various pet organizations & charities. Look on their website & do the daily free kibble game to donate free kibble to pet shelters. All in all, I think that I could probably come up with a better homemade cat food, but, given time constraints and solid know-how, I think that this Caster & Pollux dry food is a good choice. My cats, all indoors, love the food, their fur is shiny & their skin appears to be healthy. We do not have dander issues & all the cats seem to be feisty & healthy. This is a reasonably priced dry food with a good list of ingredients as compared to other commercial foods. Castor & Pollux claim that they fully & unconditionally guarantee their food, so if you order & don't like it, you can call them. Best of all, Superstore ships it to my doorstep. RECOMMENDED. 10/3/11 (EDIT): I am still feeding my cats this food & they are doing well. I now supplement with a little wet cat food (have tried many brands/varieties & a still trying to find a ""hit"") daily, but the majority of their diet is this Castor & Pollux kibble. …",63 out of 64 users found this review helpful
 Boxed Mac 'N Cheese,4,"This may not be ""Kraft,"" but in my opinion it is better than the other gluten free mac 'n cheese mixes out there. It isn't terribly appropriate to compare it to a gluten box mix as those who buy this product do so because they CAN'T eat the gluten box mix. I like this product for a fast, tasty gluten free meal- I add coarse ground black pepper and vietnamese hot sauce, sometimes sprinkling chopped tomatoes and/or red peppers on top as a garnish. Of course homemade mac 'n cheese tastes better, but for a night when there's no time to do anything but turn on a burner and wait, this is a great product. (Amy's frozen mac n' cheese is also a winner- but avoid frozen glutino at all costs, yech.) …",31 out of 32 users found this review helpful

 Excellent unrefined sweetner; Pricey,4,"I have been in search of an unrefined sweetner to replace agave sweetner (for my baby's nut milk - dairy intolerance). I did the research, and this is it. The health benefits are fantastic. However, the price is so high I will unfortunately have to go back to raw agave sweetner. The taste is very similar to agave, a little less sweet, leans toward maple syrup but not as rich (a bonus in my book). My 3 year old and 1 year old both like the nut milk sweetened this way. Other down side, it takes almost twice as much as the agave to sweeten appropriately, though I haven't used for anything but nut milk. I think it's significantly better than brown rice syrup. If you have the money to support the ""habit,"" this is definitely the real deal. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Where has this stuff been all my life ? ?,5,"I cannot say how sorry I am that after 45 years of pie making, that I only discovered Clear Jel® this year. I consider myself a good cook, and my pie-making skills top notch, but I've had my fair share of pies turn out soupy or way too stiff with whatever I chose to thicken the filling with - flour, cornstarch, tapioca flour, arrowroot and others. Sometimes the amount I used was too much, sometimes too little, and leftover pies would ""weep"" in the refrigerator. I've made a half-dozen pies now using Clear Jel® for the thickener and, honestly, it seems to be foolproof. The first time I used it I made a picture-perfect marionberry pie that tasted as good as it looked. The filling didn't budge an inch after cutting the pie - it was firm without being stiff, with a soft and smooth mouth feel. Most important, not a single drop of juice ran. With no watery juice, the crust did not turn into a layer of purple mush; instead it remained a distinctly separate layer of flakey goodness. The vacant spots left on the pie plate after removing some slices were bare and dry - just a few crumbs from the crust. Where in the world has this stuff been all my life? The ""instant"" variety of Clear Jel® thickens without cooking, but that's not to say you can't use it to thicken something that gets cooked, like a pie. But if you plan to thicken something, say pie filling, and then preserve it by canning it in jars or freezing it for a long time, it's my understanding that the regular version is the one to use for that. The regular version achieves its thickening in the cooking process, but the instant variety thickens without cooking. Barry Farm Foods has some excellent, detailed information about Clear Jel® on their website - barryfarm(dot com) - where they provide equivalent measurements of Clear Jel® to exchange for other thickeners, and also explain the difference between the regular and instant varieties. King Arthur sells Clear Jel® in an 8-oz. package with their own label, and it's available on their website. I was able to find it at my local co-operative grocery store, but will get it here in the future, as it's a better deal. If you're concerned about the safety of this ""modified"" corn starch, ""modified"" in this case means ""pre-cooked"" or ""pre-gelatanized."" Nothing in the starch has been genetically modified. Made by National Food Starch, their GMO statement is available to read on their website - briefly, it says they use only non-GM regular (dent) corn products to make this starch. …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!,1,"Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned. ~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via Superstore subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that. Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered. Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this! I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can). Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell. How messed up is this? I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm. I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico. And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense. Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish! Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water. But I still miss old Zico. Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH. Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from Superstore, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH. 2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes ""just like"" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'. 3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on Superstore, so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is ""natural"" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo 4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to ""optimize"" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's ""optimized"" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to ""optimize."" (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under ""Todd O'Connor"". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor. Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified Superstore purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by ""Todd O'Connor"" and under Alio ""Alio""s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio ""Alio"" confirming the fake identity.) …",110 out of 124 users found this review helpful

 Truly much better than bullion!,5,"I found this product in a gourmet grocery store, and since I like to make sauces, but don't have the time usually to do it from scratch, I tried it. I taste tested it against three different canned and boxed stocks I have used, and it was better. Depending on the concentration you mix it to, it is always chickeny, just a hint of sweet, and looks just like regular stock. I have even tried putting a quarts worth of the concentrate into a cupful of sauce and it doesn't make it salty, just taste richer, and it doesn't seem to affect the chemistry of sauces, thick or thin, no extra tendency to break. I have since tried all the other flavors with equal success. These are great for gourmet camp cooking too, and can be used any where you need a stock but don't want ot haul all the weight and bulk. Makes great soups too, friends and family rave about my Greek Avgolemeno soup which only uses this as the stock, along with some orzo, lemon, egg and diced cooked chicken. …",33 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 Not a Bad Fat Anymore,5,"Excellent product!! I have found that coconut oil can be used in any way you would use oil or butter. It has a very mild coconut flavor----nothing that would really alter the taste of what you're preparing. It can take high heat cooking without breaking down. (All the benefits of olive oil are destroyed with high heat). It doesn't need refrigeration----another plus. Tastes great on toast. Too bad the good things about coconut oil have been surpressed for so many years. It seems to be one of the healthy fats instead of all the synthetics (e.g. margarine) and hydrogenated products on the market.

" Good texture, flat flavor",3,"I had high hopes for this gluten-free bread mix, and although it had many good qualities, I probably wouldn't buy it again because I didn't care for the flavor. I made it in my breadmaker and it rose nicely and held its shape reasonably well after I took it out of the machine. I let the bread cool before I cut it as all gluten free bread can fall if cut while hot, and the bread sliced very well. Each individual slice had a spongy, soft bread texture. Actually it was almost a little TOO soft for me, but those who like soft bread might enjoy it. I cut a slice and put margarine and honey on it, expecting to have a tasty bite of fresh bread- but something about the flavor bothered me, and I had difficulty enjoying it. I have had almost every kind of gluten-free bread on the market and have been gluten free for a long time, but I don't know how I feel about this new Sorghum craze. Although it yields decent nutritional value and good texture, similarly to bean flour, if there is too high of a ratio of sorghum to neutral flours (White rice, tapioca, etc.) I think that the flavor is negatively impacted. I prefer a more subtle mix, like Bette Hagman's four flour blend, which has less sorghum and thus gets the good qualities of the flour without negatively impacting flavor. I toasted the bread for sandwiches for a few days and my husband ate it without complaint (he is not gluten-free), but because I didn't like the bread and it reminded me a little of playdough, I don't think I'll buy it again. My entirely subjective opinion aside, if you are looking for an easy gluten-free bread mix for your machine, I would recommend that you try this mix, because only trial and error will help you find a bread mix that suits your palate. I prefer homemade bean flour blends, Bob's red Mill GF bread, or The gluten free Pantry's favorite sandwich bread, but you may find this mix fits the bill perfectly! One other note- Most of the 99 reviews listed for this item are actually NOT for this specific mix- they are for the full spectrum of Pamela's products on Superstore. So, while people like this mix- 99+ people have not (yet) rated this item. …",81 out of 88 users found this review helpful

I used some to prepare a pasta sauce, and was very impressed with the aroma when I fried the garlic, and even more impressed when I tasted the end result.

 Poor customer service,1,"I ordered both xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very, very strange, foul smell. Kinda like mothballs. They get some of their products made in China (the erythritol, apparently), so I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination. I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund just for the strange smelling items (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable). She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again. Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one of the same thing since I'd never ordered from them before. (Note: I only wanted a refund for the unopened bags of the item in question. I did not ask to return anything else in the order.) I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same. Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site. While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me. I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc. Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried. I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective. NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar. They are also available here on Superstore . Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on. --------------------------------- -I ordered a wide variety of things, including this item: erythritol, xylitol, gum, candy, etc. It included this item and a lot of other things. -I asked only for money back on items I tried that were suspect as being defective, and then only for the items I had not opened. -I asked the manufacturer if the items were safe to consume, given the very odd odor some of them emitted. -My review concerns primarily the customer service problems I had, as well as the concern with the origin of their products I had ordered in general. Personally I think it is odd that when I called to return a small part of a rather large order that the customer service rep did not want to honor the guaranteed refund posted on the web site. She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing. How was I to know the substance would smell so badly? She said I should have just ordered one. What difference does it make since I had only opened one? The others were perfectly sealed. She said she would take them back after much ado, and then said they would never accept another order from me. (Like I would anyway after that). I stand by my post. If you have had a good encounter with their customer service, I am happy for you. That was not my experience. They should not post a guaranteed refund when they don't mean it. …",39 out of 41 users found this review helpful

 safety instructions,5,"All NovoAndina Products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags. NovoAndina products do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored.

Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Our teas are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas.

 Jerky Chicken,3,"All of my dogs LOVE this product, however, with the recent recall and problems that have occurred with this product and others just like it (different brand names) I am sorry to say that my dogs started to get sick when they would eat these. I contacted my vet who insisted that I stop giving my dogs these treats immediately. She stated that these, and others, were on a recall due to a chemical that was used in China. Yes, these are made in China and I did not know this until I received the product and after the vet brought it to my attention. If you can find this type of product, but NOT made in China, then it should be okay to give to you dog. I am still looking for one that is not made in China, because my dogs truly did love this product to have as a treat. Contact your vet before giving your dog any kind of treat like this. I am now giving my dogs a jerkey duck treat, and so far so good. None of them have gotten sick. I am sadden by all of the problems we are having with our dog food and dog treats coming from China.

Besides that it is in the same category of Dunkin Donuts, not more not less and that is not saying much.

 Ekobrew Washer Hack,4,"When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good. I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer. If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past. The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer. The washer I used is rubber, 1/16"" thick, 5/32"" inside diameter, and 3/8"" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493. …",232 out of 235 users found this review helpful
" Very tasty, changed recipe a bit",5,I've used it three times so far and it was great all three times and it makes outstanding leftovers (I used 3 packets at once last time!). I added the spice packet two times but I wasn't all that thrilled with bitting into bits and pieces of the various parts while I ate. So the last time I made it I first started with the butter and added the spice packet (simmer according to instructions). Next I added 1.5 cups of water then I let this simmer. Next I prepared the veggies. The first time I didn't use the lemon curd as instructed. The second time I did. The third time I used plain yogurt (6oz per packet). The lemon was my least favorite and the yogurt was my most favorite. After about 30 minutes of simmering the spice packet (when the veggie prep was done) I strained the water/spice mix into the veggies. Then I followed the recipe to the end. …,24 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 Deceptive labeling for glorified peanut bars,1,"I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description. It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond, walnut and macadamia, especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list. Maybe they think that people can't tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts? I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK, but I have a hard time believing that the 4.5 star rating the product currently receives hasn't been created by company shills. It is a shame too, since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description.

" Not only saves $$$ ... It's tasty, terrific, healthy and easy!",5,"We're suffering a heat wave, and it was a sweltering 103 degrees here yesterday. Since my air conditioner went out and the repairman couldn't come until Monday, my daughter Allie decided to get me out of the heat ... a drive to see some friends, followed by a nice dinner in a cool, relaxing restaurant. The ac in her car felt like Heaven, so after I got comfortable, I reached for my water bottle. When I did, Allie handed me this tiny packet (resembled an elongated version of those packets of salt in fast-food places), instructing me to pour it into my water. She knew I liked Crystal Light lemonade, so thought I would like this too. My bottle held 16.9 ounces of water and since I had already drunk half, it was perfect for eight ounces of this delicious drink. I tapped the powder into the water, swirled the bottle to mix it well, then took a sample sip. I liked it so well, I gulped with gusto. I've always appreciated the health benefits of green tea and the flavor of mangos, so it was a no-brainer that I'd like this tasty beverage. How well my daughter knows me! Allie nodded when I told her I had never seen these tiny packets, since the lemonade had come in small tubs that made an entire pitcher, and she laughed when I raved over the convenience and ease of use, marveling at the genius of the manufacturer. When I came on-line to order this viitamin-enhanced green tea peach mango mixture and the lemonade for the kids, I did some quick math, realizing that when mixed with filtered tap water, the price per eight ounces is thirty-two and one-quarter cents a bottle. I prefer the 16-oz. bottles, so I use two of these packets, which figures to be sixty-four and a-half cents. ... Much cheaper than soda--and decidedly tastier and healthier! I ordered this mixture for myself and lemonade flavor for my grandchildren. Johnny doesn't like water too much, so hogs every bottle of soda that we buy. I plan to give him his own supply to take to school because they fit so easily into his pocket and are so easy to mix on the run. One final tip Allie passed on: Some of her friends simply add a half- or fourth-packet, preferring a milder refreshing. Sounds good to me! Thanks, Allie ... not only for treating me to dinner but for introducing me to a healthy new taste treat, one that I can mix on the go!

 I wish I had found this earlier,5,"I discovered Beet Juice when I went to Whole Foods in search of a natural source of Iron. I was eight months pregnant at the time and anemic and I have a terrible time taking synthetic iron without throwing up. Anyway, I went in looking for something and the clerk told me this was the best source. I took her word for it and took these home, and I'm glad I did. These are awesome! Within a few days of taking this I felt remarkably better. I did a bit of reading about the benefits of beet juice, and there's not much it isn't good for. Its really considered a super food its so potent as an antioxident. It is also remarkable for vein support, regulating blood sugar and blood pressure. It is also good for replacing blood after surgery and it is a powerful anticancer food. It also is really high in fiber so it counteracts the usual problem associated with taking iron--constipation. The great thing about taking the supplement is there is no way you can eat enough beets to get all these benefits, so supplementing is the way to go!! I took these on a empty stomach before bed and it never bothered my stomach. Don't hesitate to try these. In the capsule form these are easy to swallow and much cheaper than synthetic iron pills. I'm still taking them because of all the health benefits they offer. …",29 out of 29 users found this review helpful

" Great taste, extremely convenient, good size serving",5,"I purchased this item first at my local Giant just to try, it was a bit pricey at $3.50/each. I tried it and I was immediately hooked. I do really like tuna and the tuna found in this product is very good, the pieces are firm and not all mashed up and turned into paste.

I am a university student and my eating habits are especially bad. I often skip breakfast and don't eat a lunch until after 4 pm. Since a microwave is not readily accessible to me the fact that this tastes GREAT without heating is a huge plus. I am an extremely picky eater and I found this to be very tasty and convenient. The fact that this item is vacuum sealed and does not contain any preservatives is also a plus. The included spork is quite sturdy and it is individually wrapped and there is also a sachet of ""Orange & Acacia Honey"" that is included which I don't think is mentioned in the product description.

 Don't buy for Feline Pine litter,1,"This would be a great litter box for some litters, especially with the double bottom trays that make cleaning easier. However, contrary to a previous review, I found this box bad for Feline Pine wood pellet litter. The slots in the top sifting pan are exactly the same size as the Feline Pine pellets, so pellets block most slots. In addition, the top sifting pan does not sit sufficiently high above the pan below it. Both lead to powder piling up very quickly in the top pan, defeating part of the purpose of Feline Pine. If you use Feline Pine (and I recommend that highly) Pine Original Cat Litter, 40-Pound Bags , buy the box made specifically for it, sometimes offered on Superstore but, if not, at [...].

 Warning: Contains Menadione,1,"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex. Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance. Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption. A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997. Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells. Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats. …",20 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 New formula,1,"My dogs have been on Canidae for the past several years and even the picky dog who has lost over half her teeth loved it. However, I recently bought a new bag of Canidae. The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula. I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it. The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything. I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat. NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags. Their response: ********* Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas. ********* I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it.

" Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me",5,"I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store. I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie. In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion. Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me. This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber. While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar. Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

Although I am not 100% raw, I am trying to exchange as many foods as I can. These nibs are crunchy--but not rock hard crunchy. Do not look to compare this to processed, cooked chocolate that is full of sugar. These nibs are not ""candy"" but a healthy food. Dipped in a little agave syrup( a honeylike , low glycemic index, organic sweetener that is delicious) or honey, one would have a candy like snack. Since they are not a processed food full of sugar, they are more bitter than chocolate but they are not by any means too terribly bitter to enjoy.

 It changed my life!,5,"East Cape Manuka Honey is incredible! It's fantastic for a variety of uses: 1) a spoonful approx. 20 minutes before meals seems to drastically reduce the chances of suffering gastro-intestinal distress (such as from IBS or other upset); 2) I haven't been sick with any colds or flu since consuming one or more spoonfuls a day even when repeatedly exposed to sick friends, family and co-workers so I believe it boosts the immune system; 3) as a facial or spot treatment vs. acne (adult or teenager), this honey rapidly speeds healing of existing acne and prevention of future outbreaks; it also leaves my skin smooth and tight; 4) as a rapid wound healer, there is nothing better I've found in nature or science. For me, it works faster and better than any OTC antibacterial cream, from reducing pain signals to promoting actual healing. One tiny 2.5 oz. jar lasts me about 4-6 weeks of conservative daily use. The honey has a smoky, somewhat medicinal flavor that isn't very good but isn't bad, either. You get used to it. After all, the results are worth it! Be warned, not all honeys are created equal. Only New Zealand Manuka Honey with a UMF rating is legit because it is tested and certified by the New Zealand government to have the correct ""Unique Manuka Factor"" rating and purity. The reason New Zealand Manuka Honey is so powerful is the bees feast on the New Zealand Manuka tea tree plant (which is ten times more powerful than its Australian cousin). This results in their honey being loaded with antibacterial properties! Because Manuka Honey is rare and expensive, a large number of fakes are available that claim to be ""bio-active"" or ""UMF equivalent"" to whatever UMF number (12+, 15+, etc.). These knock-offs do contain some Manuka Honey but are not 100% pure; they are cut with other honeys which make it cheaper to produce and less effective. Yet many will charge the same price as the real deal for this inferior product hoping customers won't know the difference! I've tested regular store-bought American honey vs. a ""bio-active 15+"" knock-off Manuka Honey vs. the ""real deal"": East Cape Manuka Honey UMF 20+. The American honey had minor benefits, the knock-off Manuka brand offered a clear improvement (2-3 times better than American honey) but was still not strong enough. However, the East Cape UMF 20+ gave me results that were right off the chart! I won't settle for anything less now. To combat acne: You should wash first with Honey Propolis Soap . Apply the honey directly as a spot treatment or all over as a mask once or twice daily and leave on for 30-60 minutes, then wash off with cold water. When I first began using Manuka Honey, I had quick results but like anything, you have to stick with it or the acne comes back. If the honey doesn't get rid of your acne completely (like me, although it did do an amazing job of reducing it), you should also try Oil 100% Pure East Cape 10ml/0.34oz (again, you should wash first with Honey Propolis Soap ), maybe alternating between the oil and the honey masks once each per day (whatever combination works best for you). The oil is even stronger and more concentrated than the honey; some people may find it too strong when applied directly. If this is you, then you can try 2-3 drops diluted in a solution of water and/or witch hazel. The oil is also handy for healing minor wounds like hangnails, paper cuts or cat scratches; I place a drop directly on the wound several times a day and it works like a charm. The only downside to the oil is it has a strong medicinal odor (not awful but not good) so I wouldn't use it right before leaving the house or inviting friends over. It might also sting a little when it first goes on but this should vanish within a few minutes. Note that the higher the UMF rating, the stronger the antibacterial properties. For therapeutic uses such as mentioned above, I wouldn't go with less than UMF 15+ but prefer 20+. Natural Solutions/East Cape makes both and there are other brands that are also UMF-certified but I haven't tried them. All of my Manuka orders have been through Koru Naturals and they have been lightning fast to ship and quick to respond to emails (they've also securely packed my honey each time to avoid breakage in transit). Koru also offers a nice selection of other healthcare items from New Zealand (lanolin, etc.). One final word: I'm not a doctor. I'm not offering medical advice. Different sites offer different treatment suggestions (which I encourage you to read and consider before use). I can't guarantee Manuka will work miracles for you but I know it did for me! Both my MD and naturopath proved useless in diagnosing or treating my skin problems; problems that had plagued me for nine years. Only Manuka proved effective and I'd tried everything from prescription drugs to diet changes. Your results may vary but if you suffer from any of the problems I've mentioned above and nothing else has worked, you owe it to yourself to at least try Manuka. It changed my life! …",45 out of 49 users found this review helpful
