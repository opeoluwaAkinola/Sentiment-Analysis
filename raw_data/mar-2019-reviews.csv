 I love Himalayan salt,5,I will never use regular salt again. It is tasty and strong. They say it is pristine and has lots of trace minerals in it. I hope that is true.

 Zoe Diva Select Oilive Oil In Plastic Bottle,1,"I was very disappointed to receive what I thought would be a quality olive oil in a glass bottle, instead it is in a Plastic bottle. I urge buyers not to buy this product as plastic introduces cancer causing chemicals into the oil, specifically if exposed to heat. Additionally, plastic is ruining the environment as it never breaks down, and is essentially a permanent stain on mankind for unnecessarily ruining the environment.

 MRSA gone with Manuka honey!,5,"My mother contracted MRSA through a pressure sore at a hospital. No antibiotic can ever get rid of MRSA, it kept coming back and the bedsore getting worse. We bought the MGO 400 Manuka honey, started putting in the wound and in all MRSA sores, the next day there was a significant improvement over all. Now, it's been 5 days, the pressure sore is almost completely healed and the MRSA has not come back like it did on a daily basis, there is nothing but beautiful skin, no sores, no redness. IT'S A MIRACLE! Praise God for the Manuka plant, for honey bees and for this wonderful discovery. Now I read it's also good for arthritis so I am going to start using it on my mother's knees which have very bad pain from arthritis. I recommend this as a miracle honey for many uses, it is also USDA approved for wound care, any kind of wound. …",63 out of 66 users found this review helpful

" Outstanding, Bold, Lively Sumatran. best of the K-cups",5,"First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine. Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being ""tangy"" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich. IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4. I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc. Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star. Stale and bitter. I will definitely stay with Puck's. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Food Should Taste Good ....,5,"... and these do!! Wow! I was really surprised at how good these chips are. These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there. The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right. They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips. Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt. Not these. An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium. For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts. Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack. Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges? These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers. Yum!! I'll definitely be purchasing these from Superstore -- I've never seen them in the stores, and I simply must have more of them! …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Very tasty,4,"The sticky rice is perfect, just microwave it in the container it comes in for 2 min. The paper thin wraps are very small and it is a bit difficult to roll. The result is a bit of a mess but tastes great. I put a small amount of crab meat next to the rice. Each pack comes with 10 wraps, a container of rice, and one soy sauce pack. The calorie count is 340. But with 1/2 it is a reasonable 170 and is enough for a lunch. I bought it when it was a gold box item for $10. It is worth that, but I will not purchase again for a higher price. Overall it is easy to make, tastes great and is a great option to have around since it does not require any refrigeration. …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful

" Warning, non-diet syrup contains Sucralose (Splenda)",3,"This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener. I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar. It does, in fact, contain real sugar. But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose. I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a ""half diet"" drink. But I don't like diet drinks. I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste. I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then. So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners. I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream. I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product. They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups. It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose. …",30 out of 38 users found this review helpful
" A bit different, and wonderful",5,"These peppercorns are a beautiful rosy color, which clues you in before you even get a chance to open the package that they're not the peppercorns you've known all your life. When you do pull open the bag and inhale their aroma, you'll find they combine the scent of pepper with a wonderful fruity, almost floral overtone. It's hard to describe, and even harder to imagine until you've experienced it. The lovely part is that the flavor profile doesn't diminish in use; when I ground and steeped these Sichuan peppercorns for a dark chocolate mousse (grind finely, and steep in the heavy cream for 30 minutes before straining the cream into the chocolate) their vibrant peppery fruit/floral scent was the top note of the mousse. It was a memorably different flavor. Now I'm looking for ways to add them to more dishes, to see what new nuances they can impart to old favorites. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Very very tasty snack,5,"Attracted by the packaging, I purchased a bag [of the Classic Sea Salt flavor] in a local 'gourmet market'. At 110 calories, I suspected that I had been, as frequently happens, fooled by the 'serving size' (you know how it goes, 2.5 pieces = a 'serving' - so there are actually 7 'servings'/bag) BUT, NO, what a pleasant surprise - 110 calories was for the WHOLE delicious bag! They're non-greasy, light as a feather and unexpectedly filling - I almost couldn't finish the bag. I noticed they were produced here in NY, which I also liked and, after going online to find out more about them, decided to splurge for a case [of 1 oz. bags] to try all the varieties. One ounce doesn't sound like very much but they are so light that it is actually a very full bag and definitely more than enough for a single serving. (The 3 oz. bag contains substantially more then you would want for just one person) Favorites so far are: Honey Mustard & Onion Vintage Cheese Classic Sea Salt I don't have kids but I expect these would work extremely well as a lunch box addition. My only suggestion to the company would be that it might be a good idea if they made them available for purchase in smaller quantities. I'm afraid many people will be put off by having to purchase in 12- & 24-bag sized cases. But, if you do decide to purchase, I also have no doubt that you'll have no trouble sharing them with friends and will probably be back for more sooner than you expected. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 My dog is obsessed with this ball,5,"I went on Superstore looking for some type of dog chew or hard food that would take a long time for my dog to get through, but not so hard that she would give up. She's about 25 pounds, active, but won't play with any toys, and can get down a rawhide in ten minutes. I wanted to find something to cut into her boredom and downtime, but not add a lot of calories. The first day I put it together (took about one minute) and rolled it across the floor. She slowly took after it, investigated, and I went to make dinner. I enjoyed my first dinner at home in about a year that didn't involve my dog staring at me hoping for a handout. She just obsessed over the ball, licking it, and grinding at it with her teeth. After dinner I checked it, and she had made what appeared to be almost negligible progress on the treat. We watched a movie in peace (other than this constant weird panting/slurping noise from the other room). At some point, we realized she had been working on this thing for about three hours. My wife checked her mouth, she was afraid her gums would be bleeding or that her teeth would be ground down to the gums. But no sign of damage. We took it away from her and put it on top of the fridge, and she sat there staring up at the fridge for about half an hour. I'm now on my third day, about three hours a day, still working on the first two discs that fit on opposite sides of the ball. I think maybe she's gotten through about half of it. She's actually penetrated one of the discs with a hole that goes all the way through. She's obsessed. While she has it, she doesn't want to do anything else. If I go to pet her (which she normally loves) she treats me as an irritant keeping her from her ball. Want to walk (normally her favorite thing)? Nope. Maybe after I'm done with this ball in another 16 hours I'll walk. I wonder how long she would be on this ball if I let her? Her jaws must be cramping up. I get the feeling I could give it to her, go to bed, and wake up to see her with bloodshot eyes still working on the ball. It's like crystal meth for dogs. Oh my god, while I'm writing this my dog accidentally rolled the ball under a table and she can't get to it. She looks like an alcoholic staring at a drink they can't reach. I actually feel sorry for her. It's almost 9pm and she's been on this thing since 6pm. Anyway, for my dog, this was exactly what I was looking for. I give it 5 stars. …",24 out of 24 users found this review helpful

" The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization",5,"Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet. Yes they really are that good. I'm not in thrall of the whole ""organic"" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil. The person who came up with this ""red hot"" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented. It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head. It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.

 Simple as it gets,5,"EDIT: I found an even better way to work this stuff. Read on for good tips. Buy TWO (or more) bottles of the same juice. Apple or peach grape are good options. Let one ferment out dry...takes about a week. Then, pour about 75% out into a pitcher. Refill the original container with fresh juice. Put the vapor lock back on...you've created Batch #2. Pour the pitcher of dry alcoholic juice into the new container (with 25% juice). Squeeze the bottle to remove the rest of the air. Re-install the lid. Wait 24-48 hours until the bottle is stiff again and then refrigerate. Drink and enjoy perfectly sweet/dry/carbonated spiked juice. The advantages? 1. No worrying about how long it'll take to ferment. You can run your first bottle dry and then add the fresh juice right before the weekend to prime the carbonation. You can leave the first bottle with vapor lock in a finished fermentation state for days/weeks without issue. 2. You control the sweetness/dryness. Vary the mix ratio to suit your taste. 3. You control the carbonation. Adjust the refrigeration and/or vent carbonation to avoid overpressure. (Squeezing out all the air helps prevent oxidation). 4. You get cleaner drink. The yeast drops out of suspension and is left in the next batch. 5. YOU REUSE THE YEAST AND SAVE MONEY! Do this just once per batch and you cut your cost by 50%. Plus the next batch starts up quicker than if you'd pitched new yeast. As a side note, this yeast is particularly well-suited for this task. I tried some white wine yeast once and it turned my apple juice into a STINKY ROTTEN EGG SULFUR BOMB! No kidding....the yeast got all stressed out and burped sulfur. Yuck. This yeast has never let me down in 10-20 batches. Original Review: Wow, this stuff is fun. Thankfully, it comes in double kits so you can experiment faster ( or make twice as much) without waiting. Go grab a variety of 64oz 100% juice bottles from Trader Joes. I've tried pear cider and blackberry so far...and both worked great. Or save some money and get apple juice or peach grape from Walmart. Choose your poison. Check it after 2 days. You'll probably want to go 3 or 4 days to get rid of a good amount of sugar and get enough alcohol. But check it daily after that, as the fermentation will be geometrically faster as the yeast multiply. After 4 days, you'll probably have a much drier taste...too dry for some. I use a strainer to filter out the largest chunks of dead yeast, but they won't hurt you. And I left the cap on in the fridge to have the residual yeast carbonate the drink. Yes, I was risking explosion, but it tastes MUCH better. And the cold temperature slows the fermentation...just check the bottle rigidity twice a day. If it's too stiff, HAVE A DRINK! The nice thing is, it'll repressurize itself a bit, unlike soda that goes flat after you open it. Give it a try....you can't go wrong. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
" Good tea but pricey pouches, with enough for a cup, not pot!",2,"Mighty Leaf have positioned themselves at the high end of the tea bag market, sorry, I mean tea 'pouch' market. They do deliver good teas, but firstly they are extremely expensive - its close to 50c per bag (!)and secondly some flavors have just enough tea in the bag for a single cup, not a one person pot. Ginger Twist is like that, try and make a small pot for one, and you'll end up with flavored water. So what? well any high end tea maker should be aiming for the small pot (a tea pot is essential for quality tea drinking!) and regardless if you agree with that or not, at these prices you simply should be getting enough to make a small pot for one, without using 2 bags.

 NOT DIGESTABLE AND CAUSE DEATH OR SERIOUS ILLNESS,1,"SADLY, I FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY THAT THESE MOO BULLY STICKS ARE NOT 100% DIGESTIBLE! MY DOG ALMOST DIED AFTER A PIECE DID NOT DISSOLVE IN HER STOMACH.My 3 dogs loved these Moo Bully sticks. I was buying them and giving them because I felt it might causes a chocking danger. I always had plenty of water close by. One day I noticed my dog,Lily, was having very loose stools and that were jelly like in consistency.This same day she stopped eating and began vomiting.I immediately rushed her to my veterinarian.Upon his physical exam he noted that her abdomen was hard and distended.He wanted me to leave her with him so he could do a x-ray. He did and found that she had a bloackege in her stomach!He then started a series of Barium x-rays to watch the blockage to see if it was going to pass. Over a 4 hour period of watching and repeating these barium x-rays it not only showed that the blockage was not passing, but the ""item"" causing the blockage was swelling in size, absorbing the stomach fluids.I was told he had to do emergency surgery to get this blockage out of her ASAP. What he found in her stomach was most definitely a piece of the Moo Bully stick! It had not digested as claimed by the manufacture if swallowed.My veterinarian told me if he had not brought Lily in as promptly as I did,to remove this blockage, she most definitely would have died!He told me that this was not 100% digestible as the manufacture had claimed it to be . If it had been, it would have dissolved in her stomach! lily had major abdominal exploratory surgery that lasted over 3hours, to remove this piece the piece of Moo Bully stick !She was hospitalized afterwards for 4 nights and 5 days. She almost did not make. Lily refused eat for 5 days. She therefore lost a lot of weight,became very frail and lethargic. Thank god, my veterinarian was fabulous.He was so concerned for Lily, that he actually stayed by her side at night,every night making sure he did everything he could to pull her through this.Once home she was weak and could barely walk. I tried to get her to eat and she refused. I was offering her cooked chicken liver and even this did not even entice her to eat. Finally, the next day, she did begin to nibble on some food. It was a very slow healing process and took Lily over a month until she was herself again.The thought of losing Lily tore me apart. Watching the pain and suffering she went though cannot be put into words.I felt so helpless. It was nothing but a pure hell that she and I went though for weeks on end.I was also feeling so guilty because I gave her the MOO Bully stick.You see, I only feed my dogs the very best, high quality organic dog foods. I never ever ever would give my dogs anything that was not the best and the safest. I never gave my dogs raw hide chewies or greenies( Any dog owner that cares about the welfare of their a dog knows how dangerous and deadly these products are) I started giving my dogs the Moo bully sticks because everything I had read and researched lead me to believe not only were they safe, 100% DIGESTIBLE, but that they came from Brazil cattle that only grazed on non chemically treated grass, were not feed any hormones and drank from fresh natural spring water.There was nothing harmful in this product. So I stared giving my dogs these MOO bully sticks.I am a very dedicated,caring, responsible animal lover and owner. I wrote letters to the companies I purchased the Moo Bully sticks form as well as the manufacturer. Only one retailer responded to my letter by referring me to the manufacturer.The manufacturer of these Moo Bully Sticks, "" Free Range Dog Products "" totally ignored both of my certified letters. So many owners have no clue that their dogs may have become sick or died due to a piece of a Bully stick that did not digest. What if their vet missed the symptoms? What if they never took their dog to a vet after becoming ill and the dog died? What if they never discovered what killed their dog? Not everyone can afford to pay for surgery on their dogs, x-rays,lab work,medicines,and a hospital stay. My vet bill was almost $5,000.00 My vet even discounted most of what he did, as well not charge me for everything.In fact, he he felt so bad, that he did not charge me for staying by her side for all through the night, on those 4 nights. What if a dog died or got very ill when ingesting a piece of these Bully sticks and never came forth to inform the public ? Maybe mine is the very first case? But all it should take is one, to satisfy anyone not to ever buy this product and give it their beloved dogs.

 Fair Warning,1,"Especially for this price, I expected this product to arrive in the famous white box with the individual cups and the map in the lid, NOT loose in a brown cardboard box with a scrap of white wax paper between the tape and the loose jelly beans. No ziplock bag, not even cheap clear plastic bag, just the brown cardboard box (the outside was white). Yes, the website says to read everything carefully. No, there is no picture of a Jelly Belly box. I just had my own expectations, and I wanted to give you my opinion. Good luck. …",19 out of 25 users found this review helpful
 Amazing!,5,"My vet had recommended Royal Canin for my older cat because he had slight tartar buildup and because I was told it would lower the p.H. of his urine. Unfortunately, it was over $30.00 for an eight-pound bag, it smelled awful, and it contained by-products. Next, I tried Nutro, but I was shocked at some of the things I read about the product (such information can be found via a Google search). Finally, I picked up some Wellness, which was much less expensive than the vet's stinky stuff, having read multiple raves about the product. As soon as I opened up the bag of Wellness, my two fellas darted towards me. They scarfed down the Wellness, ignoring the Nutro in their bowls. The cats did not have any digestive problems, and they continued to ignore the other food, so after a few days, I simply gave them Wellness. Needless to say, they absolutely love it. One time, I left the bag open on the counter while I went to refill their water bowls. I heard a strange chomping sound intermingled with rustling, and turned around-- I could only see the behind of my older cat, as he was shamelessly snacking from the bag of Wellness! And my two boys look absolutely amazing. Their soft fur is so shiny that it sparkles under the light! They have not had any issues with this food at all. Every time I come home or wake up, their bowls are always empty; my younger cat has even tried to lick his empty bowl in vain for any crumbs. I won't be using any other products. Wellness is a little pricey, but our furry friends deserve nothing but the best. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Best Gum Ever!!!,5,"Bottom line: buy this gum....in bulk....because you will love it!! I am a dedicated patron of Juicy Fruit, but saw this gum at the gas station the other day. As with the previous reviewers, I was skepical at first, assuming that this was just a marketing ploy and that it would taste like any of the many peppermint or spearmint gums already on the market (which I don't particularly love). But the picture of the ice cream on the front of the box was compelling, so I decided to risk it. It SERIOUSLY DOES taste like mint chocolate chip ice cream. No kidding, it is just like eating a bowl of ice cream (I also think the flavor is somewhat reminiscent of Thin Mints). Now, I feel like I'm eating 3 or 4 bowls of ice cream per day, for a grand total of 20 calories. And do not just take my word for it: I recently was at a gathering of a few co-workers and all of them tried it and were quite impressed as well. I'm sure they will be posting a review any day also.

 Cat loves the flavor,5,"Kitty loves it! Happily eats 1/2 can in one setting (13.5 lbs cat), 2-3 times a day. His fur does look fluffier after 2 months on this food and he seems more content and alert. Wet food does make him urinate more (he used to get a dry/wet mix of Urinary SO prescription diet), but I am glad, because this should help to keep his urinary tract healthy. I researched various options before settling on this one. Among other brands (wet food only), he wouldn't even touch ""Organix;"" he likes ""Evo"" fine, but not as much as Newman's own and leaves one-third of food uneatten in the bowl. As far as other flavors of Newman's own, he didn't like the Brown rice flavor (too much rice--the cat kept picking out individual grains out of his food one by one), and strangely, after eating a few cans of store-bought Chicken&Salmon flavor, he refused to eat the same flavor from Superstore. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Packed in Puree is what You Want to See,5,"After moving to the South from the Northeast, finding good products to cook food from my Italian heritage has been hard. I haven't been able to find a substitute for my beloved Redpack tomatoes. We buy those by the box up North, but that company doesn't distribute in the South. After some research I found the label difference was ""packed in Puree"". Most other brands are packed in tomato juice, and that makes a watery, inferior sauce. ""Purea di Pomodoro"" - that's what I want to see! But when I saw this brand, I saw the magic words and gave it a try. In fact, last night I cooked up a big pot of sauce and brought it over to my Southern neighbors, and it was a hit! It short, this Brooklyn born Southerner recommends this product, especially to those who are out of the area of the usual Northeastern brands. I just wish Superstore would put this on their subscribe and save - I use four cans each time I make a pot so getting this regularly to my door would be great. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Consistant basic Mexican hot Chocolate you can dress up,4,"First off - this is not an ""instant' product the way most americans expect Hot Cocoa products to be. It comes in cakes and must be ground either with a mortar & pestle or in a very sturdy grinder/blender. It is a basic recipe which suits the majority. Therefore, if you want it to be super spicy, you need to dress it up a bit. Follow the package instructions for best results but use a whisk. It needs to be made in a saucepan on top of the stove or in a Mr. Coffee Cocomotion machine. Grind the cakes in advance for maximum convenience and use 1 and a half times the recommended amount for best results. Use whole milk for best results or 2%. Skim milk just doesn't work as well. For a spicier mug of cocoa, add ground chili powder to taste. You can also add a piece of vanilla bean while cooking if you like that. If you want even more cinnamon taste, you can cook with a cinnamon stick. You can add espresso powder as well for a nice change of pace. Instant coffee will do in a pinch plus that's a good way to get rid of intsant coffee! It's best to try a few mugs of Ibarra before you decide to spice it up. The flavor will grow on you. If you don't feel like paying the shipping fees, ask your grocer if they carry this item. Most chain grocery stores with a Hispanic section do carry Ibarra. …",21 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 Natural Calm Magnesium,5,"I have used this product before in the calcium/magnesium blend. It was suppose to be tasteless. It wasn't. It tastes awful. This lemon-raspberry tastes okay and the product is more reactive when the hot water is added. I was medically advised to take my magnesium in this form because of slipped disks in my back. This is only one piece of my back program however I can attest to the efficacy of the product. My disks are no longer slipped. It has helped me to heal. A bonus benefit for me is that taking the magnesium in this form has stopped the migraines that I have had for 36 years of my life.

 Definitely worth a try...,4,"I had been reading about Farro for a while and was very curious to try it. I purchased the 3 pound bag because it was a great price. The first thing I did was make a Farro Mac and Cheese that was featured in Rachael Ray's magazine. My husband went insane, he loved it so much. Its a very hearty grain, but is also very creamy....almost like barley....making it a great addition for soups, salads and casseroles. I froze the leftovers and they held up very, very well. My only complaint was in the packaging...there wasn't instructions on how to prepare it. Just a specific recipe using Farro as an ingredient. However, I looked it up online and was able to find a lot of basic preparation recipes. It seems like whenever I read about a new ingredient and can't find it at any of my local grocery stores, I can always find it at Superstore.

 No Maltodextrin!!!,5,"This product is the best meal replacement drink I have seen to date. I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't. The main difference between this meal replacement and other meal replacement products I've seen is in the carbohydrates they provide. Most other meal replacements I've seen either use sugars or maltodextrin as their main carbohydrate. The problem with this is that they have a high glycemic index. This means that when you eat them, your blood sugar rapidly rises and your body responds by making a lot of insulin. Then in a very short time, your blood sugar is low and you have no energy and are hungry again. This product is low sugar and no maltodextrin which is great. Hopefully it has a low glycemic index. The oil blend is this product looks to be good. They don't report the exact percentages of omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids but they do contain omega fatty acids. As for the protein, it's a blended protein that's 40 grams per serving. In my opinion, the taste of these products is great, but that's only an opinion. Concerning the nutritional value of this product, everything I've said here is easy to validate with a little research. The only downfall of this product is the cost. It's a lot cheaper to just blend protein powder, oatmeal and Udo's oil in a blender, but that obviously isn't nearly as convienent. All in all, this is a great product, but be sure to shop around because the price can vary greatly. …",18 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 My favorite lollipops of all time,5,"I was really disappointed when the WalGreens and grocery stores around me stopped carrying these. They have been my favorite lollipops since I was about twelve years old. For those buying blind, let me just clarify once and for all: THESE LOLLIPOPS ARE FLAT! THEY ARE NOT ROUNDED LIKE A TOOTSIE POP OR A DUM-DUM. The actual hard candy part of the lollipop is a delicious granny smith apple flavor unlike any other candy out there, with a very satisfying, crisp tartness. On the outside, the Tootsie Roll company has slopped a generous spoonful of sweet caramel, and yes, this does tend to make the shape of the lollipop undulate a little bit. The shape of one pop isn't going to be consistent to the next. If that bothers you, well... I'll be honest, I find that a really weird thing to hold against a lollipop. Either way, the real draw here is the taste. These things are so good that, despite them not being available in my area anymore, I am willing to online and spend shipping & handling to get them. That should say something. …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 One of the best stevia based sweeteners,5,"If you're expecting the stevia flavor to be present, you'll be disappointed. This is not a true stevia sweetener, because it only contains reb A and none of the other compounds found in stevia. Truvia is very similar to another brand called PureVia. They are pretty much equal in quality and flavor. Both are very effective at tasting close to sugar without the typical stevia flavor. Truvia differs from PureVia very slightly. PureVia has a slight creamy flavor, and Truvia is a little sweeter per packet (each packet contains more). Both are primarily sweetened with erythritol and purified reb A (another name for rubiana). Erythritol is a natural nearly zero calorie sweetener found in fruit. Reb A is a natural zero calorie sweetener isolated from stevia leaf. Unlike stevia, which is known for a leafy licorice like aftertaste, Reb A has almost no aftertaste and is intensely sweet. Because it's present in Truvia in isolated form without the other stevia compounds, Truvia tastes nothing like stevia. Truvia contains erythritol, reb A, and natural flavors. PureVia differs in that it also contains isomaltulose and a tiny bit of cellulose powder. One big difference between PureVia, and Truvia is that Truvia contains far more erythritol, so erythritol has more of an impact on the flavor than it does in PureVia. Erythritol tastes more like sugar than reb A does, but it has a watery quality to its flavor and a cooling effect. Reb A has a thin sharp sweetness to it. When the two are combined they greatly enrich each other giving a more full bodied sweetness. Truvia, NuStevia, and PureVia are the best stevia based sweeteners you can get when it comes to stevia sweeteners without the stevia flavor. PureVia tastes better in coffee because it has a creamy flavor. Of course most people love cream in their coffee, so PureVia has an upper hand there because of the creamy flavor present. The creamy flavor of PureVia goes well in some things, but not all things. Truvia is not creamy tasting, is sweeter per packet and is better suited for general purpose sweetening where a creamy flavor might not be desired. I did taste tests with my family using PureVia, Truvia, and Sun Crystals, three of the newest stevia based sweeteners. PureVia and Truvia were liked by everyone with PureVia judged slightly better for things requiring a creamy flavor and Truvia scoring better for things that taste better without a creamy flavor. Sun Crystals has the taste of stevia in it, and for that reason it scored lower, because the flavor of the stevia was a negative in some taste tests. Of the three PureVia tasted the most like sugar, Truvia the most like erythritol, and Sun Crystals the most like stevia. One thing that was interesting during the taste test that we found was that when PureVia was tasted plain after Truvia was tasted plain, PureVia tasted better, likewise when Truvia was tasted plain after PureVia was tasted plain it was judged to taste better, but when tasted together the flavor wasn't as good. If you're looking for an effective all natural zero calorie sweetener, this is about as good as it gets. The taste is very similar to sugar, but like all other sweeteners, it has it's own unique flavor. While PureVia tastes a little more like sugar and has a creamy flavor, it's not as sweet as Truvia. Truvia is a better deal because it's sweeter per packet. The difference in flavor is very minor. Also PureVia relies more on reb A for sweetening than Truvia does. Reb A is great in small amounts, but not so good in large amounts, so when more sweetness power is needed Truvia is a better choice. Very large amounts of reb A will taste bitter, but when used in normal amounts, it doesn't taste bitter. Reb A is similar to saccharin in that way. Small amounts taste better than large amounts. There's a sweetness threshold with reb A, and if that threshold is passed, it starts tasting less sweet and starts tasting bitter. That's one thing you need to know when using a reb A based sweetener. Because Truvia relies more on erythritol for it's sweetness than reb A, this is not as much of a problem as it can be with PureVia. You can use far more Truvia packets before you get a flavor ""overdose"" of reb A than with PureVia. …",66 out of 68 users found this review helpful

 We thought we were doing our best,2,"My wife and I thought we were doing our baby a favor by going organic.

With the exception of some prescription formulas, available with approval from pediatricians, only one over-the-counter formula is available without synthetic DHA/ARA, Baby,s Only, an organic product manufactured by Nature,s One in Columbus, Ohio. After today,s official announcement by the USDA, all other organic formula manufacturers will need to remove Martek,s oils from their products, Cornucopia,s Vallaeys stated. In the meantime, The Cornucopia Institute also has filed petitions with the FDA requesting that their Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) designation for the Martek oils be revoked. When Martek,s additives were originally granted GRAS status, it was with extreme reservations on the part of the FDA review panel because of adverse reactions to these oils said Valleys. When we reviewed FOIA documents, we were astonished to find that none of the infant formula manufacturers had complied with the FDA,s request to monitor adverse reactions and perform post-market surveillance of these materials. The manufacturing process for Martek,s oils likely includes genetically engineered organisms and neurotoxic synthetic solvents, which are both explicitly banned in organic production. According documents submitted by Martek to the FDA, the process to make their oils includes growing algae and fungus in a medium that is made primarily of dextrose derived from corn, yeast extract or a hydrolyzed vegetable protein, which is usually derived from soybeans. Given that the vast majority of corn and soybean products in the food supply are produced through genetic engineering, the likelihood that Martek,s DHA and ARA oils are grown in a medium of genetically engineered organisms is almost certain. The use of genetic engineering is, of course, strictly prohibited in organics. UPDATE - Ok we are 10 days in and our twins are much much happier. We did 3 days of half and half and decided to fully switch to Baby's Only. The intense screaming after eating has stopped and now both our girls are more regular. They go once every one to two days vs every 5 to 6. Much less fussy and happier overall. Was it the formula change or just a stage they went through? Maybe a little bit of both, but there is no doubt I'd never use Earth's Best again....nothing worse than seeing both your daughters screaming after eating especially when you thought you were buying something good for them....they need to remove that **** from this product. …",30 out of 37 users found this review helpful

 The quality of the product itself,5,"I have been buying this product since I discovered it at Costco, and recently discovered it on Superstore. I find this to be a versatile and extremely useful ingredient in many foods I prepare ... casseroles, soups, stews, any non-sweet that requires flavor and liquid. It has the additional health benefits of chicken soup, and may be used in hot soup drinks for flu and colds. It makes an exceptional baked brown rice side dish when paired with Himalayan Pride Basmati Rice, which is also available here. I may sound like a salesman for this stuff, but I have made my own organic broths from vegetables and bones, and it takes a lot of time and care. For a prepared product, this has good flavor and versatility. And it is not canned, another large health plus - no leached metals, additives, or plastic liner contamination. I can't testify to the shipping practices of the various postal services. I have received damaged products in the past, and it was the responsibility of the seller to package them properly, and it is the responsibility of the shipper to handle the goods properly. Usually, it seems to be the brutal treatment of the shipper in question, which means the seller must be notified. Superstore stands by their products, so I buy a lot from them. When I have had a problem, they promptly took care of it. I find I am buying more from them every month, and will do so as long as they are honest with me, as I am with them. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Terrible product,1,I bought these chicken treats after receiving several articles about dogs getting sick from other chicken breast treats that we're made in China. I bought these specifically because they were made in the USA and I assumed they would be safe. They were so hard I could barely break them and my dog wasn't chewing them well. He started choking on a piece while eating it and that was the end of that. These are terrible and dangerous. The pieces are so sharp I became concerned about him cutting an intestine or something. Now I make my own chicken treats. It's pretty easy and I know exactly what is in them. …,14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Great Product In Wrong Container,5,"Undoubtedly, the purchase and use of stool softeners would plummet if everyone, including physicians, considered magnesium. Fact: An insufficient amount of magnesium in the body is a primary cause of constipation and hemorrhoids, yet most physicians unwittingly recommend stool softeners. Fact: By taking your measure of Natural CALM daily your constipation will quickly subside. Friends, before you devour any more medications why not try a natural remedy? Natural CALM is an easy-to-assimilate powder that when mixed with water becomes effervescent. More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM. Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars. Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage. Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: ""Place powder in a glass or mug,"" it says. ""Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water."" Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide. Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy. Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch. Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors? No fructose added. For further information call customer service at (866) 416-9216. Take charge of your health. Live life to the fullest. …",17 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Cat loves the flavor,5,"Kitty loves it! Happily eats 1/2 can in one setting (13.5 lbs cat), 2-3 times a day. His fur does look fluffier after 2 months on this food and he seems more content and alert. Wet food does make him urinate more (he used to get a dry/wet mix of Urinary SO prescription diet), but I am glad, because this should help to keep his urinary tract healthy. I researched various options before settling on this one. Among other brands (wet food only), he wouldn't even touch ""Organix;"" he likes ""Evo"" fine, but not as much as Newman's own and leaves one-third of food uneatten in the bowl. As far as other flavors of Newman's own, he didn't like the Brown rice flavor (too much rice--the cat kept picking out individual grains out of his food one by one), and strangely, after eating a few cans of store-bought Chicken&Salmon flavor, he refused to eat the same flavor from Superstore. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 My favorite OIL! wonderful!,5,"If you want a very nutritious oil for your cooking and even!!! facial and body oil needs, this is the one to have! (besides Coconut oil, of course). I use them both ways and the results are simply amazing: no more wrinkles, and never hungry! It goes into everything raw, like salads and even smoothies made of veggies. I don't use it for(heat) cooking, it's too precious for that. Use olive oil instead. It's color is deep green, and when you pour some of it into your palm, you can literally see it's smooth and beautiful texture! It has a light nutty taste, and I cannot stress enough how big the health benefits are: I never feel hungry, I don't gain weight! and I have a smooth face at soon 60 years of youth! Don't believe anybody who sells you a non-fat diet! Our body NEEDS fats to be healthy, and the right fats don't make you fat, to the contrary: you have energy, stamina and healthy body cells!

 May have saved my life,5,"Being a person who has hated water all of my life, I have tried various ways to make water palatable and always failed. Doctors, friends, family and various health articles all say our bodies need x amount of water daily. Well, for me to drink water was always a dreaded experience because drinking a glass of water felt like a ton of lead in my stomach, so I just did not drink it. On rare occasions when really thirsty, I will make an effort to swallow water and force myself to not let it come back up. Because of my intense dislike of water, I can truthfully say I only drink a (small) glass of water about twice a year. Really. I don't drink sodas, beer or much of any other beverage except milk. I love milk. But, the only water in my diet is what I get from coffee (1 or 2 cups a day) and whatever other foods/drinks that might contain water. But never just plain water. Hate it. I have tried a squirt of Lemon in water...hated that too. In hot weather I will drink Lemonade on occasion, but still not enough to say I got my daily requirement. Well, someone told me to at least try Mio to see what I think about it. Tonight was the first time I tried it and now I feel that finally, I have found something to add to water to make it palatable to me, thus taking a big step to making myself healthier. In the long run, this product can be responsible for saving my life or at least making the rest of my life healthier by making water something I will now drink on a daily basis and actually enjoy it. …",12 out of 17 users found this review helpful
" A delicous, buttery tuna for people who can't stand fish (like I)",5,"--- Bonito del Norte is the very best-tasting tuna in the world! Better than fresh tuna I think. This is coming from me, someone who doesn't like fish at all. When I was little, and my father cooked fish, I started to gag and had to run out of the house, I hated that smell. I still hate that fishy taste. In a pinch, I will eat Albacore (white) tuna, but even that sometimes makes me gag (because I just am not able to stomach fish), and most of the can goes to waste, because I never want to touch it for weeks afterwards. BUT! Bonito del Norte (not necessarily this particular brand, which I do enjoy) is the champagne of tuna - it tastes so mild, and buttery, it has its own distinct flavor, in between fish and meat. Best of all is the texture, very firm and dense. When I was little, my family got to stay in my aunt's house in Spain, off season, when she couldn't rent it out to anyone else, and this was my favorite food: fresh baguette, and Bonito del Norte on top. A little bit goes a long way. You can spread a little mayo on the bread, and then put just a few pieces of this tuna on top, very sparingly (not like in American tuna sandwiches). It's the best. The taste is so exquisite, you can just open the can and eat it out of the can with a fork, without mayo. If you do use mayo, use very litte, as not to overpower the delicate taste. Wikipedia states that Spaniards call Albacore tuna (white tuna) Bonito del Norte That may be so, but the Bonito del Norte that is canned in Spain tastes totally different from the Albacore tuna normally available in the supermarket in the US, even the most expensive brands. Starkist sells a White Tuna in olive oil, which should theoretically taste the same as the Bonito del Norte in olive oil, according to Wikipedia, but that's not the case. The American Albacore white tuna has a much stronger, coarser taste. The Bonito del Norte has buttery taste, which manages to be delicate and at the same time concentrated. Therefore a litte goes a long way. Yes, Bonito del Norte is always expensive, even in Spain, but I hope that you try to taste it just once in you life, which is why I'm writing this review. PS I have had fresh (very expensive) Ahi tuna in Hawaii, grilled. It was good, but still too fishy. I've made tuna salad out the leftover cold Ahi, with mayo the next day. That tasted better, nice and firm meat, less fishy than eaten hot. But for me, nothing in the world can touch the sublime taste of this canned Bonito del Norte. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Excellent non-dairy egg replacement,5,"I've been using this egg replacer for over a decade.

I've used it both as instructed (combine with water first) and I've just sifted it with my dry ingredients and obtained excellent results. If you have a recipe for vegan cupcakes for example that tend to crumble, just add 1.5 teaspoons to the dry ingredients in your recipe and this just might fix the problem!

After start drinking this tea (about a month ago), I was surprise to find out that I didn't have the same desire to eat the candy or cookie any more! What a surprise nice finding!

I also highly recommend following FooJoy Shoumei White Tea (B0007UXIW0), FooJoy China Green Tea (B0007V1Q78) in this line. If you like black tea, you might want to try Foojoy Dim Sum Bo Nay (B0007Y7Z8E). It is very interesting: very dark in color and you will think it would be strong.

 They changed the Chips now they taste horrible,1,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy. I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan. About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket. I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it. After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to. They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed. So I e-mailed Kettle with the following: ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering."" I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag. This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks. Please let me know if I can be of any more help."" Well the next bag was good. Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost. I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company. So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle. Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand. increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand. Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same... …",20 out of 27 users found this review helpful

" Not exactly like traditional potato chips, but a great substitute",5,"One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips. I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips. In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip. This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind. I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco. I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area. Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any. I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Superstore in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me. They are definitely worth the money. I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips. The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips. I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do. Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them. As for the portion size, it's pretty generous. For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors. I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next. …",73 out of 77 users found this review helpful

 Why is this Tea so Special?,5,"I have drunk ""english-blends"" of tea in various forms and guises. But being a wee bit Scottish, I tend to like everything in life, ""maxed-out"". Almost all tea blends from various companies have FAILED to meet my criterion of ""Maximum Tea Experience"". Now, along comes Yorkshire Gold tea. Yorkshire Gold tea is carefully blended in North Yorkshire England by Taylors of Harrogate, and part of the real secret to this tea is the company's attention to DETAILS. Now undoubtedly, such teas like ASSAM (from North-East India) will give you some strength, but not always enough brightness. ""Strength"" works well at the Middle and FINISH of the flavour gamut, but initially, it is Brightness which catches your palate's attention and then the Stength simply Underscores it. It's sort of like playing a huge C chord on a concert piano in double octaves and then you gently add a LOW Contra C. The deep low note brings out the richness of the chord. The case is the same here with Yorkshire Gold. So why Yorkshire Gold and not another brand? The parent company in Harrogate is a superlative corporation who takes great pains at CONSISTENCY. The magic is in the Details. I am actually drinking a cup of Yorkshire Gold RIGHT NOW as I type this, and I can tell you, I have never found a company more consistent, attentive to details, and maddeningly insistent upon excellence. Through myriads of experiments and counter-experiments, Taylors has discovered what GRABS the tea-drinker's ""Gustatory"" attention, if you will. But there's more: this blend both refreshes and relaxes you like none other. Additionally, there is something here to which coffee drinkers may relate: AROMA. When I make the loose or bag tea variants, both exude an almost beefy richness in bouquet. The process of mixing furiously boiling fresh water with the tea invaribly and consistently produces a fine aroma akin to the scent of a British Sunday Lunch where a delectable roast beef is the order of the day. Rich, piquant, and satisfying. If your brand of tea does not do ALL that I have noted ... consider a change. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Simply the best tasting tea I have ever drank...,5,"I am addicted to this tea. Maybe because as an ex Starbucks employee I use to make, serve and drink it so much.

If you go to Starbucks on a regular basis to purchase their iced green tea and want to save some money...Starbucks uses this exact tea. A box of 20 bags cost around $4.00. The instructions state to use two bags for every 8 oz. of iced tea. At Starbucks they do not follow this. To cut costs they use one tea bag for every 8 oz. of water then they double the steeping time indicated on the box. I make well over a gallon of tea out of each box that I buy. And yes...it tastes exactly like the Starbucks ones. If you like it sweet DONT add honey or powdered sugar because it will have a totally different taste then Starbucks...instead just buy a bottle of the Starbucks classic syrup available at all Starbucks.

 Based on beef being grass fed however . . .,5,"the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately I'm unable to review the flavor as I forgot I can't have beef anymore (due to health issues). Ingredients: beef, flavoring supplement (salt, dextrose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, spices, spice extractives, soybean oil), vinegar, brown sugar, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices Here is some info found on the internet: Maltodextrin ~ maltodextrin from corn or soy can be very unsafe/poison for anyone. As all GMO products like corn and soy are genetically engineered from the monsanto company. they insert a bacteria in all GMO products, and this changes the natural organic developing of corn or soy. do not buy anything that contains maltodextrin or titanium for your own health. Maltodextrin made in the US is made from corn. Corn in the US is a GMO food so Maltodextrin as derived from a Gmo is extremely unsafe. Soy ~ this particular info from: (...) . . .fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits. Fermented soy does not wreak havoc on your body like unfermented soy products do. Here is just a sampling of the health effects that have been linked to unfermented soy consumption: *Breast cancer *Brain damage *Infant abnormalities *Thyroid disorders *Kidney stones *Immune system impairment *Severe, potentially fatal food allergies *Impaired fertility *Danger during pregnancy and nursing and for all ~ Jesus Christ (Yahushua HaMashiach) is coming back. Don't leave this world without Him... Gift of God With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news. It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world. Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God. The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God. The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction. Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc. The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever? Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God. God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven? My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight! It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him! Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death. Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ! Yahushua loves you! …",3 out of 38 users found this review helpful
 Versatile and yummy,5,"Passion fruit concentrate has become my favorite ""secret ingredient""...I use it to make a citrus sauce for halibut steaks (water, sugar, cracked black peppercorns, honey, lemon and orange juice and zest, and passion fruit concentrate)--serve the fish on a bed of arugula, pour the sauce over, garnish with julienne strips of cucumber and slivered almonds, serve alongside jasmine rice, and your guests will feel they've landed in Hawaii...I also add it to Italian Cream Cake, replacing a couple of tablespoons of liquid ingredients with concentrate, and add it to the buttercream frosting as well in place of milk. I've used this approach to make everything from a three-layer cake decorated with orchids to bite-size mini-cupcakes dusted with orange sugar. My husband puts it in martinis with pineapple, and I mix it with Hypnotiq for a gorgeous aqua cocktail.

 Total waste of money,1,"I am a total sucker for kitchen gadgets, but this just goes too far. The price is insane for what is essentially a glorified ice cube tray, which does not work as well as your basic ice cube tray. It's difficult to get the cubes out of this tray, it has an odd shape that wastes space in your freezer, and it makes 2 ounce servings, which are fine if you know you want 2 ounces, but I prefer to make 1 ounce sizes so that I can combine different flavors, or make just 1 (or 3) ounces if my baby is not as hungry and I don't want any waste. The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because of the lid - that IS handy, I must admit. But you can buy ice cube trays with lids too, that will actually fit in your freezer and stack well.

" Nice Try, but....",2,"I was thrilled to see Kellogg's coming out with a gluten free version of Rice Krispies...that is until I saw that they were going to be made with brown rice. That is the absolute first mistake. They should have just followed suit with the way General Mills altered all of their Chex cereals and replaced the malt with molasses. I decided to give these a try just for giggles. Well I can say that I am very disappointed and I now have four boxes of Rice Krispies that are going to waste. The texture is just like all of the other brown rice cereals out there -- hard and burnt-tasting. Kellogg's, you can't be using brown rice to make Rice Krispies, it just doesn't work! I have yet to try these in Rice Krispie treats, lets hope the marshmallows and butter mask the flavor. The texture is nice for a few minutes until the milk gets to them but then its like eating paste. With the evolution of gluten free foods it is so much easier to get gluten free versions of traditional favorites to taste like the original. Gluten free consumers are no longer willing to lower their standards -- PLEASE Kellogg's, take a cue from General Mills and make this cereal gluten free without changing the recipe entirely! Update: I tried making Rice Krispie treats. I was sure to add extra marshmallows to mask the toasted flavor. They were pretty decent I will say but I'm still disappointed that I now have 4 boxes of cereal to make Rice Krispie treats with, hopefully I can use the boxes before they expire. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Great maple syrup,5,"This is really good maple syrup. We've taken to using maple syrup in place of sugar in a lot of our cooking so we go through a lot of it. I've had a chance to try a lot of brands and this is one of my favorites. It's a medium amber so it's got a mild flavor that doesn't overwhelm whatever your using it in or on (if you like yours strong go with a Grade B from Highland Sugarworks). When I can't get this I usually buy the ""Shady Maple Farms"" brand which is as good but usually more expensive.

 THE rice alternative,5,"An Superstore Friend reviewed the Texmati White Rice recently. Today when I took this out of its spot, I thought: People should know how good this Royal Blend white, brown, wild, and red rice really is. Here I am on a two-fold mission: one, to explain this lovely blend and two, to suggest other uses for the empty container. How I found this rice is maybe unusual. When I am normal, I zip through the grocery store, attending business, then I'm out of there. When I am depressed, I spend two hours in the store. I look at everything. I imagine my life another way. With this rice, I thought, how exotic could I make a meal for a small dinner party? I thought of Royal Blend served in little white ceramic Chinese rice bowls I bought in San Francisco. Set the bowl right on the plate. I have colorful plates that I mix-match for fun and variety. Serve with grilled salmon fillets. Get out a vegetable cookbook for ideas there.Everything has to be fun and cheerful. This rice certainly is colorful and fun to eat. Its slightly nutty taste and hint of crunchiness would wow the taste buds and complement the salmon. Cooking this rice also saves time. Mix the water, rice, butter, and seasonings all together, then cook 15 minutes as opposed to 20 for white. Besides, Royal Blend contains no fat, just a touch of sodium, 30 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of protein, and one gram of fiber, making this hands down a superior product of rice. The second point is the availability of the containers. Once the rice is gone, I wash the container then use it to hold my various varieties of dried beans. The plastic jars look identical and neat all lining the counter top. Add attractiveness to the look. Royal Blend costs a little more, but aren't you worth it? …",21 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 Very economical ounce for ounce compared to tubed wasabi,5,"Exported from Japan, this is a very good ""fake"" wasabi powder (nearly all tubed and powdered wasabi is actually horseradish). 25g of powder is a lot, so this can will last you a long long time, making this a very economical choice for sushi lovers. I bought a tin of it 2 years ago and have still not gone through it all. To prepare, just mix with a bit of cold water and wait several minutes for the flavor to develop, then enjoy with sushi or sashimi. My directions are vague as to how much to use and how long to wait because the can's directions are not specific. Reconstituted, it's every bit as good as tubed wasabi. I find that a teaspoon of powder is more than sufficient for one person. Make only as much as you need and right before you are about to use it. The chemicals that give horseradish (and real wasabi) its pungency are very volatile and will dissipate quickly when exposed to air (15-30 mins). Don't think you'll save time by making a big batch of it and refrigerating it until next time. All you'll taste is a coarse paste of green goop. Be aware that the product description is **WRONG**. This is not an all natural product. Ingredients listed on the label: horseradish, mustard, Vitamin C, ascorbic acid, and artificial colors (Blue #1, Yellow #4). Blue #1 (Brilliant Blue FCF) is a commonly-used synthetic dye derived from petroleum. You can see it on the right side of the label in the photo if you read Japanese: chakushoku-ryou, coloring agent. Another excellent brand is Powdered Wasabi (Japanese Horseradish) , or if you prefer it in a ready-to-use tube, - Wasabi in Plastic Tube (Family Size) 3.17 Oz. , a very popular brand. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************,2,"First off, the initial arrival: It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat! Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary. Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective; 1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces 2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several. 3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging. In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags. Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's. Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way. But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Superstore charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping). If you wanted to buy using Superstore Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings. An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats …",1 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Why would anyone buy these?,2,"I bought these to try out based on good Superstore reviews which made them sound like some kind of wonder bars that were healthy and would make you happy for eternity (or something). I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain: These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like ""gluten free"" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat). In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients. Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing. …",2 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 read a newb's opinion,3,"This is the first kind of yerba mate I ever purchased. I bought it at my grocery store, in the organic section. I didn't know what to expect. It is green and the size of the particles varies greatly. Some of it is actually a powder, and it sometimes seeps out of the infuser as you're brewing it. There are pieces of stem and the leaves are not cut to a uniform size. When you brew it, you need an infuser with a very fine mesh, and you can't submerge the infuser since stuff will leak out where it closes. You want a cylindrical infuser that opens at the top, and make sure the top of the infuser is not submerged. Don't try one of those round ones that closes like 2 halves of an egg, unless you want particles in your drink. There are special gourd things you're supposed to use, but I haven't tried those. Find a good place to let the infuser drain. It will leave a dark green stain on whatever it sits on while it drains. This stain will probably wash out, but you need to watch out for it. If you spill any of the powdery particles of th dry mix, and then if they get wet, they will make the same kind of stain. Having said all of this, I liked the taste and I used up two 16 oz. packages of this in just a short while.

 Ekobrew Washer Hack,4,"When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good. I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer. If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past. The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer. The washer I used is rubber, 1/16"" thick, 5/32"" inside diameter, and 3/8"" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493. …",232 out of 235 users found this review helpful

 Unfortunately an Irresponsible Company,1,"This is the formula given to us in the hospital when our son was born. They insisted we take home the 'to go' bottles in large quantities, as did our pediatrician at every visit. Logically we continued to run with this brand. We began feeding him the powdered stuff because it is cheaper and we would often buy 10 - 20 of the larger containers at a time (we live in a somewhat rural area). We were very dismayed to learn that there was a voluntary recall on this product but were happy to hear that it was only a small batch from a certain area that was affected. It turns out this is not the case. We compared containers on the list from approximately 6 - 9 months ago that were purchased almost a 1,000 miles away (we had moved) with ones we had recently purchased locally. To our dismay both containers were on the recall list. At the premium price we pay for formula we expect that the company has good enough quality control systems in place to prevent bug arms and legs from making it into the container - hasn't anyone heard of a sifter?

 Tried most - this is best,5,"Well, we got a Keurig machine last year. Almost all of the coffee samples that came with it were too watered down tasting for my wife and me. So we started to experiment. I'd say we have tried about 85-90% of the available decaf offerings. This Jazzed Up version has been, by far, the best yet. It has even allowed me to appreciate the Keurig again. My wife - not a decaf drinker - has even switched to this. She's a bit particular and likes the store bought, caffeinated Sumatra coffee. I was going to try the extra bold Rainforest Espresso next, based on the reviews here. I was about to order the Rainforest product but the rich, bold coffee taste of Emeril's Jazzed Up convinced me to go with it again. Now my wife can drink coffee in the evening and not worry about it affecting her sleep. I'll get the Rainforest Espresso next time and add a comparison here. The Espresso will have to be very good to get us away from this one though. I do hear that the two are comparable - we'll see. You can use the larger setting on the machine and fill a mug without sacrificing taste. It's just a great cup of coffee, even for decaf. I'm off to have another. ___________________ I did purchase, and have tried the Rainforest Espresso since the above post. I'm sticking with Emeril's Jazzed Up decaf coffee for my k-cup selection. While still a good cup of coffee, the Espresso lacks the smoothness I feel we get from the Jazzed up coffee. I'm not sorry I had two boxes of the Espresso as this was a very acceptable alternative to Emeril's product, but I don't believe I'll be ordering it again. IMHO, the Rainforest Espresso is just a small notch, or two, below the Jazzed Up coffee for the smooth and robust flavor of Emeril's Jazzed Up k cup coffee. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
