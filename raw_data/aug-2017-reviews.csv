 Please avoid!!,1,"Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats. Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients. They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food. This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school. Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness. Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. Please try another brand like orijen or evo. your cat will thank you. …",8 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Sinfully rich but oh so delicious!,5,"Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna is certainly one of the most sinful of foods but, oh my gosh, is it delicious! It is a very rich but very flavorful coconut cream made from certified organic dried coconut meat from the Philippines. (I live in southwest Florida and room temperature here is just perfect for ensuring a very spreadable coconut cream). When I first opened the jar the fresh fragrance of coconut made my mouth water! Just like a kid, I could not resist sticking my finger into the jar and taking a big, generous taste. My taste buds simply exploded when the unique flavor of this decadent coconut cream melted on my tongue like sweet butter! And just like a kid, I know I will be tempted to take those sinful dips into the luscious coconut manna jar. I have noticed other reviewers' comments about the ""grittiness"" of this product and I just want to point out that coconut meat is a high fiber food and coconut manna is 100% whole coconut, so the texture is much like one should expect in a high fiber spread. Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna contains 12% fiber and 9% protein, whereas coconut oil contains none. Coconut in general is such a versatile food with an extraordinary taste and all manner of health benefits. In Sanskrit, the coconut palm is called ""kalpa vriska"" meaning ""the tree that supplies all that is needed to live."" But I must be frank...I do not think Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna or any coconut product should be used as a food therapy for any health purpose. Coconut meat is nearly all fat, 80% of which is saturated. With that said, as difficult as it will probably be, I will be using Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna only sparingly (but with utter enjoyment!) Being a raw vegan foodie and with the holidays quickly approaching, I do look forward to getting creative with Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna and devising culinary applications with it, such as in my raw, vegan spreads, soups, smoothies, sauces, cheeses, and especially in desserts. Of course I will have to consider it a celebration food because of the high saturated fat content. This luscious treat is not the best choice for health or waistline but it is so good to the palate! I will definitely be using Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna for special occasions, for entertaining and for those times of private indulgence when I need to treat myself... and I will do so with wild abandon! …",17 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 It Used To Be Better...,3,"My cat is a picky eater, and loves his chicken. So Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken has been a huge hit with Hercules for the past year or so. That is, until the last two cases. I've been noticing that it looks a little grey, and not so much like freshly cooked chicken. Then I realized that I was throwing out about 1/3 to 1/4 of each serving, something that never happened before. Then I happened to compare an older can with one of the newer ones: Bingo! While the ingredients are the same, it looks like the amount of potato starch has been vastly increased. And the cat doesn't really like it as much. …",47 out of 49 users found this review helpful
 MUCH Cheaper at Whole Foods!,1,"I was considering a purchase to try this out after reading so many positive reviews and reading that it is also dairy and soy free, HOWEVER, I called my local Whole Foods to see if they carried this and was told they did and it was $5.69 per loaf. This - - with S&H - - comes to $7.70 per loaf. NOT A GOOD DEAL AMZ! WF also told me they carry Udi's Hamburger buns in a 4-pak for $4.69 per pk, again MUCH cheaper than AMZ's offerings. NOT A GOOD DEAL AMZ! Why is it that any time there is a special need, it is used to justify outrageous prices, even on items thar are cheaper to make/produce than the regular ones - - like Tuna with just tuna, water or oil and salt @ $2.++ or more per can, as opposed to the nonsense with vegetable broth, etc. for a dollar or less per can? If we refuse to buy their products at these outrageous prices and let these venture niche products sit on the shelf, they might reconsider their outrageous prices.

 Excellent product - here's why I already ordered it again...,5,"I tried this product after being unable to find anything other than lemon juice concentrates with preservatives in my local stores. If you're reading this review, you may have a similar desire to avoid those little yellow lemon juice **** that are so common. I wanted to start incorporating more alkaline foods into my diet to balance it out. I was so happy with the Santa Cruz lemon juice that I placed a larger order a few days ago so that I wouldn't run out. Here are my thoughts on it: Pros: - Organic (no ""cides"" - pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, etc.) - One ingredient and that's it (no preservatives like sodium benzoate or sodium sulfite) - Alkaline/acidic for a nice balance to many Basic diets - NOT from concentrate - Great taste; not too weak or strong - just right - Glass bottle (no BPA) - Packaged very securely during shipping - Shipping was fast (and free as of this writing from Vitacost, despite having less than $25) Cons: - Pasteurized (this does not bother me, but some may find it as a negative) - Pouring from a glass mouth is more prone to spilling/dripping than other containers (this is extremely minor, but it's difficult to find much wrong with this product) I hope this helps your purchase decision - cheers! …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Rather weak and non-descript tea,2,"There are several other Stash teas that I've tried and enjoyed. But this one is sort of feeble-tasting. Up until now, I've gotten the Yogi Tea Egyptian Licorice Tea Organic Egyptian Licorice, Tea Bags, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) and that one actually has a bold licorice taste. And it is that one that is serving as the point of comparison to this Stash tea. Keep in mind that I don't add honey or any sweetner to my teas, so they have to stand on their own. This Stash Licorice Spice has a weak licorice taste and a weak spice taste. I have to use TWO teabags at a time (which makes the seemingly low price not so much a good deal). …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

I like them medium rare so I only turn them 3 times. Best burger you'll ever have.

 Does not live up to the hype,2,"I was very disappointed with this product. I ordered it because it was highly recommended on the Food Network and also on the Travel Channel. I did not think the cake had much rum taste (sort of like it had been sprinkled very lightly with the Carbbean rum) and it was much more dense than I thought it would be. I tried ""doctoring"" it up a bit with more liquor, whipped cream, etc without success. Although one could eat it, it was not the best and I wound up throwing half of it out. I would suggest saving your money and making your own Bacardi Rum cake. You will be much happier with the product. …",8 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 a great tasting snack (small meal) substitute,5,"If you're a former junk food junkie like me, then you'll get an idea of what these things taste like when I describe them as a more fibrous (chewy) version of rice kripy squares with a chocolate coating on the bottom. They really are that delicious. And at 170 calories with 4gm of fat (1.5gm saturated), 9gm of protein, and 5gm of fiber, they are a healthy alternative to many other types of snacks that one could indulge in (pastries, candy, etc). These are easily my favorite protein bar and I've tried over a dozen kinds. Edit on 9/27/07: This review pertains to the chocolate peanut Go Lean flavor. I just noticed that Superstore is grouping reviews for all of Kashi's bars together, so without specificity in the review it's impossible to know which product is being reviewed. …",29 out of 30 users found this review helpful
 Snowmobile Fresh,4,"I'd first like to thank Gov. Palin for introducing me to this tasty treat. The FWR (fresh whole rabbit) was the perfect late night snack at the end of a perfect evening spent with the 'Dinosaurs Aint Real' discussion group in Juno. I'd also like to thank her for defining snowmobile fresh - ""in order to receive this label, the critter has to be path-whacked by a Skiddoo, immediately placed in a bucket of snow, and delivered to Joe Butcher in no less than thirty minutes ... for 'de-skinning'"" I don't, on the other hand, think she was right when she told me fresh was nasty-kinky. FYI - I have not been able to find nasty-kinky whole rabbit on Superstore but I did find it on a few other sites. And here's where I must confess that things got a bit out of hand. After the tasty FWR at Dinosaurs Aint Real, I started attendig similar meetings in search of FWRs. I was mostly disappointed, but I did get a serving at Better Sex Through Prayer. Unsatisfied, I placed my first order at Superstore for a half dozen. I promptly ate these in five days and was kicked into an FWR binge that lasted two and a half months. Seventy-three FWRs later and a positvive drug test that required an ice trucker's union hearing, I realized things were out of control and went cold turkey. I can only thank the good people at Pickled Rat Torsos for their help in swapping out of my FRW addiction. This is a great product. Just be aware of the addictive nature of partaking. Thus my reason for four and not five stars. …",7 out of 12 users found this review helpful

Spicy, really spicy, chocolate, etc. Now if I eat those things I have heartburn constantly. I happen to LOVE spicy foods! I read where apple cider vinegar can really help with acid reflux, heartburn and GERD. I don't like to take any medications so I decided what the heck. Well, I can honestly say it does work! I take 1 TBS in a glass of water after every meal and voila! no more heartburn. It also seems to be helping with severe sinus issues I have. I swear I feel less congested.

 The very best Hoisin Sauce available !,5,"Being an afficionado of Oriental cuisines, I can say I've tried many different sauces claiming to be ""Hoisin Sauce"" and that the Koon Chun brand is without a doubt the best I have ever eaten. Whether used for moo shu dishes, a marinade for ribs, chicken or spread onto a Peking Duck pancake, its thick, rich flavor is surpassing. Used sparingly, a little goes a very long way, and puts many of the thinner, sometimes watery, imitators to shame. Even given the seemingly high shipping price I recommend trying this out and think you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was the first time I spied it on the shelf of a local oriental supermarket and decided to try it out. Since I no longer live within comfortable distance of an oriental market, I now order this through Superstore every few months and always try to keep a supply on hand. Hope you enjoy it as much as I always have. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

The anise/licorice flavor is intense. The tea is relatively sweet, so in my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary, but you may want to add a little honey to it.

 Tasty but with a big drawback,2,"Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot. Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!! Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Superstore product description. Ouch! So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter. Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten. That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past. However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is ""imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources. We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west."" All that said, taste is pretty good and the ""wet"" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer). …",10 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Makes the best ever pumpkin pie crust,5,"This Thanksgiving I used these cookies instead of our regular brand when making my grandmother's famous cookie crust for pumpkin chiffon pie, and it was so delicious that everyone at the table was left speechless. For one crust, use one and a half cups of cookie crumbs, a combination of ginger cookies and vanilla wafers. Add in some finely chopped pecans, a quarter cup of confectioner;s sugar, and a third cup of soft butter. Spread in a buttered pie pan and bake for 10 minutes at 350°.

" Great stuff at first, but not for long (see my edit within review)",2,"I liked the flavor of this syrup at first, as did my wife. It has a unique, natural taste, albeit not as sweet as the ""store-bought"" name-brand syrups that you find in the grocery stores. But then again, apparently the sugar content is less, thus it is undoubtedly better for you. But, I guess that's pointless if you end up not wanting to use it. My kids would not touch the stuff. Also, it is expensive for what you get. I bought it at a special discount from the regular Superstore price, and it was still expensive even with the discount. A bit too expensive, IMHO. The photo can be a bit deceiving too; it comes in a very small jug...check the ounce figure carefully before making your buying decision. Edit - Sept 2010: I thought I would update this review and let you know that after a few months, we ended up throwing this syrup away (about a third was left) because it had stayed on the shelf for so long, mold started to grow. My kids continued to refuse to eat it. Even I started going back to the store-bought brands. I read an interesting article in Esquire magazine that made me remember this product and my review...and made me smile: ""People give 100 percent real maple syrup as gifts. People take their kids to farms to see it collected and cooked. In the Northeast, it's extolled. Which is strange, because it's not as good as Aunt Jemima or Mrs. Butterworth's, its mass market imitators. First of all, syrup shouldn't run, it should ooze. Real maple syrup runs. The mass market stuff - the stuff you grew up on - that stuff oozes. It has viscosity. So instead of going straight into the pancakes, like water into a sponge, it maintains their integrity. And the taste: Mass-market syrup is sweet. Real maple syrup is a beguiling combination of sugar and resin. Which is authentic, sure. But bark is authentic. Is there anything else we eat that tastes vaguely of tree?"" I couldn't have said it better. I'll give it two stars instead of one because we did muddle through the stuff for a week or two and at least at first, perhaps because of the novelty, we though we liked it. However, our enthusiasm quickly dwindled. Think twice before you buy. Second edit: Sept 2010 - I found this information regarding real maple syrup, which may be why this Grade B version made me (and my kids) avoid it...apparently this grade is best for cooking: Here's how real maple syrups differ from each other... Grade A Light Amber or Vermont Fancy usually is made early in the season and has a mild, delicate flavor. It's often used for maple candies. Grade A Medium Amber is darker and has a more robust maple flavor. It's typically used for pancakes and waffles. Grade A Dark Amber, darker still, has strong maple and caramel-like flavors. It can be used for pancakes if you like a more intense flavor, as well as for cooking. Grade B is very dark and has the strongest flavor, mostly maple but also with hints of caramel. It's the best choice for cooking. …",9 out of 31 users found this review helpful

 My bassett hound LOVES his food now...,5,"Canidae has definetly proven to be a tasty, balanced source of food for my dog. Initially i had started my new pup on IAMS because of its popularity - but after reading the ingredient list and hearing the the IAMS corporation had just been sold (therefore not keeping the quality of their product) I decided I needed to provide my hound with a heathier source of nutrition. I volunteer at the local Human Society Shelter and a friend of mine there suggested that I try ""Canidae"". At first I was hesitant because of the cost - but when i read the nutrition facts and saw REAL, all natural ingredients, i felt confident enough that the price was worth it. Before i started feeding my bassett Canidae he would only eat once a day (placing a full bowl of food down for him in the early morning on my way to work...he would wait until late at night to eat AFTER I had my dinner and slowly munch on a couple bits here and there). The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food. Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime. Occasionally I will cook up some frozen vegetables with an egg and mix it in his food for a little variety, but I havent had to do that in a while.

Plus, the meat is marked ""by-products"", which is throwaway parts unusable for anything else and of the lowest quality in nutrients. Wheat, corn, and soy are also part of the ingredient list and among the worst offenders when it comes to allergies in dogs. They are among the most difficult things for dogs to digest.

" Yummy, ready to eat and share",5,"The first package of Kasilof smoked salmon I bought was several years ago and it was not good at all, the fish fell apart in chunks when the sealed foil bag was opened. I contacted the company and during our discussion, realized the foil package had been unsealed in it's cellophane wrapped cardboard box. They could have sent me back to the store, but instead replaced the product and shipped it in two days. This package contained delicious smoked salmon in a nice solid filet which was savored with great gusto. Because we had spent a week on the Kenai peninsula a few years back fishing for salmon in a fishing hole in Homer, this fish reminded us of those days. Since this first filet, we have enjoyed the salmon on many occasions, also sharing it as gifts. I personally do not care if it arrives in a box or the sturdy cardboard which I purchased this week. The fish inside is the same -- flavorful, moist, not bad nutritionally, and perfect for more than one meal if you can find the 24 ounce filet which is our favorite. Wild salmon, salt and brown sugar are the only ingredients in this product and I'm all in favor of wild fish with no colorings or preservatives added. It's great plain and simple, in hot pasta, as a fish spread or a cold salad. Must buy more when it's on sale! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 A boost of health in a bottle,5,"Very healthy stuff. I don't eat as much vegetables as I should, but this helps balance my diet with the chock-full of nutrients it provides. The most appealing benefits to me are 100% DV vitamin A as beta carotene, powerful antioxidant blend, and probiotic active cultures like those in in yogurt. The aroma is pleasant and so is the taste, but the solubility is difficult. Since it contains insoluble fiber, it doesn't dissolve completely with water or juice. Smoothies are best for this mix. I tried cold water and hot water, and its quite gritty in both --not sand-like mind you, but sort of like not completely mixing cocoa powder and trying to drink it. Speaking of which, for some odd reason the taste and aroma reminds me of hot cocoa. After discovering hot water doesnt help dissolve everything, I wouldn't recommend it since heat can diminish a lot of the nutrient power this mix provides, especially the antioxidants. Per the label, it is best kept frozen or refrigerated after opening. UPDATE 12/10/2011 *********** I find that I like the taste when it is mixed with vanilla-flavored soymilk. One way I use the mix is to add flavor to my high-fiber cereal and soymilk, which looks gross since your milk turns green, but at least the gritty bits are masked by the cereal and dont bother me one bit (pun?). UPDATE 1/20/2012 ************ I'm really enjoying this supplement powder! I can sense myself feeling better throughout the day. Since I take this supplement first thing every morning, I have become more regular in my bowel movements (almost clockwork) and noticed good changes in my stool, defecating clean and easy. At first, I was very gaseous as my body tried to get accustom to the high volume of fiber in my supplemented diet. But after a couple days the flatulence subsided, and I was reaping the benefits of fiber without the sound effects (which by the way did not smell... at least to me =P ). UPDATE 2/2/2012 ************ I noticed that there is another size available for this Green Superfood (17oz vs 8.5oz) for a cheaper price per ounce value. Just to let you guys know, I bought this one back in November 2011 and the expiration date for my container says August 2013. Thats nearly a 2-year shelf life! But I think they are referring to the shelf that is in your refigerator, rather than your cupboard. UPDATE 2/24/2012 ************ I've been taking this every weekday at work, one scoop every morning with my cereal. Finally finished the container roughly in two months. As I try to reflect on any long term changes, I do notice that I wake up easier for work, which is at 4:00 AM every morning. I try to get at least 7 hours of sleep, but most of the time I fall asleep between 10:00-11:00 PM, and surprisingly I'm still mentally awake until that time. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

They are probably good for you if you want a stowaway fruit you can use when you haven't gotten to the store for awhile or want it out of season to sprinkle into something, but otherwise the price and messiness are both much too prohibitive.

Sure, I understand why they want to expand their market and I appreciate that, but these new aerated kisses? Don't WASTE your money. When I saw them in the store I read the description and thought they sounded intriguing, but the first one I put in my mouth tasted like extremely sub-par chocolate (yeah, I know Godiva and other brands but I still like Hershey's-this wasn't even Hershey's typical quality) and for sure-was aerated-and I thought ""oh great, now Hershey's has joined the current bandwagon of figuring out how to give the consumer less quantity, less quality, and simultaneously make them think they're getting something special"".

 Folgers is the SAME STUFF,4,"It's a blizzardy night in Boston (we're getting 18 inches this evening) and on a whim, my wife and I bought every type of Folgers & Senseo coffee -- determined to figure out which one is the best, and then we'll just buy that one. Just once and for all. Anyway, the results are subjective, and I'm not even done yet. But one thing became clear to me and my wife: the Folger's Home Cafe (something like that) is COMPLETELY IDENTICAL to the Senseo Medium Roast Coffee Pods. I kid you not! It looked the same, it smelled the same, it tasted the same. And the Folger's is a dollar cheaper (at least, at Bed Bath and Beyond). Don't get me wrong, I'm not above paying more if the coffee's better. I don't really care that much. But it's almost *comical* to pay more once you realize that they appear to be the exact same product (probably some sort of mild roast Columbian, ground to a specific textures).

 Absolute favorite beverage.,5,"Arizona Diet Green Tea is my absolute favorite soft drink, and the fact is that I ONLY drink this or water. I will say that nothing is as good as this flavor bought in the GLASS bottles (there's something about the plastic bottles that changes the flavor). However, for cost and convenience, these packets come very close. Other than the great flavor, two things that make this stand out from other sugar free iced tea mixes is that it completely dissolves easily. There is NEVER any residue at the bottom of the bottle, and unlike some other mixes (Crystal Light for example), this doesn't cause acid reflux. That last part may not apply to everyone, but may be important to some (like me). Highly recommended, especially at the subscribe & save price. A friend of mine bragged that she buys these for only $2 a box at Walgreen's, but I noticed that hers only have 8 per box ($0.25 per packet), while these have 10 per box ($0.2485 per packet at the current S&S price), so these are the same. Since Poland Spring bottles go on sale all the time for $3.99 for a case of 24, the total cost for a bottle of Arizona Diet Green Tea is about $0.41. When stores are selling cold 20 oz bottles of soda for $1.50, $0.41 seems pretty inexpensive to me. It's even less if you get your Poland Spring at Costco or some other price club. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Absolutely amazing -- thank God for this product!,5,"A little over a week ago and completely out of the blue, I started having heart palpitations. I'm a 27-year-old female and am on no medications and have no significant medical history. The first two days, I only noticed a few of them. Then for the next 3 days, I had them much more frequently. I could put my fingers on my pulse and literally feel my heart skipping beats (a long pause followed by 2 closer-together beats). It was absolutely terrifying; I couldn't sleep for two nights because I was afraid I wouldn't wake up. I had read that these are typically harmless, especially if they aren't accompanied by any underlying heart issues or symptoms. But that doesn't make them any less frightening and unsettling. Finally, on day 5, I went to the doctor who confirmed with an EKG that I was having premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). He told me just to forget about them, that they were harmless. That lessened my anxiety related to the heart palpitations a bit, but I knew something had to have caused them, and I wasn't content to just deal with them forever. I had my blood checked, and I was neither hyperthyroid nor hypothyroid, and my potassium level was normal (these are potential causes of the PVCs according to my doctor, in addition to caffeine and stress). But I also read that a magnesium deficiency can cause heart palpitations (and being deficient wouldn't have been a surprise because my diet had been less-than-ideal). So, on day 6, I went to a health food store and was encouraged to try this product. I paid $18 for 4 ounces! I went home and took a big initial dose (probably 2 teaspoons) and, within a few hours, I noticed that my heart beat wasn't skipping as frequently. The next day, I noticed an occasional flutter but nothing like the big scary pounding flip-flops from the days before. The next day, they were gone altogether, and they have not returned. I have been palpitation-free for several days now, and I undoubtedly owe my relief to this magnificent magnesium! Beyond the cessation of the abnormal heart beat, this product helps me sleep like a log! It has also made me feel much calmer, even in situations where I ordinarily would feel anxious. I am truly thankful to have found this product! …",21 out of 26 users found this review helpful
" Overpriced, incorrect portions",2,"I found this product at my local Whole Foods for significantly less, which is shocking considering Whole Foods isn't exactly known for low prices - and I purchased in bulk on Superstore so the per unit price definitely should have been better. Also, infant cereal is supposed to be 1/4 cup of dry cereal to 2 oz. of liquid, which is what it says on this container, but the cereal is way too thick when you make it like that. The instructions say that 1/4 cup is 14 grams of cereal, which is not true; I weighed it myself and came up with about double that in grams. So I have no idea whether the nutrition facts apply to the 14g or the 1/4 cup.

 another amazing noodley experience,5,"Those of you who know me know that I don't eat pasta or carbs and am forever on a quest to find noodle substitutes that don't feel like a compromise. A couple of years ago I bought and reviewed a turning slicer, the Cuisine A4982799 Tri-Blade Plastic Spiral Vegetable Slicer which I still love and use frequently to turn assorted vegetables into great noodle alternatives. Recently someone mentioned these kelp noodles and I decided to give them a try. Oh my, these are phenomenal in every way. Don't like to cook? Don't worry, these noodles don't require cooking. You CAN cook them, but you don't have to. It has only been a couple of weeks since I've found them so I haven't tried a large assortment of recipes but everything I have tried so far has been fabulous. Cold noodles with sesame sauce was a hit with everyone. These noodles are slightly chewy like pasta but they are also kind of crunchy like bean sprouts. They are thin like regular spaghetti and crystal clear like cellophane noodles. In and of themselves they have a delicate and refreshing taste with no weird smell like some of those other noodle alternatives. They are a wonderful size and texture and they hold thick sauces really well. Everyone who has tasted the cold noodles with sesame sauce has moaned with delight and licked their plate clean. I've also tried these noodles with a ramp pesto (slightly spicier than a basil pesto) and they held up so well with that sauce, too. The Ramp pesto was another crowd pleaser. If you are on a lo carb diet or lo calorie diet or a raw diet, vegan diet, vegetarian diet, or lo cholesterol diet, these noodles are a must have item. According to the package nutritional info, there are only around 20 calories in a pound of the noodles. There is no sugar, no cholesterol and only 1 carb per serving (3 servings in the bag). And they are made from sea kelp so they have lots of good nutrition. To be sure, I was VERY skeptical when I first tried them. I can be VERY squemish about new foods, particularly some of these weird, healthy alternative foods. I also have a very sensitive stomach that revolts easily when it is displeased with my menu choices. I was so afraid that they would smell like old shoes or taste like that horrible stuff you have to drink before a colonoscopy, but to my surprise and delight, there is no smell and no weird taste to get used to and my stomach has remained quiet and satisfied. In fact, I am beginning to wonder if they are too good to be true. The cynic in me is waiting for the other shoe to drop, so to speak. Its not simply that these noodles don't smell or taste bad, its that they actually are so so so GOOD and they are fun to eat. They have a clean and refreshing quality to them. I am enjoying coming up with recipes to showcase them but honestly I am not sure if I can top the sesame sauce. I have yet to try them with traditional Italian pasta sauces, but I have a feeling they would be great with a hearty marinara. They are a natural for all sorts of Asian cuisine. I bet they'd make an amazing base for Pad Thai. If you do try them and find recipes you like, please post back here and let me know. So, to recap (for those of you who don't like to read a lot of text): no cooking required (but you CAN cook them) taste great unbelievably lo calorie lo cholesterol lo carb no sugar versatile healthy holds up well to sauces no weird taste, texture or smell much much much better than shirataki noodles (in my opinion) The Bottom Line: If you use these in place of pasta I am pretty sure you wont feel like you are settling for second best. These are a class act. Their only flaw seems to be the somewhat steep pricing, but isn't this true of all relatively new foods? …",67 out of 67 users found this review helpful

 surprisingly good,5,"I enjoy eating ramen, and noodles in general, and since the powers-that-be took away our lunch break, during the workday I end up surviving on microwave-only, or just-add-water items while sitting at my desk. I try to cycle through various brands and flavors and types. I've had other Myojo noodles before (the boil-in-a-pot-at-home variety) and they've always tasted great. The way this yakisoba is prepared is by first pulling open a designated corner to access the interior. You have to remove four small packets (seasoning/ingredients), lying on top of the dry noodles inside. You tear open and pour in the dried veggie packet. You pour in the boiling water...I used the hot water from a water cooler...and cover the top. It says to wait 3 minutes...I wait about 5 minutes since the water I'm using isn't as hot, but I guess it also depends on what you prefer for the consistency of your noodles. You then remove a sticker tab from the top, drain the noodles through the slits the sticker tab had covered, remove the top, and add and mix around the contents of the remaining three packets into the noodles and it's ready to eat. I hope I didn't make it sound like a complicated science experiment, but when you do it, it's actually pretty simple. Their fill-and-drain packaging works well, I've had other noodle bowls where the drain holes/slits were too big and the noodles fall out into the sink, or the water doesn't drain out properly. Flavor-wise, it's surprisingly good (from looking at the ingredients, it looks like it uses tuna product for flavor, not beef)...when I go out to eat, I order beef yakisoba, because the beef base provides the best flavor (or so I believe). My friend orders chicken yakisoba because she remembers some really tasty beef yakisoba her grandma used to make her, but she no longer eats beef. And the chicken yakisoba she orders always tastes bad (and she agrees). If you're a meat-lover, this yakisoba could be even better if it had some sort of meat-like bits to add extra texture. …",16 out of 19 users found this review helpful

" Refreshing, unusual, and natural",4,"Until recently, I had never heard of the brand `Izze', much less their line of Sparkling Juice beverages. When Superstore Vine posted a request to review them, however, my interest was most certainly piqued, being a sucker for anything fruit-flavored. My only dilemma revolved around what flavor to order. They all look so interesting to me, but I deliberated between the three flavors I found most intriguing: Blackberry, Pomegranate, and Clementine. I finally decided on the Clementine. When a case of twenty-four arrived at my office, I had plenty to share with a couple of friends, and after chilling a few cans, we enjoyed our first taste of this unusual libation together. We all enjoyed it, although I think I liked it more than the other two. However, I've been to wine tastings with this pair of friends, and I notice they don't usually care for sparkling wine either, which leaves me to wonder if it was the effervescence that they didn't like rather than the flavor. As for me, I adore sparkling beverages, so this is right up my alley. The Clementine flavor tastes just like the fruit, although I admit I had expected a slightly sweeter drink than the Izze turned out to be. The label on the can states it is ""naturally flavored"", and that is exactly what I got. My belief that it would be sweeter is probably borne of the fact that most commercial beverages do have more sugar added. Because of this, the slightly tart taste was a bit startling, but after the first few sips I truly appreciated the freshness of it. In fact, I enjoyed the Clementine flavor so much that I went looking for the Izze beverages in the local stores, and succeeded in finding both of the other flavors I wanted to try: Pomegranate and Blackberry. Of all of them, I think the Blackberry is probably my favorite, although the Clementine is a close second. I think the Blackberry wins by a nose strictly because it is such an uncommon flavor for a beverage, and that appeals to me as much as the flavor itself does. It helps that I adore blackberries, though. The Pomegranate was my least favorite of the three, and I don't believe I'll buy it again, although I did drink all four cans in the pack that I purchased. The flavor was slightly bitter, although it does grow on you after a few swallows. But once again, it does taste very close to eating the pomegranate fruit. I definitely recommend the Izze drinks. I will most certainly be purchasing both the Clementine and Blackberry flavors in the future. …",18 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 So small...couldn't hurt to eat just a few...so very small...,4,"So here's how it went down. My teenage sons crowd around with innocent curiosity as I take the mammoth 5-pound bag out of the cardboard box, the box with the beguiling Superstore smile on the side. That knowing, wicked Cheshire grin. Within seconds the bag is neatly cut open. An oddly hypnotic aroma wafts out. It begins. We all sample one or two of the pleasantly rubbery candies, but find ourselves exchanging the same puzzled expression: that flavor---not really cola...vaguely medicinal, yet not offensive. Hmm. Further testing is required. We all sit down. Sampling continues now in earnest---they're so small! Where's the harm?---and we agree that you need to eat quite a few to identify the flavor with any accuracy. Not a name brand cola, to be sure...one of those ""store brands,"" after it's gone flat. We notice that after the first 50 or so, the flavor seems to change somewhat, perhaps because all our teeth are now caked with adherent masses of gummy residue. Our mood is high, so testing continues. General consensus is reached after the first pound or two that the bottles in the middle of the mass are softer and more fragrant than the stuff from the top of the bag. The bag is passed around, sniffing ensues. Great effort is expended seeing how far a bottle can be stretched, while held between the front teeth, until it breaks. The unmistakable signs of hyperglycemia ---exhilaration, rapid speech, a cola-like aroma on the breath---go somewhat unnoticed as we burrow deeper into the jiggly wad of gummies. Dinner is postponed along with homework. A telephone call from my ex-wife goes unanswered. The scientific process cannot be interrupted. Would Fermi have taken time out from inventing the x-ray deathgun to take a call from his ex-wife? Please. The fun almost stops when a bottle goes up a nostril ---kids!--- but everything is soon back on track when we discover that moistened bottles can be stuck to the forehead for minutes at a time. Soon my sons' faces bristle with the things. A joke is made about ""edible lesions"". Hilarity ensues. Photos are taken. Outside it grows dark while leaves blow about, unraked. The scratching of a pet at the door stopped some time ago. Bottles are eaten ten at a time now. Cola-stained spittle dribbles down a chin. No time to wipe. Got to keep chewing. They are SO VERY SMALL. Suddenly the bag is empty. Empty. The room goes quiet. The box is re-examined, but no stray gummies are found. The box with the grin. That ****, mocking grin. I have to explain to the children why I only ordered one 5-pound bag. We all feel somewhat sick. We are all trembling now. Parents, sometimes single dads cannot be trusted to make good judgments about their kids' eating habits. Living with the stress of alimony can pervert that part of the mind which regulates dietary choices, or common sense.

Please note that Fulvic acid is a product of dead rotting organic matter.

" Use Very Lightly! Or better yet, Save Your Money.",1,"Ok. So I bring it home (from Wal-Mart) and look for the directions on the jar.. What Directions!?

Can you imagine my surprise when I tasted the fish, only to have a veritable bouquet of flavour explode in my mouth. I must say that I'm never going to use commercial salt on my food anymore.

 Bad,1,"I was attracted to this box of cookies because of the ""brand"". ""Late July"" sounds like a wonderful brand name, and late July does bring back wonderful memories for me: it sounds like a fish fry with homemade french-fried potatoes and cole slaw and hush puppies, an ice bucket, iced tea, a cool breeze blowing from the fan, a porch, and lots of love. That's what I thought of when I saw this brand. Also, it is natural and therefore, vegans can have this product. Vanilla bean with green tea: The cookies didn't taste good. The flavor idea was pretty good. There was a hint of good flavor. Vanilla bean with green tea sounds wonderful. Possibly, the bad taste was due to all the soy and soy products used. I managed to eat this whole box (of vanilla bean with green tea) without throwing any out. Dark chocolate: Horrible. I couldn't even finish the whole box; I had to throw out most of it. (And I'm the queen of conservativeness.) The ""dark"" chocolate was so dark and so horrible, that it was too much for even a chocolate lover. The chocolate had a horrible taste. Not to mention the horrible taste it left in your mouth. (Possibly too much soy, and whatever was in that chocolate.) I literally had to go and buy some lemons and ate two, and also some potato chips, just to get that taste out of my mouth. Never again. …",4 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Not recommended after they changed their formula,5,"I started feeding my dogs Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food almost 5 years ago. Prior to that I used NutroMax. Wow, what an amazing food. My german shepherd and 2 golden retrievers have the most incredible coats. Their poops are firm (and easy to pick up) and nearly odorless. No allergies either, unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems. I've convinced one person to change to Canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it. I buy it locally as I go thru 40 pounds every 3 weeks (feeding 3 large dogs). I highly recommend this food, could not be happier. Update: Canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late 2008 and at the same time, in order to save money, changed their formulas. Added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and GI problems. The organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about Canidae than any manufacturer in recent history, due to their formula change. A fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about 50% of the Canidae bags back from owners w/ pets having problems w/ the new formula. All 3 of my dogs had bad reactions, and I even did a gradual change over because I was told ahead of time (by my friend) that they changed the formula. Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, scratching. My one golden scratched himself raw to the point I had to take him to the vet. After using Canidae for many years, and recommending it to many others, I decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it. I switched to using California Natural Lamb and Rice and Orijen Adult, two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available. Both company control the ingredients, manufacture the food, have numerous quality checkpoints, and do their own distribution. My dogs are different ages and have different needs so I do a blend of the CalNat and Orijen and WOW, what a difference. Their coats are shiny, their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free. And they love it! Both are great foods, a bit more expensive than other foods but to me, worth every penny. Cal Nat and Orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion. If you are considering Canidae, I'd recommend you look at Cal Nat or Orijen instead. New Rating: Canidae - 0 stars California Natural - 5 stars Orijen - 5 stars (I'd give Orijen 10 stars if I could, it really is that good). …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Best Sea Salt,5,"I first heard about this sea salt in the book, ""Real Food"", by Nina Planck, who touted its health benefits and delicious taste. Unlike most salts available today -- including gourmet sea salts, kosher salts, and table salts -- Celtic Sea Salt is hand-harvested, unprocessed, and unrefined in Brittany using centuries-old techniques. This means it retains its original natural minerals, the absence of which in today's diet can contribute to a range of health problems. So fine, it's good for you. But how does it taste? As a regular user of expensive sea salts (purchased in gourmet food stoes, Whole Foods, etc.) before finding this one, I can say it is by far the best tasting one on the market. It actually has a delicious stand-alone flavor and tastes less metallic than other sea salts I've purchased and more like authentic salt should. I purchased some at Whole Foods and kept it out in a salt cellar on our table. It quickly became the only salt we use, both to season our food at the table as well as in a wide range of recipes. Now I buy it in bulk via Superstore, which offers a better price per ounce than the small jars sold at Whole Foods. …",83 out of 85 users found this review helpful
 One of my favorite fats,4,"Given that we are living in a time when (at least in the US) we are told that fats in our diets are bad for us, it is a real pleasure to find an item like this. I have long been a fan of animal fats when used in moderation (O-K, not always in moderation, I did makes some duck-fat french fries not too long ago, INCREDIBLE!). Yes, many people eat way too much fat, but more importantly they often eat the wrong ones. Certain hydrogenated fats not only have dubious effects on our health they just don't add as much flavor as traditional fats such as butter, olive oil, chicken fat and, yes duck fat. I try to watch both my calorie and fat intake but I do so by eating less and choosing my fats for flavor. Duck fat gives ordinary dishes like spinach or mashed potatoes more taste and complexity that would butter or, God forbid, margarine. The French have known this for centuries and use duck fat to add flavor and depth to a wide variety of foods. I sometimes buy my duck fat in larger tubs, 10-16 oz., but I like these little 1.5 oz. containers. They stay fresh on the shelf when unopened and then I use the entire thing, not needing to worry about finding room for it in my overly-stocked refrigerator. The cost per ounce is not to bad when buying it in these little cups, about the same as some of the larger tubs. The only thing that I don't like is the the oils and fat solids tend to separate. Not a big deal if I am mixing it into a dish or browning something with it, but if I want to use it as a spread (highly recommended) I have to stick it in the fridge first and then stir it up. Other than that I must say that this is a staple for me and a great addition to any pantry (when used reasonably, of course). …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 For Dried cup-o-soup: FIVE STARS,5,"We all know no packaged soup--canned or cuppa--is gonna be as delicious as the fresh, home-made stuff. Still, convenience is worth a bit of sacrifice, for those rushed or lazy days. I ordered this because 1. I like split pea, it's like a filling, comfort soup and 2 I wanted to try a vegan soup (no ham or the other stuff that they usually put in pea soup). I didn't expect much. I expected ADEQUATE, no more. Well, surprise me. This was TASTY. I am very pleased with this dried/cup soup. If you follow instructions precisely, it should come out with a terrific texture (not too runny, not too thick) and a nice pea flavor. My only quibble is that it's on the salty side (though not eye-crossingly so). I would definitely get more of this. I'm gonna go through this case pretty fast, I can tell you.

 NOT the actual pink himalayan salt!!,1,"Great price but once I tasted it I realised why it's such a great price. Because it is not the real super fantastic pink salt that I have come to love. This salt has a very prounced aftertaste, the kind you find with cheap table salt. I took this bag over to my sister who had the real pink salt. Side by side we could see and defintely taste that this wasn't the real stuff. We concluded that it must be a very small amount of pink salt added in for color and mixed with regular table and sea salt. Again, the aftertaste is very strong, something you NEVER taste with the genuine Himalayan pink salt- one of the many reasons people pay so much for it. And this defintely ISN'T it.

 Great dog food for dogs with digestive problems,5,"I originally bought this as a replacement for Science Diet's I/D as it was always much more expensive than anything else out there. I/D was also more expensive than Newman's at my local vet's office. I have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past. We tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. We found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her Milkbone treats. We needed something organic without a lot of beef in it. While this one does have some bi-product for protein, it doesn't seem to bother my dog at all. She also has normal stools every time which wasn't the case even with the I/D. My dog hated the I/D. She would often leave a good portion of it on the ground or in the bowl and rarely ate it in its entirety. With the Newman's own it is night and day. She scarfs it down in less than a couple minutes and usually eats a bowl in one sitting. It seems like she loves it from the way she eats it. A couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem I had with other dog foods. I gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now. My husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems with. On a side note, I wish Newman's offered a bigger size bag. I have to order these all the time due to the 12.5 pound bag. My husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size. It still works out being cheaper than the $50 bag of 17 pound I/D I was ordering so I'm still happy with it.

 Awesome Taste,5,"My husband and I have raised honey bees for years, though we cannot call our honey organic because we live in an area where other farmers use chemicals which our bees may bring home to the hive unintentionally. This honey is the most delicious honey I have ever tasted!! We did have one time when we raised bees in Southern Illinois in a large clover field that was close to this good, maybe even as good though flavor somewhat different. YS Royal Honey is so good it was hard to not eat too much. We should all practice temperance in eating, even if it is something that is ""good for you."" Although the price is high, consider it like gourmet candy. Because it is not heated to high temperatures in processing, it crystallizes much quicker than more refined honey products. But, it can easily be liquefied by placing the jar in a pan of hot water (not on the stove). If you put it in the microwave to soften it, you will kill some of the beneficial elements in the honey. Microwave ovens are great for heating water, but must be used at low power levels for short periods of time if you want to maintain the beneficial micro-nutrients in your food! Also, research has shown that if you use plastic containers in the microwave, chemicals are released from the plastic which are then absorbed by the food. The chemicals accumulate in your body and can eventually lead to cancer. Use glass or ceramic only in the microwave because they do not release any harmful chemicals when used in the microwave!!!! …",88 out of 98 users found this review helpful

I would recommend diluting this monster and not using it as a dip, like I did. Use an eye dropper to measure out Dave's sauce with your favorite barbecue recipe. You will be shocked by how little of Dave's your system can tolerate. All this dilution is a pity because there is a definite flavor to this touch of lava. At present, I can consume an entire plate of barbecue or wings with about 20% of Dave's Insanity. Actually, one of the best uses of hot sauce is a tiny dlution of Dave's with your salad dressing. I do love spicy, but there is one drawback to a plate of Dave's. Cast-iron stomach or not, the heat will invade your innards. No amount of iced beverages will tamp this sensation down. Please be careful as many people will not tolerate ghost chiles in any dilution. The biggest problem appears to be uncontrollable coughing jags. A little goes a long way. Finally, keep your dogs from the leftovers; a simple swallow could be the last bit of food your dog will ever consume. The consequences might be fatal. This is no joke. …",35 out of 35 users found this review helpful
" Made in the US version, not the same recipe as Imported from Austrailia version",3,"I thought, wow, bulk Lucky Country Red Licorice, sweet, but alas no, it is a mass produced Americanized version from Lucky Country's new US manufacturing plant. The recipe is completely different from the Lucky Country Red Licorice (same brand, same name) that is Imported from Australia. The original recipe has more real licorice despite being a red licorice, and is much softer. The Made in US version is your typical chewy waxy candy licorice with barely a hint of licorice, just pure sweet. Shame on Lucky Country for taking a high end sophisticated product and watering it down like every licorice sold in every drug store in the US. I'm heading back to Target or Trader Joe's for the real thing. …",15 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 New favorite from Annie Chun,5,"I'm totally hooked on Annie Chun's Soup Bowls. Far and away the best ""instant"" soup on the market, I find myself frequently craving the soft noodles and intense flavors found only in Annie Chun's soups. I have tried all of the varieties, and the new Vietnamese Pho soup has shot to the top of my favorites list. Very savory broth, you will definitely recognize the flavor if you've enjoyed real pho in a Vietnamese noodle house. This is not a spicy soup--if you prefer it with a kick, I'd suggest investing in a bottle of Sriracha sauce. Obviously, one of the major selling points of Annie Chun's soup bowls is the convenience factor. Nevertheless, this soup makes me want to grab some fresh cilantro and bean sprouts and have an authentic pho experience at home! Since everyone's tastes differ, as a matter of reference, my other favorite Annie Chun's Soup flavors are the Tom Yum, the Kimchi (although it's in the upper range of spicy that I can handle), and the Miso. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Causes nausea,1,"I was very excited to find a quality green tea extract. Unfortunately, every time I take it, I get very nauseous. I felt this way for 5 days straight after I began taking it so I stopped taking it for 4 days during which I had absolutely no nausea at all. The very first time I tried taking it again, I was extremely nauseous within the hour. I've even tried taking directly with food, doesn't help. I have read that polyphenols can cause nausea so I'm guessing it is the high percentage that is to blame. …",6 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Great Snack!,4,"I am generally not a fan of pretzels. I have tried pretzel after pretzel in all shapes and sizes to no avail. I finally stumbled upon these one day and I have been loving them ever since. They provide a nice pretzel taste without having an overpowering amount of salt. I only have two complaints about the product: 1. Brown rice syrup as an ingredient. While it is organic, I would rather it not be in there because of a few health effects. 2. The pretzels are coated in salt and not sea salt. Sea salt is the healthier of the two and should be recognized as such in an organic product. On the whole, great product. …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful

" As a Red Bull Enthusiast, I Highly Recommend This!",5,"This is an excellent, cost-effective alternative to Red Bull. The flavor is spot on--even though a purist may be able to notice the difference, I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal! For the price, two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this. Also, with this syrup, you have the option to how strong or weak you'd like to make each serving. I find that I can add less than the recommended amount and make this mix go even further. I think you would be hard-pressed to find a cheaper alternative that tastes so close to the original. …",32 out of 34 users found this review helpful

 Contains Chemical Sweeteners,1,"Yes, ALL Wrigley's Gums, even the ones with SUGAR, now contain at least ONE, (and many contain two or all of them) ASPARTAME, ACESULFAME-K, SUCRALOSE! WHY a gum with Sugar needs these dangerous chemical sweeteners is a mystery to me, but since they changed the logo of the packages on their gum, you can no longer buy any Wrigley's (or most other brands too) gum without one or more of these nasty chemical additives. Also note that Sucralose (AKA brand name Splenda) is NOT the same thing as Sucrose! (Sugar) The slight spelling difference is to decieve those that read ingredient labels to think they are reading Sucrose and not notice it is Sucralose. Sucralose causes severe abdominal pain, so if you have had that after chewing gum, now you know why. Aspartame has dozens of books and thousands of websites explaining what is wrong with that, as well as the other one. Very sad that I never again will get to enjoy my childhood favorites of Wrigley's Spearmint, Juicy Fruit or Big Red ever again. …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Fantastic taste - best grits around,5,"Apparently the other reviewer for this product has his underwear in a wad about the price - I don't think the other reviewer even tasted this product! Yes, Bob's Red Mill products aren't cheap, but the company fills a very unique niche (Gluten-free products, unusual flours, etc.) and I'm willing to pay the price to keep the company from disappearing. Plus, every product from Bob's Red Mill that I've ever tried has been superior, including these grits! Now about the grits - as a native Southerner, I've eaten grits all my life but I'd never had a yellow, coarsely ground corn grit before I tried Bob's. From the moment my family tried these grits about two years ago, we've eaten no other grits. We cook these grits every weekend, usually Saturday and Sunday mornings. Oh, we've tried a few regional products (Lakeside yellow grits are good, too, and more finely ground), but just not as good as Bob's. I like the more coarse grind of this product, and the flavor is exceptional. The corn flavor comes through, but not in an overpowering way - not to sound like a geek foodie, but Bob's yellow grits have a fantastic taste and mouthfeel. It's hard to explain, but I recommend you try them. If you're not sure you want to bite off a multi-box purchase via Superstore, then check your local grocery store (Publix in the Southeast carries Bob's) as do many organic/gourmet grocers. Oh, and never follow the directions on a bag or box of grits - that's the reason non-Southerners think grits are nasty, because they make them without the necessary amounts of butter, salt and milk or cream. Also, these are not quick cook grits, so it will take about 20 minutes from the time the water boils to achieve smooth, cooked grits. To feed four people (assuming you also have pancakes and a meat for breakfast), use three cups water brought to a boil, then gently shake about 2/3 cup of grits into the water. Once the water/grits combo comes to a boil, immediately lower the heat to simmer and stir frequently. [A note about lumps: if you don't stir often enough, you get lumps; if you dump the grits in, rather than shaking them in slowly, you get lumps.] Add about two or three tablespoons of butter, then an unholy amount of salt. I'm afraid to measure how much salt we actually use (we salt to taste as we cook), but I would guess we use two or more teaspoons of salt. To avoid oversalting, start with one teaspoon of salt, taste when you're almost almost done, then add salt to taste. Depending on how thick you like your grits, add additional water (we prefer to use 1% milk) to thin them out a bit. You can also add crispy bacon or country ham to your final product for flavor. Any Southerner can tell you that grits left in a pot to cool become polenta... so go ahead, and impress your Yankee and West Coast friends by ""grilling up"" leftover slices of your breakfast for dinner. Remember, the Americas introduced corn to Europe (including Italy), so grits came first. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Wake the Dead!,5,This dark roast blend makes an awesome cup of coffee that will get you ready to face the day or an outstanding espresso that even Scorsese or Cornholio would envy.

 Requires additional ingredients to swallow,3,"I'm a huge fan of Red Mill products -they're made just around the corner from where I live, so I stop in their retail store all the time. I bought the whey through Superstore because it was a couple bucks cheaper than the retail price. I hoped to use it as a replacement to bodybuilding whey protein supplements that have a bunch of other ingredients - glucosamine, creatine, sugars, etc. I give big points to Red Mill for being simple and pure, and it's important to note they are selling a base whey protein concentrate, not a protein shake mix. It dissolves relatively well into water but not as well as leading protein drinks. The taste is what's sticking in my craw - it has a very raw, difficult to overcome flavor. It's like swallowing thin wallpaper paste (consistency) that has a strong, flat taste of the milky liquid that forms in cottage cheese containers. If you're planning to mix recipes like other reviewers recommend (adding apple juice, or spinach(?), or bananas and other fruit), you'll be fine. But be aware this is not drinkable on it's own - it requires strong flavors blended with it. I'm using it in my steel cut oatmeal in mornings, and I'll cook with it, but it looks like I'll need to stick with flavored protein shakes for meal supplementation. …",65 out of 72 users found this review helpful

 Not as good as Haribo and your tongue will turn blue,3,"If you are a big fan of Haribo gummies, and have grown up eating that style of gummy, you will probably be disappointed with these. These are the large soft variety of gummy to you find in many store brands, as opposed to the small harder variety of the Haribo. You get roughly twice as many pounds for the price, which is a big plus. A big downside for adults is that the blue/purple colors turn your tongue blue, and it will stay that way until you brush your tongue clean with your toothbrush. The Haribo's don't have that side effect. As far as the fancy flavors go, that is just clever marketing as opposed to an actually benefit since none of the flavors taste as good as any of the basic Harbio flavors, in my opinion. …",7 out of 15 users found this review helpful

I hate to admit this, but I have tried these treats as well, don't judge me too much I know you have thought of it as well.

 Warning - High Levels of Arsenic,1,"I have been feeding this formula to my baby for four months now, thinking that I was providing the safest, purest formula available. Today on the news I saw a report on a study conducted at Dartmouth University that revealed formulas made from rice sugar have extremely high, UNSAFE levels of arsenic in them.

I'm so concerned about my baby's health from use of this product.

 This is best for grits or polenta,5,"Once you've made this you'll never eat instant white grits again. These grits have a rich corn flavor and need little enhancement-just a little salt and butter. I used these to make a South Carolina shrimp with grits that was the best I've ever made. They are also identical to the Italian polenta. Don't buy those silly cylinders of precooked polenta or boxed instant polenta. This product is easy to make on the stove top and ridiculously easy to make in the microwave: just bring the water to boil in a large glass container ( I like my 16 cup measuring cup), stir in the grits while stirring, along with salt to taste, and microwave until it's thick and creamy, stirring every couple of minutes. Eat it soft or cool it and cut to make grilled or fried polenta. Superstore is offering a good price also. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 A little weak but tastes pretty decent,3,"I just received this product today and although I've been disappointed with K-Cups that weren't coffee or tea in the past (like hot cocoa and sweet tea) I figured I'd give these a shot since it was only $9.99 for 24. I drank it hot, although you can also brew it over ice for a cold drink. Immediately after brewing I noticed it looked a little weak in the cup, but it smelled pretty good. My reaction to my first sip was a bit on the ""bleh"" side. The caramel taste was a little odd and a touch sickly sweet. However, as I drank a little more it grew on me. It's certainly not like heating up a nice cup of real cider from a farm, but it's more convenient, it doesn't go bad, and makes a decent little cup of cider on a nice chilly evening. For $9.99 I recommend giving it a shot. Don't go all out and buy the 3-pack of 18 cups right off the bat though. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
