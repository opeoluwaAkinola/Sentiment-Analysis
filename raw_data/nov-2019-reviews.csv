 Tasty orange soda - zero cal - and all-natural!,4,"I happen to be drinking an Orange Zevia as I write this review. :) I cannot compliment this brand enough. I've been purchasing all flavors of Zevia for the past few years and absolutely love it. There isn't an aftertaste at all, and it is simply delicious. Zevia's Natural Orange is among my favorite flavors. My other Zevia favorites are black cherry and root beer, however all their flavors are yummy! My favorite things about Zevia are that they are sweetened with all-natural stevia and do not contain any harmful chemicals. Also, I love the fact that there are not any calories in it. There are no artificial colors or flavors either. The only Zevia flavor I've seen caffeine in is cola. All the others are caffeine-free. I deducted a star from this product due to the pricey price point of Zevia. I still continue to buy it, but not as often as I would like to due to the cost. I have emailed the Zevia corporate team and they are responsive, professional, and friendly. I trust this brand. I hope you give Zevia a try. I think you will be pleased! …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" We examined their claims, gave it a taste-test, & found multiple problems with Zevia...But here's a solution! (Read on)",1,"First, my household is a low-carb, low-glycemic index, and zero corn syrup household. We have been looking for alternative *natural* sweeteners for quite some time because our doctor has serious warnings (and lots of research) against chemical-based sugar substitutes like aspartame, saccharine, and splenda. Stevia is our favorite sweetener - usually from a bottle, or as a raw leaf. The problem is, we can find very few products (like snack bars, soda, cookies, etc) which use Stevia. So we were excited to meet the people from Zevia at the trade show in which they rolled out this product (2007)... and we were among the first people in the country to taste a stevia-flavored soda! At the trade show, the company gave out mini-cans of selected flavors, and we were super impressed. The taste is different from mainstream root beer, cola, and ginger ale products ... but it was sweet, sparkly, and had a nice bite. No awful aspartame aftertaste! We came home excited to order our first batch for home/personal use. To our disappointment, we found several discrepancies between their product & literature at the trade show, and the actual product rolled out. First, they decided to add caffeine to many of the flavors (not the root beer), but this ruined most of the flavors for us & makes their ""all natural"" claim a bit disingenuous. Next, we were told by company reps that the soda contains only purified water, stevia, and citric acid. To our surprise, when the ingredients were published on the can (FDA standards), we found that the PRIMARY sweetener is an artificial chemical called eurethrytol (2nd ingredient), not Stevia (5th ingredient). Drinking a 12 ounce can of ginger root beer flavored Zevia had the same effect on me as eating 4 maltitol-based chocolate bars (LOTS of stomach problems). Finally, they claim this is a zero calorie drink, but erythritol does indeed contain calories - about 25 for the can. And at $1 per can, the price is just to high. This product was a disappointment all around. SOLUTION!! Ok, so you're wanting a safe, natural, great tasting soda without side effects? All you need are 3 ingredients: Seltzer Water, Bottle of liquid Sweet Leaf Stevia, and (secret ingredient) citric acid. Seltzer water is widely available at any grocery store. You'll find the other two ingredients at your health food store (we buy citric acid in the bulk section of our local apothecary, under $1 per ounce). For one serving of soda (12 ounce) add 15-20 drops of liquid Stevia, and just a *PINCH* (1/8th teaspoon?) of citric acid. The Stevia sweetens and flavors, and makes a very nice drink. But the citric acid adds that ""bite"" that makes a cola taste like a cola! Our favorite Sweet Leaf flavors are: Root Beer, Cinnamon, Orange, & Apricot. This method is actually much cheaper than cans of Zevia, tastes better, broader variety of flavors, super portable (we travel with a little pouch of citric acid & a bottle of Sweet Leaf), and it's truly natural! Three more notes for health-conscious people: (1) We have tried many off-brand bottles of liquid Stevia, and they are all just fine. HOWEVER, many of the off-brands use a grain alcohol base, which tastes awful in soda (unless you're used to that sort of thing! Ha Ha...). So other brands are fine for cooking, but at this time I recommend Sweet Leaf for mixing drinks (just purified Stevia + water). (2) Aluminum cans are a disaster for the environment (takes one 12oz can of gasoline to melt down/recycle 4 new aluminum cans). So I recommend bottles of Seltzer water instead. And, (3) artificial carbonation robs your body of magnesium & other things. Instead, opt for naturally sparkling water, like Pellegrino. We usually pay $1.15 for a 1-liter bottle of naturally sparkling mineral water, no additives, and it has lots of healthy minerals. GOOD LUCK in your continued journey for better health! …",111 out of 130 users found this review helpful
 This filter works PERFECT!,5,"Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the ""old fashion way"" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size. I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Superstore, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry. The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew! …",472 out of 477 users found this review helpful

 Very good for women,5,"I try to take this product on a regular basis, every day or every couple of days. It has helped me with an estrogen dominance problem (heavy bleeding) and other pms symptoms. I consider it to be a medicinal product. It is loaded with nutrients women need, like iron, potassium, etc... I love that it is organic. The best way I have found to take it is like a tea. I started out putting about 1 tablespoon in a mug and filling it with hot water, then sipping it. My favorite recipe now is to put 1 Tbsp in the mug and stir in about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. Then I add the water, leaving some room at the top. Then I pour in about 2-3 Tbsp of coconut milk and stir. This ""tea"" is rich and creamy and tastes a lot like hot coco with a little zip from the cayenne. …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 useful item,5,"I have used this in many different ways and I like its ease of use and the fact that its a pantry item. That said, it doesnt have the texture of fresh cooked chicken and Ive found it best in things where its either mixed with something - like a chicken salad - or added into soup. I dont think it works well where a genuine chicken texture would be wanted (ie a stir fry or a chunky item where the chicken is in large peices) I think this is a very good item and worth having; just be aware that it isnt a perfect substitute for fresh cooked. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Bitter...Made in CHINA...beware of potential toxins & heavy metals,2,"I have tried a couple different brands of Matcha teas, and this was definitely the cheapest, and well, ""you get what you pay for."" This tea is a dingy looking, ""pea green"" and fairly bitter... whereas other higher quality more expensive brands are brighter and fresher tasting (the brighter the tea the BETTER quality it is). Although green tea is ingredibly healthy, you HAVE to be very careful about your source since manyof the poorer quality green teas (particularly those grown in China, Pakistan, and India) contain potentially high levels of metals such as fluoride, lead, and aluminum. Just FYI...aluminum in the body has been linked with Alzheimer's disease. So if your going to be consuming green tea on a *DAILY* basis, spend a little more money for some healthy and PURE green tea! …",10 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Bob's Redmill Organic Buckwheat Flour-Gluten Free,5,"I needed to go Gluten Free recently and have found this product really made it much more enjoyable. Buckwheat is not a grain or cereal.It is a flower seed and has a lot of health benefits in addition to its great taste. So many flours like rice and tapioca are like baby powder and a lend a strange crumbly texture to baked goods. Adding this to the mix yielded dense moist flavorful breads, pancakes, waffles, muffins, cookies... I also purchased Bob's Redmill Creamy Buckwheat ""Cereal"" and the Raw Buckwheat Groats.

 For the sake of your taste buds avoid this snack.,1,"Chocolate Juniors appear to be an average tastykake comprised of cake and chocolate icing. Beware. They aren't as pleasing to your mouth as they are to your eyes (not that theres anything special with presentation of this snack). The sheer smell of the snack will make you question taking the first bite. The reason you choose these over krumpets was probably because they were half off (they're always half off)or they simply ran out of what you wanted. When I was the victim of this snack, I was hungry it was late and I had no alternatives. As you munch into the unholiness of the awful sponge of a once preservative soaked cake your eyes may glisten with regret, sorrow, and dismay. Yes you paid for this. The aftertaste is fortunately easier to deal with than blocking the memory of this horrid cake in the future. Please beware of purchasing this snack. It was one of the most unpleasant encounters with food if had in a while. The next day I shared the snack with some friends and even they too agreed on the terrible taste, and those cakes were from a box purchased in a separate store. The cake I ate was actually fresh and from a nearby factory from where it was purchased. Tastykake has no excuse to sell this product to people.

 Gas station coffee dispenser garbage,1,"This stuff tastes like the ""coffee"" you get from those vending machines at interstate gas stations or 7-11s. The first ingredient listed on the box is group of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. Doesn't bode well for a supposed cappuccino. That's followed by multiple, seemingly random sweeteners, then instant coffee, a long list of other stuff that has no business associating itself with coffee, and then (inexplicably) sucralose, which gives it a strong artificially bitter aftertaste. I took 2 sips about 45 min ago, and still can't get the taste out of my mouth. Definitely avoid. …",141 out of 162 users found this review helpful
 Nice snack that lasts!,5,"This bar has cranberries, almonds, and macadamia nuts (NOT bits and pieces!) as their main ingredients, in a soft honey-like glaze to keep it all together. I refrigerate them in the summer or they kind of ""wilt"". The ingredients are fresh, and the nuts are crunchy. What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them. Those nuts are meant to be chewed and not inhaled, unlike a lot of snacks that disappear as soon as you get the wrapper off. I can't eat one in front of my favorite dog, as this is one snack I am too fond of to share with her... much to her dismay. I think they are worth the cost, and I know they cost way more if you find them in a local grocery store. …",56 out of 58 users found this review helpful

Sure, it was a considerably more expensive than the average supermarket brand tuna, but oh my god the flavor was unmatched! Unfortunately it seems that things have changed. Beware customers, Superstore is lying to you, this is NOT ITALIAN TUNA ANYMORE. The label clearly says product of Thailand. And yes, you can definitely taste the difference.

 sauce not for mortals,5,"I purchased a burrito from a small shop a few blocks from home. I was unimpressed with their habanero ""hot"" salsa. Eager to kick it up a notch, I reached for a bottle of what I later found to be Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper Jolokia Hot Sauce. I unscrewed the top and went to put a dab on. I quickly realized that there was no flow regulation but not before a large pool of the magma colored liquid dripped into my lunch. I decided to dab my finger in it and see what I was dealing with. It was formidable, sweet and flavorful with a long heat. I thought I could take the heat. I demolished the burrito, hot sauce and all, and shrugged off the pain. Every bite was saturated with the taste of a thousand tortured souls but the guacamole still tasted great. I wiped my tingling lips and while downing a glass of water I looked at the bottle. It claimed a heat rating of ""Insanity++."" I headed home thinking surely the worst must be over. I've ate plenty of hot food and my stomach is battle tested. I was wrong. I walked no more than a block before I started to feel odd. It was in the forties in Cleveland but I could feel the sweat forming on my brow. I walked another block and I could literally feel the burning sensation outlining my stomach. My breaths were noticeably faster and shorter. People on the street looked at me weird. I figured it would go away by the time I got home but I decided to pick up the pace. By the time my apartment was in sight I was experiencing tunnel vision and it felt like a live agitated weasel had been placed inside me. I knew what I had to do. After flushing my lunch, a tablespoon of this sauce, half a gallon of milk, and my ego down the drain, I can honestly say I am just happy to be alive. This sauce is not for mortals. …",808 out of 815 users found this review helpful
 Great product at a great price!,5,"I started buying this brand of food when my dog had a litter of puppies (I bought the puppy-lover's bag).

" This is a good machine, but I've changed my opinion about the Keurig system",4,"I was first exposed to Keurig-made coffee at a luxury hotel and ran out (to Superstore) and bought a B70. I have since purchased about a dozen Keurigs for friends and family. Here is what has tempered my enthusiasm; they don't hold up over time. I don't expect things to last forever but most of the people that I have given the Keurig to only get about two years of use out of them before their pumps fail. I replaced my B70 with a Breville and it just recently passed away. Before I let myself calculate just how much money that I have spent on an ""easy"" way to make a cup of coffee I purchased this unit. Overall I am very pleased with it. It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles of my other K-cup coffee makers, but it's got enough of the features that I need (however, I do miss the clock.). One thing that is really nice is that it has a drain feature, something missing from my other Keurigs. This allows one to drain the unit of the water that is deep inside the machine, preparing it for transport or storage. The one real feature that caused me to buy this model over the others will take a while to prove itself, and that is DURABILITY. Being designed for office use the B145 is supposed to have a more durable pump. I have to admit that I am skeptical, but we will see and I will update this review periodically.

" Fabulous tasting coconut water...NOT unnaturally sweet in the larger cans. YES, too sweet and AWFUL in the small cans.",5,"I was leery of trying the Amy & Brian's again after having this experience: AMAZING pulp-free tall cans. Horrible candy-water 10 oz cans. So, I have several cases of the short cans I refuse to drink. Awful. But I went through the cases of the tall cans. Wonderful. I wondered if the inconsistencies would show up in the tall cans, and I did not reorder. THEN..this big sale and sub/save showed up. Tempted me. I ordered TWO cases of this one, with the pulp. WONDERFUL. I like it even better than the pulp-free (which is weird, as I normally avoid pulp-containing packaged coconut water). I even found myself enjoying chewing the bits of pulp.The flavor is NOT too sweet, very nicely coconutty, not at all sour or weirdly salty like the new Zico, nicer than ONE and VitaCoco. So, I feel free to order more now. Clearly, there is some issue with the smaller cans. I strongly recommend you avoid those like the plague. They taste nothing like coconut water. They taste like you dropped some generic sugar candy in water and let it dissolve. Really icky sweet and NOT AT ALL coconutty. (I have had fresh out of the shell coconut water since childhood, my family being from the Caribbean, and have tasted virtually every brand available locally and on Superstore, and I know coconuts vary according to region and even harvest areas etc. Coconut water IS variable, so I don't expect homogeneous flavor. I do expect it to be coconut water and not candy water (or corn cereal milk like new Zico)). So, yeah, avoid small cans. Amy & Brian really need to look into why that stuff is disgusting, cause it's ruining their reputation whenever someone tastes that horror. The Tall Cans: Yes, buy these. I've sampled out of four different cases sent to me, always good. The pulp-free was more sweet compared to the tetra pak CW's I've tried, and the higher carb count makes sense. I even emailed the A&B people about it, and they said it was due to the blend/selection of coconuts that theirs is sweeter with a higher carb count. I can see how the selection could do this. I like the sweeter flavor, personally, but always have with meals cause it is higher carbs. When I want to drink coconut water by itself--I choose a lower carb variety, like original Zico was or ONE in a smaller quantity than the 17.5 ounce can. Thumbs up. Refreshing, sweet, coconutty, lovely. I love, love, love this coconut water in the TALL CANS. But I beg the Amyy & Brian folks to investigate and revamp the processing for the smaller cans. That stuff is vile and I have two cases plus sitting in my kitchen that I cannot drink. (Add that to the Zico I can't stomach and preordered and that's a lot of my money going to waste cause companies can't get it right/screw with a tried-true formula).

 Great Product BUT Now Tastes Horrible!,1,"I've been using Emergen-C for years. It's one of my favorite products - a really wonderful pick-me-up in the late afternoon. I swear by the stuff. Unfortunately, like so many companies that can't leave a good product alone, they have ruined it by changing it to ""New Improved Flavor!"". The new flavor is absolutely HORRIBLE. I can barely swallow the stuff. I actually needed a water chaser. I don't know why companies always feel the need to ""new and improve"" products that they know sell well. The new flavor is overpowering and has an artificial aftertaste that lasts for at least half an hour. I am so sad about this because it's a long-time favorite and I will not be buying it any more because it's nearly impossible for me to swallow, even with my nose plugged.

 Illy is by far the best tasting espresso.,5,"After having Illy at the espresso bars in Italy, well, no other espresso tasted good to me! Illy tastes great made in a good pump espresso machine. It also tastes great made in a steam espresso machine (e.g., a low end Krups) and a Moka (an Italian poor-man's espresso maker). The rich flavor isn't burnt tasting like many espresso roasts. Everyone I've made an Illy espresso for raves over the flavor compard to espresso from chain coffee stores. A tip when brewing espresso using a steam espresso machine: Shut off the valve before any steaem comes through the coffee. The high temperature steam will leach unwanted flavors into the coffee. I used to buy Illy at the local stores, but the prices were over $11 per can, sometimes $12. I was happy to see Superstore start carrying it at an even lower price. If you can't find Illy a good runner-up is Lavazza, however, its flavor isn't as intense as Illy. …",22 out of 26 users found this review helpful

" No, it's not the same ""sweet"" as sugar but may be a good natural alternative to artificial sweeteners.",3,"The flavor of this stevia blend reminds me of artificial sweeteners. The more you use per serving, the more distinct the ""not sugar"" taste is pronounced. Of course, it has its benefits as it is a natural sweetener rather than a chemistry experiment. Given the choice of an artificial chemical sweetener or this product, I'd go with this product even though it's a little expensive. Those with diabetes or who are GI conscious may also want to explore using agave nectar. Where stevia has no calories, agave has a caloric load similar to that of honey (though it has a very low GI). Agave's flavor is fairly neutral (in the light varieties) so its ""sweet"" flavor is less at odds with the flavor of sugar. I think this product is ""ok"" - but I can't say that I like it well enough to give it 4 stars. There's no way I'd use it as a sugar substitute for cooking. It's fine in beverages, but if you have a penchant for over sweetening your drinks (southern sweet tea is traditionally very sweet, for example) you're likely going to notice the ""it's not sugar"" taste.

 The First New Flavor of the Quintessential Condiment!,5,"This was the first modern variation on an essentially unchanged, bestselling product for more than 140 years. Other flavors are: Pepper Sauce (hot) (2500-5000 Scoville Heat Units), Sauce (hottest) (>7000 Scoville Heat Units), Pepper Sauce (milder) (1200-2400 Scoville Heat Units), Pepper Sauce (mild) (1500-2500 Scoville Heat Units), Sweet & Spicy Pepper Sauce (mildest) (100-600 Scoville Heat Units), but this is Pepper Sauce (milder yet) (600-1200 Scoville Heat Units). Dueling histories of the McIlhenny Company are available: (authorized) An Illustrated History and (unauthorized) Gold: How a Louisiana Family Built the Tabasco Empire , for those curious about how this most remarkable product and business empire came to be. Note: ""A pharmacist named Wilbur Scoville invented the Scoville Scale in 1912 to measure the heat of peppers. A 'Scoville Unit' is actually a measure of capsaicin (the chemical in hot peppers that is responsible for their heat). Scoville's test was a comparative taste test that is considered subjective by today's standards. A more sophisticated method is in use today, but in honor of Wilbur Scoville, the unit of measure is still called the Scoville. The capsaicin level in peppers can vary from plant to plant due to local environmental conditions. This means that a pepper's rating is an average measure. The hottest pepper on record is the Bhut Jolokia with a pungency of over 1 million Scoville Heat Units (1,001,304, to be exact). By contrast, the Bell Pepper comes in at less than 100 Scoville Heat Units."" …",5 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Attention Chocolate Connoisseurs: Avoid Like The Plague!,1,"I should start off by saying that I have never understood the appeal of artificial chocolate flavoring. Even when I was a kid and a total junk food junkie, the things that were artificially flavored chocolate always tasted strange. Fast forward to my life as an adult and I find that neither has the technology behind artificial chocolate flavoring improved, nor my opinion of it. It still has a subtle (and sometimes, not-so-subtle) metallic taste and an obvious artificial one. So do many artificial flavorings, but most seem to replicate the real thing about 75-80% of the time. Not so with artificial chocolate. So then, it will come as no surprise that this K-Cup variety is equally disappointing. Imagine the most mass-produced chocolate doughnut with a laundry list of ingredients (and unpronounceable ones at that) and one pretty much has the taste of this coffee flavor---at best. It's not the worst chocolate flavored coffee I have ever had, but when most are pretty bad, that's not saying much. For the life of me, I can't understand the reviews of other incarnations of this product which claim that it's ""like licking the frosting off a chocolate donut"" or ""tastes like adding chocolate syrup to your coffee"". No, and no! It's also a far cry from ""cafe mocha"", as well. Come to my house and I will make you a K-Cup of coffee with real chocolate and you can have a far superior cafe mocha experience. It tastes little like a doughnut, a chocolate doughnut, and nothing like chocolate doughnut glaze and marginally like chocolate at all. If you are a fan of products from companies like Ghirardelli or Lindt, I will guarantee that you will be disappointed at best and disgusted at worst. I received this flavor as part of a sampler from the manufacturer's [GMCR] mail order program, and fortunately only received one K-Cup, as I would never place a full order for this flavor. I kept hoping it would get better, but such was not the case. It was all I could do to finish the cup of coffee and not throw it out. …",7 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 A good Choice,4,"When I'm drinking instant coffee, Taster's Choice has for years been my beverage of choice. Coffee snobs may turn up their noses at instant coffee; and it's true that nothing beats a well-brewed cup of freshly made java. But sometimes speed is of the essence and all you really need is a smooth, solid mug. Of all the instant coffees I've tried, this one is the best. The coffee itself has a very nice, rich flavor. It is instant coffee, so don't be expecting the greatest cup of Joe, but compared to other instant coffee brands Taster's Choice is by far the most appealing. I take mine with a little bit of milk or half and half (whatever I've got in the fridge) because I tend to find the coffee a little bit too bitter when it's black. One change that I've noticed and disliked in the last few years has nothing to do with the coffee crystals but is in the container. For years, this coffee was sold in a nicely shaped glass jar with a solid metal lid sealing in the flavor. Nowadays Nescaf&eacute; distributes their coffee in a tall plastic container. My objection to the change is not based on aesthetics (although the look and feel of the original is far preferable to the modern plastic abomination), but rather how fresh the product stays. In the glass container, I could have the coffee crystals sitting around for months and they would be just the same as they were when the jar was new. But with the plastic container, I find that it simply doesn't do as good a job as the glass for keeping the crystals dry and fresh. Very often, as the weeks and months go by, the crystals start getting damp and clumping together forcing me to break up large chunks of coffee crystal lumps, something which never occurred in the glass container. To solve this problem, I ended up finding an old Nescaf&eacute; Taster's Choice glass jar and simply reusing that one over and over again. Every time I need a refill, I wash out the old jar and fill it with the coffee I bought in the plastic container. I'd like to think that Nescaf&eacute; is still producing the glass jars somewhere, but if so I've haven't found them. For instant coffee that actually tastes like coffee, I've been happy with Taster's Choice. It's not what I turn to when I want an absolutely fantastic tasting, 100% pure, guaranteed to knock your socks off and touch the face of God cup of coffee, but it is what I choose when I want something right now. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 A good source for this distinctive and unique spice,5,"Piment d'Espelette is a unique product. It is subject to Appellation d'Origine Controlee regulation, which extends the right to use the AOC label only to ten communes in the Basque country in France. The peppers are grown, harvested, dried and prepared subject to strict regulation and, like wine, cheese and other products subject to the AOC, must display the typical ""organoleptic characteristics"" of the traditionally produced spice. Piment d'Espelette is never strong or screamingly hot, so if you are expecting something akin to Scotch Bonnet peppers, or the acrid bite of ""chili pepper"" blends, look elsewhere. However, it does have a sweet and smoky aroma, akin to good pimenton or paprika, along with a distinct peppery 'bite' at the finish. Piment d'Espelette is never inexpensive and it is usually not easy to find in the US, so having this source available is great. I use it in almost everything -- for example, peel and slice cucumbers, toss with a good quantity of freshly squeezed lemon juice (Meyer lemons preferred), a pinch of sugar, a large pinch of fleur de sel or kosher salt, and a pinch of piment d'Espelette. Let the cukes sit in a colander for up to half an hour, tossing occasionally, then serve. Trust me, you will not fail to notice the presence of the piment. It's also great and sufficiently assertive to dress a good sized composed salad with just a pinch in a basic vinaigrette dressing of lemon juice, white wine vinegar, dijon mustard and grapeseed, walnut or olive oil. Wonderful sprinkled lightly over a platter of carved ""rotisserie chicken"" from the grocery. Adds a nice edge to rillettes or a terrine. Adds pop to scrambled eggs, quiche... just think of anything you'd like to lend a subtly sweet, smoky and hot red peppery note, and give it a healthy pinch of piment d'Espelette. Another reviewer reports that he received piment d'Espelette from this source (""Touch of France"") that was tasteless. I've not had that experience. I received very fresh piment with the AOC labeling, with aromas and flavors that are perfectly ""typique."" If you really want to get ""fresh,"" you could go with the whole dried, corded peppers which are also sold subject to the AOC (corded by hand with no fewer than 20 peppers per cord). I like the convenience of the ground piment and recommend this supplier without reservation based on the product I received. The price is about as fair as one can find nowadays, and I bet you can double up on the order for a single shipping charge. For more about piment d'Espelette generally, you can google piment d'Espelette and you will find the ""Site officiel de l'AOC"" (alas, for some reason the good folks at Superstore would not allow me to include the URL in this review). …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Aids Digestions,5,"I used know Gelatin from Publix for an alternative source of protein. Most my meats are so high in tryptophan that I figured I was already getting enough in my diet, that I could take this as a supplemental protein also. This product tastes much better than know, also, after going to their site, it looks like this product is made from pastured grass fed cows (which is great if you are on the Paleo-Diet). Most Paleo people have heard of Weston Price. Some have heard of Pottenger. Pottenger did tests on cats and found that after several generations of eating cooked only food that they became short tempered docile, they developed tooth problems and narrowing of the jaws along with skeletal deformities. The reason Pottenger's studies apply here is because he recommended that people consume some gelatin with their meals. The reason he recommended this is because the Gelatin is similar to RAW food in its water-loving hydrophilic quality. Gelatin Loves water and Digestive Juices and if you eat a cooked meal along with some Gelatin it literally draws digestive juices towards it and aids in digestion. Because I follow a Paleo diet mostly, I eat a lot of fat (grass fed butter/coconut oil) and after a little while of stopping the Know Gelatin and waiting for this product to arrive, I noticed that my stools were gray/ashy, I did a lot of research and found that Gray is a symptom of undigested fats. From 12 hours after I took this product I was back to a normal nice brown color. I also have kind of weak/popping joints so... This product is pretty much exactly what I needed, wanted and recommend, and it tastes great, if you need a product for digestion or joints, this product couldn't get a higher recommendation from me. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 THIS STUFF IS INCREDIBLE!!!,5,"This is amazing. I like it better than all other coconut oils. Of course it tastes like coconut. I don't want to use oils that are so overly processed and refined that they taste like ""nothing"". I don't understand why the coconut flavor bothers some people. If you don't like coconut, find a different oil. You can use this for grilling, frying, baking, sauteeing, greasing & flouring a cake pan, and all other places that you'd use butter or a Crisco-type product. Just be careful on the baking because this melts at a low temperature. It is amazing as a skin softener, a hair conditioner, a leave in hot oil treatment, make-up remover, eyelash conditioner/glosser, shaving ""cream"", lip softener, cuticle oil, nail conditioner, bath oil, after bath oil, massage oil (add a few drops of essential oil if you wish), etc. Speaking of massage oil, this is an excellent product for ""adult activities"" . . . as a perk it is definitely edible. If you have dry feet, slather this on, rub it in, wrap your feet with plastic wrap, cover with socks, and go to bed. In the morning your feet will feel nice and soft. This can be used on leather such as shoes, jackets, and purses. Because it's clear, you can use it on leather products that have decorative stitching that you can't cover with regular colored polish. (In fact, I just bent over and put coconut oil on my black leather shoes with my fingers . . . the only clean up needed was to rub my hands together.) I've even used it on my wood furniture to obtain the same results as furniture oils. I have used it to grease hinges and mechanical parts. I have heard that you can use it to add lustre to pearls but I'm too chicken to try it on my good stuff. I know people that have used it as a laxative (in large quantities) and a diet aid. When I eat about a T. a day my skin is softer and my wrinkles are less noticable. I keep finding new uses. I'm sure you'll find some, too. …",68 out of 69 users found this review helpful

 Magnet gets stuck!,2,"Enjoyed upon receiving. Not a night and day difference, but using with scotch seemed to provide a smoother finish and reduce the ""burn"" quality (i drink it neat.) HOWEVER, after about 5 uses, pressing the button to release the scotch through the aerator no longer worked! I pressed it several times, to no avail - then held it in place to see if it would eventually free itself, also to no avail... poured the scotch into my glass out of the top, so that i could then shake and smack the aerator and the stopper eventually freed itself. But the stopper - which appears to be magnetic - has not worked well since, and i would inevitably have to smack it a couple of times prior to pouring to get it to work (since you can't smack it while there's anything in the glass.) Anyways, I call the manufacturer for a replacement and I have to pay to ship it to them. They pay return shipping for replacement - fair enough - but i'm still paying extra for dealing with the hassle. Hopefully the next one will not have this issue, as this seems to be the first mention of this problem. I will update if the next one has this issue.

Here's the problem - since these are marketed as a means to clean a dogs teeth, I would expect them to last a while during which the chewing and gnawing action would indeed help the dogs teeth, but here's the snag, I have a small-to-medium size dog and he went through one of these chews in minutes, whereas the HEXtra chews last much longer. There wasn't any ""chewing"" involved, the dog just bit the VeggieDent Chew and it breaks off into smaller semi-sharp shards and only chews momentarily then its gone. I would have expected these chews to have a more chewy consistency rather than a hard consistency so a dog couldn't just bite through the chew and swallow the smaller pieces. I cannot possibly fathom any benefit to the dog's teeth in terms of removing plaque or reducing tarter. I wouldn't buy these again and will stick with the HEXtra line of chews. …",38 out of 42 users found this review helpful

 Apple Cider Vinegar by Bragg,5,"What's not to love? It's apple cider vinegar! Great for cooking but I use it for other purposes as well. For example, my 9-year-old gets the occasional wart on her hands. Not sure if it is the placebo effect or if this stuff is really magic, but I put a little piece of cotton soaked in it on the wart, cover with a bandaid and leave it on overnight.

Like I said, it may be the placebo effect but if it works- it works!! And it is far cheaper than other remedies out there. Bragg's has a much better taste to me than the regular apple cider vinegars out there I've tried(for some reason, I feel like it smells better, too).

I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again.

These Frontier pieces are irregularly shaped flat slices, stuck together, and have a sharp taste, much sharper than Australian crystallized ginger even. I'm guessing Frontier got its stock from China. There is no country of origin listed on the label. I suppose I'll wait for Trader Joe's to get some Australian ginger in for my next purchase.

" If you like indian boiled tea or chai, nothing beats this...",5,"Well, nothing that comes with an brand name label beats this. There are brands that are better, but not one you'd find easily. These are not ground leaves. They are tiny little leaves allowed to dry and curl up, so expect to see almost mini-peppercorn-like granules. If you're not familiar with leaf teas, the boiling/steeping time is higher, and the outcome is very strong, so if your normal cup of tea involves lukewarm water and Celestial Seasoning, I'd let this be. Note that you should use less, but not steep it a shorter time. The full taste only develops after the leaves open up. I'm from the Indian subcontinent, and once I got this, I introduced it to other folks from around there, and they've all been sold on the taste, aroma, and body. I personally feel that's a pretty good endorsement from that bunch. Also, this is a huge pile of tea, enough to fill a 5lb bag of sugar (though of course much lighter in weight). Tetley also makes the round bags in the purple box that have a very similar quality if you don't drink tea 3 times a day. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 The One and Only,5,"I discovered this product while living in the Philippines with my wife. I was so glad to be able to find it back home in the United States in local Asian grocery stores (first in California, then on the East Coast and online). I love the TASTY HEAT that this product puts into my curry dishes. It is versatile, as I have used it to make beef, chicken, and pork curry (haven't tried to make seafood yet, but soon). This is so much cheaper (per ounce) and tastier than the impotent **** that they put in small fancy glass jars that they overprice and try to pass off as a great product. These companies (can you say Thai Kitchen) that manufacture those imitations probably survive here because most people don't know that they can buy MAE PLOY which is 100 times better. Not only is Mae Ploy tastier, it is also so much cheaper to make sauce with. All you have to do is add coconut milk (less than $1 for 14 a oz can) and/or a little fish sauce(not for me) to match (actually overmatch) the mix that the imitators sell. I also love the fact that I can vary the potency of my sauce because it is not pre-mixed with coconut milk. I once purchased a unauthentic crappy product out of desperation when I first returned to the U.S. in 2007. I used the whole jar (11 1/2 oz) and payed about $5. It was so weak and flavorless. That will never happen again as I keep it well stocked. One jar of this lasts me about 4-5 large curry meals (I always make enough for leftovers as I use two or three cans of coconut cream). So if you make a smaller amount it could last you 8-10 meals. They even make a 35 oz size of Mae Ploy that you can find (google it). Just make sure that you seal up the plastic well before using again (I also refrigerate it after opening). Bottom line though is that this is the BEST and the ONE and ONLY Curry Paste that I will ever use. I never order curry when I eat out because I know it will not be as good as the one that I make at home. Thanks to MAE PLOY RED !! Thanks for reading. Read up on this product and then try it out, you won't be dissapointed. …",32 out of 32 users found this review helpful
 Excellent Roasted Seaweed,5,"This is very good roasted seaweed. Excellent, in fact. Most companies just dry their seaweed but let me tell you, they are lazy and really don't know seaweed.

Everyone is all about speed and convenience, speed and convenience. It's like we're all on treadmills or really fast escalators or something quick and automated like that. I just don't know what is wrong with everyone. Sometimes I just have to sit down and shake my head.

 so disappoointing,1,"So, after reading every review, I checked to see that the country of origin listed in the description was Thailand. I tried not one but a replacement case as well, both a horribly greasy product from Sri Lanka. Superstore immediately reimbursed me. I had used this product before (not from Superstore) and my cans must have been from Thailand as the product is (was)so dreamy I really wanted it again. I decided to call the company because their description on Superstore is false advertising. The woman I spoke to was an absolute brat, borderline rude, with excuse after excuse. Maybe she was tired of fielding complaints, but isnt' that her job? I was so surprised because I have had such great conversations and learned so much from other small companies like that--like Nutiva (who I complained to about my leaking coconut oil and devleoped a great relationship with one of the representatives there who sent me a replacement even though I told him Superstore had already reembursed me. I just wanted to let them know about the problem. Her biggest excuse (among several side-stepping maneuvers) is that the sample sent to them did not match the product. To me this speaks VOLUMES about the lack of quality control at the company. Makes me wonder what is in those cans. So, Superstore and other poor consumers will have to suffer for Edward and Sons faulty business products until the Sri Lankan is used up 'in about another month or so'. Seriously? A small company with poor customer service is doomed to fail, no matter how great their product.

Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth. I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.

 My dog's love these,4,"I have three dogs, small (5lb), medium (20 lb) and large (60 lb) and all three of them love these chews. I first learned of this brand of chew at my vet's office, I had one of my dog's teeth cleaned and they suggested these (as well as the C.E.T. toothpaste) to help maintain the health and condition of my dog's teeth. I have used this product a little over two years. I each dog one chew (small for the small/medium dog and large for the large)at bedtime each night. They remind me every night when I go to bed by standing by the cabinet where the chews are stored. The only disadvantage, which is a minor thing but worth noting so you don't get surprised, the chews can leave a colored-residue on whatever bedding they are on while they chew it. My dogs like to jump up on my bed to eat them so I place a towel down for them to eat on so my duvet does not get soiled.

 Was it worth it?,1,"I purchased 50 Timothy K Cups, Breakfest Blend. Although we very much enjoyed the taste/quality of the coffee, half of our K-Cups were defective and released so many coffee grounds as to make those cups of coffee undrinkable. In other words, we only got half our money's worth. This is very problematic because although we enjoy this particular blend of coffee we can't afford to discard half our purchase because of defective K-Cups. It would be nice if Superstore /Timothy's made good on this purchase. At least then it would be worth our while to make another order and presume that this was an ""isolated"" defective batch of K-Cups. Otherwise, it is not worth the risk to make the order again.

" Ok, it works, but the important thing is WHY it works",3,"SUMMARY: Ok so this is a long review, but the short summary is that although i regularly consume 5-Hour energy i do so with the knowledge that the effect i am feeling is mostly from the caffeine, and this effect is the same as caffeine consumption in coffee form, this also includes the ""crash"" later. The vitamin-B's added have as far as i have been able to find very little evidence supporting any effect, and at large doses some are toxic. I buy it in general because of the convenience of the concentrated form, and the fact that it is not calorie laden to the extreme (a la Starbucks). That said i could not find any evidence suggesting that 5-hour energy has any effects which makes it preferable to coffee ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Let me start out by saying that i am an avid 5 hour energy drinker. As a university student i go through at least a few every time a major exam week is coming up. Being a Psychology student with a focus on Neuroscience i decided to actually have a look at the contents of 5-Hr and and the scientific basis which merits its inclusion in the energy drink. Drugs that affect the body are intrinsically very complicated with many different effects on different parts of the body, so this is not a complete picture and will often be a very simplified one, but i think it will do for our purposes here. Caffeine: 5 hour energy contains caffeine, this i am sure comes as no surprise to anyone. What might be a surprise is that caffeine is a drug, this only means that it has a physiological effect on the body, but it is important for several reasons. One is that there is quite a lot of evidence for the buildup of both addiction and tolerance to caffeine, most people that regularly consume caffeine do build up tolerance, requiring larger consumption for the same effect .Without getting too technical caffeine works by effecting receptors on cells called ""neurons"", caffeine is what is called a ""direct antagonist"" to adenosine receptors. That means caffeine inhibits neurons from reacting to adenosine (it sort of works like a ""cap"" on top of the receptors stopping adenosine from attaching there). this inhibitory effect ""increases"" cerebral (brain) blood flow, as well as decrease the effects of adenosine on the brain, adenosine builds up in the body over an entire day, and seems to play an important part in promoting sleepiness. By blocking these receptors caffeine temporarily reduces the feeling of being tired. It does however in no way reduce the need to sleep overall, as adenosine is still building up in the body even when you have consumed the caffeine. It is like being under water, caffeine can act as a ""air bubble"" isolating us from the water for while, but once the air is used up you still need to deal with the water, in the case of adenosine, this means sleeping. The ""crash"" after caffeine consumption is simply the neurons again being affected by adenosine, so you are now feeling how tired the body really is, as caffeine has built up while you have been under the influence, the subjective experience is from a higher high then you were before to a lower low. The importance of this is that as far as i know there is NO WAY to remove this effect, unless more caffeine is consumed. As such the claim that there is ""no crash later"" sounds very disingenuous to me. There is also conflicting evidence as to whether or not caffeine improves mental alertness or just increases cognition in addicts back to a non-addict baseline, however as far as i know there is no consensus in either direction, and i am not willing to spend hours interpreting the papers dealing with this issue. Various vitamin B: There is a lot of misconceptions out there as to what vitamins actually are. Vitamins are defined as any organic compound needed in tiny amounts that the body needs, but does not produce. So by definition we need Vitamin B, however that does not mean taking lots of them is good for you. Its a bit like saying ""well the body needs carbohydrates to survive, so the more i eat the healthier i will get"". So the question is not if vitamin B are effective (they are) but if they have an effect in large doses. Virtually everyone gets all the vitamin B the body needs, the one exception is usually pregnant women and vitamin B9.In general there is little to no evidence of positive effects on cognition or attention after consumption of any vitamin B, vitamin B is liquid soluble so most of it simply passes right through the body. The one *possible* exception is that there are some exploratory studies finding that vitamin B6 consumption in children with ADHD leads to better attentiveness and cognition. However these studies (at least the ones i was able to find) are generally small (30-50 participants) and thus unreliable. Even if there was a link this would most likely be linked to a specific deficit in people with ADHD, not the population as a whole. I also found several meta-analyses (papers reviewing other papers) that suggested no link between vitamin B6 (or B12) and increased cognition or attention. There is however a danger associated with some vitamin B's if consumed inappropriately. Overdosing on vitamin B6 and B3 is toxic to the body, so don't consume more than 2/day (recommended max from 5-hr themselves) for extended periods of time, it is well documented that vitamin B3 overdosing is associated liver damage in large quantities, while vitamin B6 is associated with nerve damage at high quantities the FDA sets their upper daily limit at 100mg which is roughly 70 times their recommended dosage, a bottle has 40mg B6 so you can do the math from there. Energy Blend: So this is the shortest section because there is not really a lot to say, Glucuronic acid is sometimes used for more effective delivery of drugs, but doubtful that that is effective here. The much touted Taurine is also a non-story with the EFSA (think european FDA) stating that there is no effect positive or negative from the levels presented in energy drinks. at least one study suggests Citicoline might have some positive effect on memory in people with dementia, but i was unable to find a study which dealt with a healthy population. So why do i continue to consume 5-Hour? even though the vitamin B has little proven effect, the caffeine does, in the sense that it acts the way one would expect it to. I consume it because it is more convenient to bring around then coffee, is consumed faster, and tastes quite good (in my opinion), and at $1.70 a bottle, its cheaper than Starbucks and far less unhealthy. …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Chocolates might be great; shipping was less so; customer service is great,3,"While it was shipped to me insulated in styrofoam, no cold packs were included in the shipment--which was heading to Atlanta in early September (the American South in the summer). I assumed that since I was paying over $20 for shipping--the absolute fastest time, greater care would be taken to ensure that the product arrived intact. Unfortunately, the chocolates I received were largely melted. I do not recommend the purchase of this item to be shipped to any region experiencing temperatures above 78 degrees. UPDATE: Received an e-mail, which read (in part) as follows: First, my apologies for not answering you earlier... I didn't notice there was a melting issue with your order till late last week while addressing a small more recent delivery problem. Anyway, as you have noticed with your order, melting can and does happen in transit, but luckily only with an insignificant number of our packages as we only experience about two dozen or three dozen a year out of well over 15,000 packages. Insignificant when view in percentage terms, but still most infuriating when this happens. The e-mail went on to note that they are replacing my order. I am stunned--I have had a melting issue before with a different chocolate company (remember, I live in Atlanta, Georgia, where summer temperatures are a bear), and I received nothing in the way of satisfaction. I figured it would be the same and didn't even bother to directly contact the company (a mistake on my part).

 Excellent Source of Magnesium,5,"If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too. I've also tried a flavored version of this product (Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder). Unlike that version, this stuff is entirely odorless, and the only taste is a sense of tartness. I much prefer this non-flavored version over the flavored version. The only problem I have with this product is that it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage. That's pretty insignificant. So, I still rate it at an Excellent five stars out of five. Highly recommended. Especially if you're taking calcium. …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful

I like that I can just put in the tiniest of splashes in my drink and just have a hint of flavor... or splash a lot in and get a real flavorful experience. It's a quick and easy thing to use. It's also fun to watch it splash into the water. I've also found it's good to flavor different types of alcohol. In regards to the criticism by other reviewers for it containing propylene glycol - don't be in a panic like them. propylene glycol is harmless unless ingest massive quantities of it. Using a canard like ""it's considered harmful to pets so humans shouldn't ingest it!"" is just alarmist behavior. Chocolate is harmful to dogs. Better not eat that then! Lastly, in regards to it having so many ""food colorings"" - well, if you don't like anything that flavors your water to have anything artificial in it, squeeze a lemon into it. Put a dash of sugar. Or just drink the water plain. You know what you're getting into when you buy this stuff. Bottom line: This is my new favorite drink flavoring.

Garbanzo flour to the rescue and this brand is the best I've ever had. It held the patties together fully as well--or better--than eggs did. I'm a happy camper. BTW, I do the ""throw together"" method of cooking. Ingredients are quick oats, garbanzo flour, chopped fresh mushrooms, chopped onion, Braggs, coconut aminos, olive oil, garlic granules, Italian seasoning, sea salt and enough water to combine everything. Baked them on an oiled cookie sheet @ 350 until brown, turned once. The mushrooms keep them moist. YUM!! …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" This is NOT DECAFFINATED COFFEE, Green box doesn't mean Jack",2,Green Mountain now colors the box light green but this product is caffeinated. Wife got Snookered caused she thought Medium roast didn't have caffeine; just cause the box was light green. Don't you get fooled too. Coffee had a bitter taste had to put MORE French Vanilla creamer in it to make it have a smoother taste. ( that was medium roast) Going back to Newmans Medium roast Decafe..by Kuerig. …,2 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 COMMON GARDENIA PROBLEMS and their solutions,5,"I've bought three Bonsais from BRUSSELS BONSAI in the last week, and I have to tell you, i'm impressed by the service, and the quality of their trees. I've had about a half decade experience with bonsai, and considering that an old bonsai is anywhere from 75-150 years old, I'm STILL a neophyle. However, a neophyle in Bonsai can still have lots of experience with gardening, and I have that. The first thing I'd say to those who hesitate to purchase a Gardenia after reading the bad reviews here, is I seriously doubt that ANY problem you read about is from the plant, but rather the plant's caregivers. GARDENIA IS NOT A FIRST ATTEMPT BONSAI. If you want an easy plant, get a Chinese Elm, or a juniper. However, lets say you have a Gardenia, and you dont want to commit bonsai hari-kari, then here are some suggestions. 1. These are tropical plants, zone 8-11, and don't thrive below 50-59 degrees. Everything i've read says to protect from drafts, give them LOTS of light (Southern Exposure), using a grow light, or florescent light in the dead of winter if nessacary. If you have it on a windowsill, you might turn it around, so the back faces front from time to time. MAKE SURE IT DOESNT GET TOO HOT OR COLD. 2. As tropical plant, THESE PLANTS REQUIRE HUMIDITY. More humidity than you will get with a humidity tray placed under your pot. I've sat a tray of water next to the plant as well. This is obviously a big problem in winter in the north, where dry houses are common fron central heating. PLANTS WONT FLOWER WITHOUT PROPER HUMIDITY. (or the flower buds drop off, right before flowering.) 3.DO NOT MIST. The people who complain of yellow spots on their leaves, got those spots from either allowing water to sit on the leaves, or from misting the plants. Misting also leads to leaf rot. Obviously these are VERY TEMPERMENTAL PLANTS. You need to provide enough water, too little or too much, and your leaves will drop off. Water less during the winter, and keep well watered in the growing season, and hot, sunny weather. 4. FERTILIZE the plant with an azalea plant food (ACIDIC/high nitrogen). Do this in the spring, dropping to a low nitrogen food in the summer. I've read that the plants enjoy getting fed thru their leaves once, during the spring. 5. INSECTICIDES. The gardenia gets scale insects that suck the sap, also white flies and aphids. You can pick off the bugs if just a few. I've seen people use flypaper to grab gnat like pests, tho a weak insecticide if you have too many bugs to pick off by hand. Gardenias can also get mildew, from the high humidity, which will require removing the infected leaves, and even using a fungicide if nessacary. 6. PRUNE this bonsai only if it's lost all shape, and then after flowering, careful not to remove next season's buds. Stems with 6-7 leaves, can be trimmed by hand back to 3 leaves. Repot them in early spring, making sure the soil has NO LIME (acidic soil lover), and is free draining and fertile. Personally, I think you can get away waiting til the plant is completely pot bound. TAKE NOTICE! These plants need a fairly constant tempurature, tho some writers say they can require cooler nigthtime tempuratures. These plants are so tempermental, that even moving them around, can cause them to have problems. Its no joke that plants appreciate prayer and gentle talk, tho that might be because you are close to them, breathing CO2 on the plant, which they breathe in. It's not a bad idea to research these plants on line, where you'll find lots of websites filled with gardenia suggestions, youtube videos, and helpful hints. GOOD LUCK BONSAI LOVERS! …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Guess I'm in the Minority,1,"I was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews, I took a chance. Well, no one in the family likes this stuff- it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce- more like what it says it is- Chili Sauce. Now I'm stuck with two huge bottles. Sometimes reading the label is really all that matters. …",2 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Delicious and addictive!,5,"I too am a big licorice fan and these are really great. I am glad I took the other reviewer's advice and froze it in small bags. Otherwise, it would have been eaten too quickly as it is highly addictive. I just ordered another batch because I don't want to be without it when the cravings hit! If you are a licorice fan, you will not be disappointed. Definitely a cut above what you can find in stores. …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 New Favorite Dark K-Cup,5,"This coffee has a smooth, carmely, dark finish that I love! My husband gets other dark blends that taste like charcoal to me. This one is very smooth, with just a hint of sweetness. I wish that Superstore had it on its monthly purchase program, would love to save 15% on it! However, I was glad to find it someplace besides Green Mountain. As prime members, we can get our coffee replaced in 2 shipping days v. a week or longer over at GM. Sweet! …",27 out of 29 users found this review helpful
