 Sweet - don't need much.,4,"All you need with this is a sprinkle...if that. It does sweeten everything - and is good if you have diabetes or just want to avoid sugar. Too much and it turns bitter tasting on ya, so not too much. Some people think there is an after taste...or an off taste - but I don't. No, its not going to taste like a mouthful of real sugar...but it does add sweetness / like you know, diet coke is sweet but it not coke. The powder can be messy, the drops are easier - but both cumbersome to carry around with you (big disadvantage). The little packets of this (and they make them) contain maltodextrin - which I avoid...a filler with a high glycemic index (basically corn starch) so know that in advance. And the packets some of them contain INULIN which is a fiber - and that can cause painful gas. This is all I know - I hope its been helpful. Should you try it? Yeah. Don't toss it after your first go'round with it though - give it another try and another until you learn how and when/where it will work best for you. If you want to cook with this please learn about that on the web - I have no idea about measurement conversions for this. Enjoy. …",24 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 No worries about plastic leaching,5,"I wrote this to ease the worries of those who read some of the lower starred reviews complaining about the plastic container and possible ""leaching"" of harmful byproducts into the oil. Turn your Nutiva jar upside down and read inside the little recycle triangle. See the little ""1"" symbol and the PETE written under it? That's a good plastic: ""#1 is Polyethylene Terephthalate, also marked as PET or PETE. Companies normally use this plastic for various beverage containers such as water, soft drinks, and sport drinks. You can also find this plastic for ketchup, peanut butter, salad dressings, jellies, and various other condiments. This plastic is known as one of the ""good"" plastics since it is not known to leach, or gradually penetrate, chemicals into the products it houses."" [...] Also, don't worry about the clear container--coconut oil is highly resistant to becoming rancid from heat/light, unlike olive, corn, and other oils. Enjoy. …",59 out of 61 users found this review helpful

" Delicious with 5 spice aromas, not full of sugar and cream",5,"This India Spice Chai while brewing fills the whole room with wonderful aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves almost like the Chinese 5 spice blend. There is no added sugar or cream so if you want that go with Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack . Those k-cups which are delicious as well have the cream that many expect in a chai tea. This particular brand of Celestial Seasonings is just tea. You can add what you want after the fact. I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing. This is just a nice cup of spiced tea. It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most.

 Different effects for everyone!!,5,"Please be aware that this product, like any other supplement or energy drink you can try, will have different effects for each user. To think that it would react the same for everybody would be saying that everybody has the same exact body shape and health, metabolism, etc. Personally, it works wonders for me. I am 20 and in fit shape, and it does a perfect job of keeping me awake and focused at work. I drink one on days when I didn't get enough sleep the night before, and within 5 minutes I can go from stumbling around with heavy eyes to being alert and productive. For me personally, there is no crash afterward, I simply return to however I was before I took the drink. My only concern is the possible long-term effects, but since I do not use it on habit, just on those days when I really need it, I am not really worried about it. Highly recommended, but do not feel scammed if it doesn't work for you. It simply might not be as effective on your body. …",23 out of 31 users found this review helpful

 1 star for the hydrogenated oils and the ridiculous price.,1,Good powdered creamer but geez Nestle ... have you heard all the negative buzz about hydrogenated oils? While everyone is moving away from this toxic stuff it seems the Nestle execs are asleep at the switch. As for D&B Nutrition who is selling this through Superstore - have you found someone actually willing to pay this price? This 50 oz container sells for $5.99 ($4.99 with an often available coupon) at the big box stores. How could this seller possibly think someone would pay 4x the price for the same size? Why bother listing the item for sale at all at this price? I love Superstore but I do wish they would remove 3rd party selling items priced such that they are little more then a waste of space and insult to the shopper. …,43 out of 53 users found this review helpful

" Light, flavorful, healthy and satisfying",5,"I'm a bit granola obsessed, always on the search for a great tasting and healthy blend of ingredients. With reasonable effort to avoid hyperbole, Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters might be the best granola I have tried. The diverse grains are sweet and crispy, the nutrients are plentiful, and the price is right. I generally eat the granola dry, straight from the package, but I have eaten it with almond milk, making for a delicious, nutritious breakfast. For those who are curious, here is a breakdown of the nutritional content, as well as ingredients: Serving Size: 1/3 cup (29g) Servings Per Package: About 11 Calories: 120 Calories from Fat: 30 Total Fat: 3g (5%) Saturated: 0g Trans Fat: 0g Cholesterol: 0mg Sodium: 20mg (1%) Total Carb.: 22g (7%) Dietary Fiber: 5g (20%) Sugars: 5g Protein: 3g INGREDIENTS: Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), citrus fiber, citrus pectin. The blueberry flavor is, perhaps, a little too subtle, getting lost in the mix of the grains, but it does make its presence known. The variety of grains included is more robust than many other brand I have tried, especially the inclusion of quinoa. So there is a little something to please everyone. So, for those seeking a delicious, healthy granola blend, I highly recommend Kind Vanilla Blueberry Clusters. For my money, it may be the best grain blend on the market! …",36 out of 37 users found this review helpful
 Great Satisfaction,5,"We served this juicy but very sassy bunny at a party for friends including Sir Elmer Fudd, Wile E. Coyote from the Arizona Coyote family, Pete Puma, a gentleman from Tasmanian, Samuel from Yosemite CA, and a man named Marvin who likes to dress as an ancient Roman. Unfortunately a Doctor friend and his very long red-haired assistant with tennis shoes could not attend. Neither could a gentleman from Africa who is taking care of a newborn bundle of joy the stork just delivered. In any case, everyone at attendance was extremely satisfied. The meal was a big success compared to the duck we had last year. Everyone agreed it was gamy and daffy. Next year we are going to try something Southwestern.

 Remarkable stuff,5,"I just logged on to place my Maca order for 3rd time; this time will order two bags. Maca is a remarkable product. If you check you will find this is a great price for organic raw Maca. I have not tried other Maca products but frankly feel no urge to do so as I am quite pleased. Lot's of the negativer reviews compain about the taste. I actually like the taste (in smoothies and mixed into my hot quinoa cereal -- I must have some affinity for Andean food). But my wife finds the taste positvely revolting. So it seems to be a personal matter. I think it tastes like roasted malt with a nutty flavor that is very earthy. The impact on my health -- some increased stamina, altertness, and a very positive feeling of overall physical wellbeing -- has been quite remarkable. Having tried many herbs, supplements and healthy foods over the years this is quite unlike anything else I have tried. It may be that my body resonates particularly well with it. Obviously others don't have the same experience. But it may be worth a trial. …",37 out of 40 users found this review helpful
 Never again,1,"I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch. I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor. Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion. I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away. …",8 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Best instant coffee available in the USA.....period,5,"Unlike Europe where instant coffee is a huge and diverse marketplace, with Nescafe, Krona, Douwe Egberts, Maxwell House and more having umpteen products available, here in the USA there is very little choice. I'm not going to get into the instant vs. real coffee debate here, and this is an instant, so don't expect a Starbucks red eye latte. For convenience and taste however, there is no comparison to Mount Hagen (which is made in Germany incidentally) - Nescafe Gourmet series probably comes in a close second, but flavor and aroma wise this is head and shoulders above Folgers and Community brands of instant coffee, or any others for that matter. More and more people are drinking less and less coffee (we're all trying to be healthy remember?) so if you don't want to have the coffee pot on the hot plate all day, and can't afford a one cup at a time Keurig, give this a try. My only complaint is it's a little pricey, but until we have some others available in the USA to compete, I'll pay it. 5 Stars. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Mostly hype,1,"I love Lipton's Mixed Berry and Orange Passionfruit Jasmine green teas, so I was very excited to see these new flavors. Not being able to decide which to try, I bought all three. Couldn't wait to brew up a cup of Red Goji and Raspberry. Noticed there wasn't a lot of fragrance when I opened the bag, but thought well maybe it'll release when brewed. Blech! What a disappointment! The predominant flavor is strongly the bitterness of green tea. Since then I have tried all three of these new ""Superfruit"" flavors and I am extremely disappointed in every one of them. The Purple Acai and Blueberry one has the most fragrant smelling teabag, but the results are just as disappointing. Despite all the hype and the pretty packaging, there is very little flavor to any of these except for the green tea flavor. Looking for someone to give this stuff to, because I really won't drink it. By the way, I drink a lot of tea and a lot of different kinds of black, green and herbal teas, and I do know Earl Grey from Irish Breakfast and rooibos from chamomile and yerba mate'. …",20 out of 29 users found this review helpful

 DO THE MATH: $5.70 each!!! Can YOU afford this?,1,"Be sure you understand they are asking you to give them about $40 for only **7** squeezies. That makes them nearly $6 each!!!! For fruit sauce??? There are SEVERAL other brands which offer the same thing--pureed fruits and vegetables in soft squeezy packages that can be sucked out by toddlers in carseats--and they are selling for around $35 for ***24***packages of squeezies. See that difference? The stuff tastes just as good, I've tried them. In fact, the broccoli one of Ella's is disgusting, in my opinion. I like the brand that starts with a ""P"", second word Organics. Not the bunny. These get one star for pricing. The star is given because the product is nice, but 4 stars are taken away because of the complete highway robbery of offering these in a pack of only 7 for $39.95.

" Not bad, not great either.",3,"I purchased this coffee because both the Newman's Own and Sumatran Reserve were priced up near $1 per k-cup this month, and I needed something dark and bold to replace them until the prices came back down. This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish. The caffeine content is acceptable. The package could have been treated a little better during shipping as there were lots of dents, crushed corners and sides, and evidence of bending on the sides of the k-cups. None of the cups have thus far shown a broken seal though. Overall this is an acceptable extra bold style k-cup, but there are better options out there. My favorites have been the Newman's Own and the Sumatran Reserve. I haven't tried the Black Diamond K-cups as they are a bit pricey right now also. I'll probably end up using a coupon and buying my preferred flavors in a brick and mortar store nearby for a better price, or ordering some Coffee People 50-count extra bold flavors. Their boxes have had pretty stable pricing for the past 6 months or so. If you are out of options, this is a cheaper substitute for a pricier extra bold flavor. I wish Superstore could sort out their supply issues and keep K-cup prices a little more stable. Lastly, I wouldn't buy these again if I had other similar priced options. TL;DR - These are okay, but go for other extra bold flavors if they are priced about the same. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

But I add it to everything--my morning protein shake, yogurt, Gatorade for the gym, etc., etc. and still I have yet to make a dent in the bag.

 Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil - IF NOT BLOOD TYPE O,3,"Actually, I'm more disappointed with my research into unrefined coconut oil than this product. Through my internet research, I was assured that this product would take care of my cholesterol. After eating 3 tablespoons every day for a couple of weeks, I noticed that I was becoming very lethargic and I started to have chest constrictions. I was also giving a spoonful to my 4 year old daughter. When I saw my daughter start acting dumb, it confirmed that my lethargy wasn't accidental. I quickly stopped giving her and myself any coconut oil to eat. I don't exercise enough but my daughter runs around like a top all the time. She gets plenty of exercise and this seemed to slow her mental abilities regardless of exercise. My chest constrictions have gone after two weeks without coconut oil. We only use it to moisterize dry skin. Right after I doubted the effects of this product on cholesterol, I did a more thorough internet search and discovered that blood types O did not do well with coconut oil and it is best to avoid it. Guess what. One third the population in America, including my family, has blood type O. So coconut oil may help - if you don't have blood type O. …",7 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 i used to love these bags,2,"i first found out about these bags several years back and before i found them available on Superstore. i have been using them for at least 4 years and while i love the concept and the product lived up to the expectations at first, my last two batches have really made me wary of their use. i have a 40 lb dog and a 70lb dog. i agree with the reviewer that sometimes with the medium sized dogs with a bigger, messier amount, the size of these bags doesn't quite cut it. however, i carry extra and just use another if there is a larger deposit. to my dismay, my biggest beef has been with the reliability of these bags lately. the last two orders of 4-packs that i have ordered have split open, either along the seam on the bottom or just along the crease on the side. it's happened several times that i am just walking along and the poop flies out from the bag behind me, in front of me, off to the side, wherever, due to a burst seam. i cringe at the thought of a bag bursting open and getting fecal on my leg or on my dogs. my dogs are well trained, loose leash walkers who flank my legs so it's not like there is crazy activity on my part with regard to momentum/inertia. i thought double bagging would be a solution but have found that even triple-bagged, the seams burst. i think i have found a replacement biodegradable solution and am sad that i cannot stay with this product. i am not sure if the recipe for the starch bags has changed over the years or if i am getting really old batches (just like rubber bands, every product has a life-span) but due to my reluctance to get poop on my person, i have to switch away from these. …",42 out of 42 users found this review helpful

 Just try it,5,"Many vocal critics of illy coffee have never actually tasted it. As Dr. House says, everybody lies and illy is apparently a very popular thing to lie about. I've caught several vocal critics lying about illy (by serving it to them, getting the typical ""This is fabulous!"" reaction, then telling them what they're drinking. You know, the Folger's Coffee Crystals technique). Why is this? Well, on the surface illy does appear to be frivolous and therefore an easy target. - It's very expensive, especially for coffee that comes in a can - It's got a very fussy, very European marketing envelope around it - It tends to be sold in fussy, trendy stores - Because it's roasted and packaged in Italy, it is always several months old when you buy it - Did I mention that it's very expensive? As a result, it's easy to dismiss illy as an elitist, ""image"" product that can't possibly be worth what it costs. And it's easy to convince others of the same thing, whether you've actually tried illy or not. The truth is illy is really superb coffee, just about the best I've ever tried. Since I've started drinking it at home, I've found I'm actually drinking much less coffee overall, because I only know a couple of places that serve illy locally and I just don't feel like bothering with anything else, at least most of the time. The ironic net effect of this is that illy may actually be saving me some money! I don't know if illy will be worth what it costs to you. There are some very good coffee beans sold by Costco for roughly 1/5 the price, much better than anything you can get at Starbucks or Peets. (In fact, if Starbucks or Peets is your idea of really good coffee, stop reading this now. Not because I think you're some tasteless ****, but because those brands are in the very modern, very successful mode of bitter, over-roasted, burned-tasting American coffee and I don't personally care for that. So if you like those brands, you're probably not going to like illy or any coffee that I like. Personally, I like the bottomless cup of Peerless my favorite diner serves much better than Starbucks.) What I do know is that if you like coffee enough to own a decent grinder and other caffeine paraphernalia, you really ought to try illy. In particular, if you like light-medium roasts but find most are just too wimpy, you may just love this stuff. If not, you'll at least have a cute, fussy little can you can sub-divide some of your Costco walnuts into. And that is something. …",27 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************,2,"First off, the initial arrival: It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat! Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary. Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective; 1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces 2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several. 3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging. In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags. Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's. Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way. But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Superstore charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping). If you wanted to buy using Superstore Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings. An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats …",1 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Great salt,5,"This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a ""rounded"" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Grit in quinoa.  Bob's Red Mill Over Charges,2,"5/05/2010 Update. I am sorry but I have to down grade my review yet again. I found grit in this quinoa for the third time while eating today. I am shocked, I have never had this happen with quinoa before. Very unpleasant experience to be chewing and get that awful gritty sensation and sound between your teeth. It doesn't happen every time so I guess there are clumps of it in areas of the bag of quinoa? Now I'm stuck with the remainder of this bag plus the three remaining bags I don't know what to do. It's too bad because the flavor of the quinoa is really good. ********* I am on a gluten free, vegan, nut free diet and Quinoa is a very easy way to get protein so I eat it a lot and can not afford to pay a high price for it so, originally, I was so happy to find it here at a more affordable price than at Meijer. Quinoa is NOT cheap to buy anywhere that I can find here. When I bought this the other day I thought that it was a good deal but was disappointed to find that I had over paid. I will be going to Trader Joe's in future where I have found quinoa that is just as good as Bob's Red Mill and just as well washed but is over one dollar a pound cheaper. I might try the Eden Organics brand that Superstore carries, it is almost a dollar cheaper per pound, hopefully it won't have grit like Bob's Red Mill. Bob's Red Mill is really over charging on all their products. No need to be so greedy Bob's Red Mill. So many products they sell, like dried chickpeas and chickpea flour, I can get for half the price or less from Patel Brothers Indian Grocers. Even Meijer has dried chickpeas for less than half the price of Bob's. I will be canceling my Subscribe and Save on this product. …",11 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Something has changed. Quality control must have slipped as far as being organic goes.,2,"We have been using Newman's organic dry dog food for over 5 years...it was a Godsend when we discovered it. Our little Jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching...after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief. Then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities...so we decided to go organic...all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the Newman's. However after giving glowing reviews for many years, we now have to concede something has changed...our little Jack's itching returned to the point of drawing blood. It is clear something changed and I believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was...we are on the hunt again.

" Yum, yum!",5,"I fell in love with the taste of lingonberries because of IHop which offers a dish of Swedish crepes/pancakes served with lingonberry butter and preserves. The combination is divine. Now, because of Superstore, I just received an order of Hafi Lingonberry Preserves and can order Swedish Pancake Mix, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) and create my own version of IHop's marvelous dish! Ah, the taste of lingonberries--subtle, light, elegant, yet fruit-luscious in each spoonful. Items like preserves and cheeses can be served two ways: ambient room temperature or chilled. I prefer the ambient taste--the chill retards the full flavor. So what does lingonberry preserves taste like? Not strong like blueberry preserves. Not exotic like blackberry or heady like grape or tart like raspberry. Subtle. Sweet enough but nothing near cloying. Perfect. Until the pancake mix arrives, I'll have lingonberry preserves on homemade biscuits. Yum, yum! Note: As this is a product of Sweden and shipped from Sweden, I must mention the packaging. The jar was double-wrapped in bubble wrap. And as a little treat came a tin of peppermint lozenges. Delightful! …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Awesome quality cacao nibs - powerful and satisfying.,5,"I'm a certified chocoholic with a weight problem. I had heard that cacao nibs had all the health benefits of dark chocolate (way more, actually) without the sugar and junk food aspects. They are loaded with antioxidants and have those powerful endorphin releasing stimulants. They are also quite high in fiber (but also in saturated fats). I got my big pile of Navitas Naturals nibs and dug right in. Well - these are a bit of an acquired taste; but once acquired, they really satisfy. Cacao nibs are broken pieces of raw whole cacao beans that have been fermented and dried (and that's it). They are brown, with a dark cocoa smell, and a seductive texture that's partly like a coffee bean (crunchy and hard), and partly like a piece of chocolate (buttery with a crisp and then melting fat). The flavor initially gives you a cocoa hit and then a winey fermented flavor that is hard to describe. The aftertaste is bitter like baking chocolate. Like a coffee bean, there's some fibrous grit with the aftertaste after the creamy fats have dissolved on your tongue. My first impressions was ""phew - that's disgusting"". The winey flavor was off-putting and the bitterness in the aftertaste was hard to take. That didn't prevent me from immediately having more, however - as the crisp rich creamy quality made me want more. After a few pinches (maybe 3/4s of a tablespoon) I was flying! I mean, these things are POTENT. They really are loaded with all those endorphin releasing stimulants - and man they wake you up and then make you feel loved. Over the next few days I kept a big baggie of these in my pack and ate them whenever I wanted a cup of coffee. The stimulant effect is totally as strong as coffee - and more. To go with the speed, there's a feeling of well being and intellectual stimulation that's seductive in the extreme. I began to almost enjoy the odd powerful flavor. My only concerns at this point are whether these are addictive! About 1/2 way through my bag I have yet to hit a stem or a stone or an inedible piece (unlike what I've heard with some other brands). The flavor and texture is pretty consistent as I work my way through too - pretty good for a totally raw organic product. I found that I could grind them up into powder in the blender and use the powder to ""cocoa"" up various foods (especially ones bearing some sweetness). For example, after my workout I'd put a tablespoon of nibs and a tablespoon of chia seeds in the blender and grind nice and fine and then toss in a fist full of frozen blueberries, a glug of Walden Farms zero calorie chocolate sauce, 8 oz water and two scoops of whey protein powder (chocolate flavor, of course) and then blend. It all whips up into a rich chocolatey blueberry shake that packs the nutritional wallop of a steak dinner with omega 3 oils, TONS of antioxidants, and a wicked emotional and blood sugar pick-me-up. You can buy the powder pre-ground, but I imagine the goodies keep better in this coarsely cracked version. All in all - I think of cacao nibs as much as a drug like coffee as I do a food. People who eat ultra-dark chocolate for the health aspects should absolutely check nibs out because my body tells me they have WAY MORE of the chemical goodies of chocolate with far less sugar and fat. They also are brimming with a rich raw cocoa flavor that's weird and wonderful and hard to describe. If you are bent in this way - this stuff is wonderful. …",218 out of 220 users found this review helpful

 CHOCOLATE IS HIGHLY TOXIC.,1,"I was a big fan of raw chocolate, in fact I have ordered from Navitas for their cacao powder. However, I have recently found out that cacao powder has the highest source of THEOBROMINE which a neurotoxin. Having cacao powder on a CONSISTENT BASIS has been shown to cause tremble, sweating, nausea among a list of other side-effects. So essentially, you are harming your brain when eating chocolate. You might be very surprised to learn of these side-effects as I was myself but please do your OWN RESEARCH and you will come across same conclusions. Even the natives in South America never used cacoa as supplements. The fresh fruit from that comes from cacao plant(aka theobroma plant) is what the natives eat and use for making drinks. The fruit is harmless but it is the seeds inside the fruit, which are used to make this powder or any chocolate, that are extremely harmful.

 Super food - ultimate protein - body building - for food sensitivities,5,"I am lactose intolerant. Eggs give me crazy gas. I don't eat meat. Nuts give me gas. Beans give me gas. I also body build. That leaves me with little options for protein. Luckily there is hemp, and this is the part of the plant my body needs most. As stated in the product description hemp is the plant kingdoms gold standard, much like eggs are the gold standard in the animal kingdom. And really the two are very comparable. Hemp is much cheaper though. It dissolves very easy in water, unlike egg protein. It is easy to digest, unlike egg protein. It tastes great, and is quite mild, almost nutty flavor -egg protein always tastes like **** because they always put artificial flavors in, which make no doubt about it, are chemicals that are bad for your body. The hemp + fiber variety Nutiva makes is too gritty for me. This 50% protein is more expensive because more of the fiber is sifted out. Being a vegetarian I get plenty of fiber as it is anyway. I eat probably 6 heaping scoops (like a standard protein extract measuring cup) of this stuff a day, and never get sick of it. It's great between meals, or with meals, or mixed into meals, and you can mix it into almost anything because of the quite neutral flavor. I recover from workouts faster. It never gives me gas or makes me feel bloated. It has little fat, and the small amount of beneficial healthy fats it does have are needed to build muscle. Since this is plant sourced protein it also has anti-oxidants I am sure, it's green color is a testament to that. I could not be without this product. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 High hopes dashed,2,"On the seemingly endless search for a better alternative to traditional clay litters, I had high hopes for Green Tea Leaves Cat Litter due to the number of positive reviews regarding the product. Upon opening the bag I found the litter had a pleasant woodsy-tea odor that was not overpowering. The pellets (they can't be called in any way, shape, or form granules) are lightweight and of a comparable size/consistancy to Yesterday's News cat litter (or rabbit food pellets). Upon pouring the litter into the pan, waves of dust bourgened from the box. Although the manufacturer describes the product as ""low in dust"", it is anything but. In fact it's worse than many clay litters. The dust didn't end after the initial pouring either; every time the litter box was scooped, the waves of dust made a reappearance. My poor kitties must have a hard time breathing everytime they dig in this litter, and it's probably one reason why they dislike it so much. The other likely being the consistancy. The litter does clump well, and the odor control is good, however trying to put myself in the cat's paws I had to pose the question; would I rather walk on a sandy beach, or a rocky one? The answer is obvious; sand, of course. Hence, it's not a big surprise to find that the cats really do not like this product. There is also alot of tracking of the pellets outside the box due to their light weight and size. In summation: Pros: - pleasantly mild woodsy-tea odor - clumps well - lightweight Cons: - hard pellet-sized litter that annoys felines to the point they avoid the box - high dust - high tracking If the manufacturer ever makes the pellets into smaller sand-like granules I'd be up for revisiting the product, but for now the cons far outweigh the pros for my household. Unfortunately, we have to give the product one thumb and two paws down. …",44 out of 48 users found this review helpful

But I did it late in the day on a Friday (for a birthday the following Wednesday) and was perturbed to see the order wouldn't go out until the following week. Then I got an acknowledgement email that said it would not ship until Tuesday, with a two to six day delivery window, i.e., Thursday at the earliest. Sigh! To my amazed and more-than-pleased surprise, the flowers were actually delivered on Tuesday! According to my sister, they come direct from Honduras, Holland or Costa Rica ... hers came from Honduras. And that's the small part of this five-star rating. The flowers were absolutely fresh, lavish/plentiful, beautiful, with wonderful colors ... everyone in her office raved about them, with one woman able to specifically identify a special Honduran rose she was familiar with. The price is great, too, especially in view of what you get. I certainly know where I will be ordering flowers in the future. My sister, too. We're both completely thrilled and pleased. …",30 out of 31 users found this review helpful

 What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical,1,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands. This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi. Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering. The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much. While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal. Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products. Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money). Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer. One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer. Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail *Concentrate Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99 Liters of product per container 12 Flavor/l $0.42 *Carbonator Volume of CO2 130 Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99 CO2 cost per liter $0.23 *Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter Equipment cost $89.00 Equipment life (years) 5 Discount rate (cost of money) 8% Liters per month 10.00 Monthly amortized cost $1.80 Cost of equipment per liter $0.18 *Water Cost with Brita Filtration Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004 Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95 Brita cost per liter $0.0373 Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377 (assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration) ***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2 SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73 Without filtered water: SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65 *****What does CO2 Really Cost???? THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW *Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit) weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2 cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35 CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams *Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation losses: 10% available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85% net accessible CO2 of total: 77% usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams *Output carbonated liters of water: 2,479 cost per liter in USD$: $0.014 *SodaStream Output SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product) Cost per refill: $30.00 cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231 *SodaStream Markup Economics ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534% math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing This is an incredible 1500% markup Pros Saves plastic Allows flexible mixture of flavors Cons Cost of output is not compelling Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit ***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times. At the time of this review, I did NOT have an investment in SodaStream either short or long. In the past, I have both owned the stock and shorted it (bet against it). I may be on either side of the trade by the time you read this -- I am not very sentimental. …",31 out of 36 users found this review helpful
 Not the best quinoa option,2,"I have tried several brands of quinoa and this is my least favorite because of the bitter taste.

 Amazing Grass Amazing Product!,5,"I have been using the Berry flavor in smoothies regularly for about 10 months, and Superstore is the best place to get it. The first couple of times I tried it, it was okay. By the third time, I was really looking forward to it in a yummy way and missing it if I didn't have it. I started on it after a friend was treated for breast cancer, and her cancer doctor told her to get and stay on a green superfood. My husband had lung cancer and needed all the help he could get. I researched green superfoods on the Internet, and preferred the contents of this one because it had both fruits and veggies (most have only veggies) with great extras and minimal filler. I bought all the flavors to test, but he didn't like the smell (friends say it smells like wheat grass) and refused to try any of them. My daughter and I tested each and preferred the berry flavor in daily smoothies. The chocolate flavor tastes good, but has less fruit/veggie value. In blender: approx. 1/2 cup of orange juice, 1 banana, squirt of honey, 5 +/- frozen strawberries and Amazing Grass green superfood. Add ice cubes if you like it thicker. It's great! On the cancer subject, I studied cancer survivors and what they attributed to their survival. Result: Consume lots of Flax Seed or Whey, lots of fruits/veggies, remove stress, and remove white sugar and processed foods from the diet. Cancer loves white sugar and fake sugars (Splenda, etc.). The American diet is killing us. Amazing Grass Green Superfood contains flax seed along with lots of natural antioxidant and immunity building fruits and veggies to ward off illness. I used to average two colds per winter. Since taking this (10 months), I can't remember the last time I was sick. My body feels good taking it, and yes, it does keep you regular in a good, natural way as it flushes the toxins out of your system. Just what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately, my husband refused to do any of the things learned from my studies and he succombed to cancer. I'm staying on the Amazing Grass Green Superfood because I don't want that to happen to me. And because it keeps my body feeling good. …",29 out of 30 users found this review helpful
 Transcendental - you gotta try it.,5,"I'm a bit of spice hound and have flirted with other hot sauces before, but nothing has ever seized hold of me like Sriracha. An old Greenwich Village burger joint near where I worked at NYU used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer. The memory haunted me for years before I finally picked up a bottle. I shouldn't have waited. This stuff is amazingly addictive with a garlicky sweet hot yumminess that's hard to describe. It sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and I've drained a bottle in a 3 month period. Incredible on eggs, superb on burritos, utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegitable dishes from the Chinese restaurant. I put a squirt in the health low-sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up. Utterly highest recommendation. I, personally, do not buy the 28oz size - even though it's almost the same price as the 17oz size. (it's not a total freebie - Shipping is a bit higher on the 28oz). While Sriracha has preservatives and doesn't need refrigeration it does oxidize a bit and at the pace I use it the bottom third of the 28oz gets a bit stale for me, while I suck the 17oz down while it's still fresh. If I lived in a house with more spice hounds (I'm the only one around here) or if I were cooking with it more often in larger recipies the 28oz would be a big bargain. …",55 out of 56 users found this review helpful

 Bread-Machine Bargain,4,"I run my automatic bread maker at least twice a week, so I go through a lot of yeast. I measure out my own dry bread mix according to a couple of recipies and store it in the freezer. I mix five batches at a time. To start the machine on any given day, I just reach for a single-batch container. When I am putting up the dry mix, I am committed. I have to be sure I have enough of each ingredient to start with. Having a pound of Saf Instant Yeast on hand saves me from running to the store for the little 4 oz. jars or fiddling with teensy-weensy foil packets, which are just the wrong size. I store the instant yeast in the freezer, too, by the way. I don't worry about ingredients much. I add a tablespoon of vital gluten to each batch to make up for any deficiency in the flour. However, there is one ingredient that has to be perfect: the yeast. If it ""don't go,"" I've wasted the first batch. Then I have to get good yeast and go back and add it to unused batches. Been there; done that! I've bought three one-pound bricks of Saf Instant Yeast in the last couple of years. They have given consistent results from first to last.

 Excellent AND HEALTHY! Better choice than Campbell's,5,"I was looking for a healthier alternative to my favorite Campbell's soups (Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Chicken). I was THRILLED when I saw Pacific came out with these condensed soups! Yay! I bought them on sale and the price was only .50 more than Campbells. So I gave it a try. They are excellent! And a lot more healthy for you than the competition. Here is my rebuttal to the person who gave this soup only 1 star: I have the box in front of me right now. It DOES list the sodium content. It's 850mg per serving, and there are 3 servings per box. I also have the Campbell's Cream of Chicken nutritional values in front of me. The sodium for Campbell's is 870 mg, which is more than Pacific's. Campbells has about 2.5 servings per can. (See for yourself: ) Here's the deal. Not only are you helping the environment by choosing Pacific's soups, but the list of ingredients are way more healthy for you.

" Please Superstore, NEVER STOP SELLING WHEAT GLUTEN! Wheat meat rocks!",5,"I am soooo glad they have Superstore in the age of gluten free mania. People who dont even have celiac disease are avoiding gluten and making this awesome meat substitute ingredient scarce! THANKS Superstore! I made some wheat meat with this mix and it was great! Why spend tons of cash on gimme lean when you can make it at home? The answer is NO REASON! If anyone is curious look up wheat meat online, you can boil gluten and then you have a quality meat substitute! SOOOO cool. I am not always a vegetarian, but it IS healthier- I am about 90% veg these days and gluten has saved the day. It is healthier for my body and the environment- and thanks to Superstore I can make wheat meat! yay! PLEASE dont stop selling this! These boxes are just right, they are an affordable starter pack for making your own wheat meat. You can add about a cup of water and your own seasonings per package and you knead it into a very very dense ball.It is great when it is really dense. You can twist it and make it into more of an oval. Boil for approx 2 hours, cool. Once it sets you can get an idea of what you are working with, it is a lot like many other meat substitutes. So cool. (UPDATE: I tried adding TVP, dont do it! Hah ha... Herbs are one thing, but your TVP will fall out, its a mess. Unless you want it to -which it is actually kinda cool because it makes the wheat meat hold sauces easilly... If that is what you want, little holes from falen TVP -go right ahead. Its a cooking tactic I suppose!)----I am so excited! Try adding marinades in the place of water. However much you use it should be dense (very) yet still pliable. After a test run on the first box you will be able to see how you would like your own texture. It does take about 1.5 to 2 hours to cook, so batch cooking is a must. After it is completely cooked you can refrigerate and it seems even better after it has been cold. It browns very fast after it has been refrigerated. Re-cooking in various forms is so fun! Stir frys, anything. Buying more gluten, may end up with this brand again because it is so afforadable. …",41 out of 44 users found this review helpful
 GRITS-Girls Raised In The South!!!,5,"Mountain Southern Sweet Perfect Iced Tea, 22-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers I'm a TRUE Georgia Girl!! I know how sweet southern ice tea should taste. Well this Chick is no longer in Dixie. I've been searching for the perfect sweet tea for the past 5 yrs. Anyone who has made southern sweet tea the old school way, knows that it takes a lot of time to get the consistency just right. Once that's done the tea goes fast, thus the cycle continues. This tea is awesome!! Keurig makes it easy! Just keep in mind the K-cup is not REALLY sweet. Southerners call the tea itself ""SWEET"" not because of the suger but because of a particular taste. (This is a hard point to get across if you are not accustomed to drinking many different sweet teas down south) I use a glass pitcher, fill a fourth of the pitcher with sugar, then fill the entire pitcher with hot boiling water. Stir with a long spoon...(careful it will be HOT) until the water is completely clear. It's what we call a SIMPLE SYRUP down south. Before you brew your K-Cup, drop a splash of simple syurp in your glass or over your ice. The Sweet Perfect Ice Tea will then truely be PERFECT! FYI: If you live up north like I do and crave ice tea all year round...You'd better stock up on your K-cups by end of summer.

 Why would anyone buy these?,2,"I bought these to try out based on good Superstore reviews which made them sound like some kind of wonder bars that were healthy and would make you happy for eternity (or something). I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain: These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like ""gluten free"" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat). In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients. Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing. …",2 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Vino Italiano Wine Kit - Valpolicella,5,"I've commented on the Vino Italiano Motepulciano kit, and this review will have some of the similar info. I really like the Italian reds, and the Valpolicella the best of them (I am currently racking my 4th batch of the Valpolicella). If you make the kit by following the instructions, it will turn out dry. I drink dry, but my preference is for a wine to be slightly dry, so I make modifications to the program. I have just started my 15th kit so my experience level is getting up there. I've done kits from a couple of other companies; Wine Expert, and Vino Vida. I've bought kits from other online companies, from a local brew hut, and from Superstore. I'll continue to buy these kits so long as they are selling them at this value. You cannot beat the Vino Italiano Kits. They are complete with everything, delivered to your door with free shipping, and they make a really good wine. Let me back up and say first that a wine I like may not be good to someone else. We each have our own preferences. I've had many a wine served up at restaurants with price ranges of [...] to [...] a bottle. And the wine I am making now I like better than pretty much anything I've tasted from the restaurant, or the store. I have tried the Valpolicella, Shiraz, Reisling and the Montepulciano from Vino Italiano. I have made a couple merlots, some white zinfandels also, but from other companies. I prefer the reds, and made the others because my kids requested. I'll typically, but not always, spike the kit with additional sugar to up the alcohol content slightly. If you follow the instructions, the initial specific gravity comes out around 1.080-1.084. By adding a couple pounds of sugar in the form of corn syrup or simple syrup, you get to around 1.09 or better. That usually will give a final ABV of 11.5 - 12%. Other things that I do outside of the kit instructions include adding 1 cup of black oak chips, 1-2 tbsp of vanilla extract, and a lb or two of some black cherries, blue berries or black berries (found in the frozen foods section at the store). Lastly, I like my wine not so dry, so I'll back sweeten just as I am bottling. Again using corn syrup and usually between 8 - 16 oz per 6 gallons. To me the corn syrup seems to be better than simple syrup, but that's just my preference. I love the stuff. Currently my production is having a hard time keeping up with my consumption. Cheers. Dec 31, 2010 Update!!! We opened several bottles of the Valpolicella over the holidays. This is from wine that I made in March 2010. With every batch, I retain 2 - 5 bottles and let age somewhat. Usually I drink the rest, beginning immediately after bottling. The wine is pretty good, even though it is pretty young. Let me state for the record, this is my preference and everyone's taste is different. Make/drink what you like, and don't let anyone tell you its wrong... The Valpolicella that we drank over the holidays had aged about 9 months, and I must say, it was very good. The aging had made a good wine even better. For the most part, I followed the instructions included in the kit with some additions. In this batch, I had added 2 lbs of corn syrup and about 1 1/2 cups of black oak chips to the kit at the start of the fermentation process. The alcohol content, after 2 weeks of fermentation, calculated to be around 14.7%. A little high, and no doubt due to the added corn syrup. I racked the wine, clarified and aged it another 4 weeks before bottling. And when I bottled the wine, I back-sweetened with another 1 lb of corn syrup and added some potassium metabisulfite (1/4 tsp dissolved in 1/2 cup of water to preserve and prevent after-fermentation). This wine has received the most compliments from family and friends. I just ordered 2 more kits and will try to replicate the recipe (I keep a wine log of every batch so as to capture the important points of the good, and the bad!). I hope this helps with your wine making and you enjoy the fruits of the vine as much as I do... Cheers. Sam May 2012 Update!!! I have made a couple of changes to the recipe that have been an improvement. First, I included the recommendation from another review that said to make the kit to only 5 gallons instead of the 6 gallons that the recipe calls for. Sure, you get 4 less bottles of wine. But, this improves the fullness of the wine and its finish. Secondly, I boil 2 - 4 ounces of dark oak chips in a quart of water for 5 minutes. This is then added to the juice and then diluted to the 5 gallon level. Be sure to let the whole solution cool to 70 - 75 deg F before the yeast is added. Add the oak chips and all the liquid! This really improves the flavor, adding a powerful oak flavor that smooths the final wine and improves its overall taste. I have incorporated both these steps into all the Vino Italiano wine kits. …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 Delicious Asiago Cheese!,5,"I first tasted the Asiago cheese in this snack box when I got one of the larger boxes of snacks in the mail.
