" Far and a way the ""Best Buy"" in truffle oil",5,"""Full strength"" truffle oils (as opposed to olive oils that claim to have truffle flavor but are much weaker) often cost $6-$10 per ounce, so you'd better hope you're getting a far superior product to this one to pay several times as much. For the most part, you aren't. No matter what they call it (truffle flavor, truffle essence, natural flavors related to the truffle) all ""truffle oils"" - every single one of them - use fake flavoring, specifically 2,4-dithiapentane. This is the main flavor compound found in truffles, similar to how vanillin is the main component of vanilla beans but can be made artificially. A few oils do contain tiny amounts of real truffles, but it's just for show; a ""pure"" truffle oil would require hundreds of dollars worth of white truffle just to make a few ounces of flavored oil. If all truffle oils rely on the same compound that can be made relatively cheaply and consistently, how do the ""better"" truffle oils justify the higher price? First, they package them in fancy looking tiny bottles. Second, they use Italian olive oil as the base oil. The goal is to suggest (falsely) that the truffle flavor comes from real Italian truffles. So while it's true that some truffle oils taste better than others, this is mostly (perhaps entirely) due to the quality of the oil used. La Tourangelle uses organic safflower oil, which is nearly flavorless. On its own, it does tastes more ""chemically"" than olive-oil based oils. If it took a lot of truffle oil to flavor a dish, this might be a serious weakness. But in reality it takes just a few drops to flavor a dish, so you're usually going to add additional fat anyway. You can put your savings towards the premium oil of your choice. Besides, in some dishes (eggs or mushrooms cooked in butter), you might not want olive oil flavor anyway. One caution/tip: like wine, ""truffle essence"" oxidizes and changes flavor. So unless you plan to use the whole bottle within a month or two, it's best to keep the air out. I filled several glass ""airline size"" whiskey bottles with the oil and use one at a time. I also keep the bottles in the refrigerator, as heat and light speed up oxidation. …",59 out of 60 users found this review helpful
" gritty, unpleasant texture",1,"I was really excited to find this salt, because it is supposed to be so pure, but I was really disappointed. I realize that the company refers to the grit as mineral, but to be honest, the impression I got was of trying to eat after a sandstorm. Possibly I got a particularly sandy batch, because after I gave up on eating this, I used it for bath salt, and the tub looked like I had been to a beach party. To be clear, for me it isn't the idea of dirt that bothers me (I have used clay-based toothpastes), but this grit doesn't even break up and is unpleasant to chew. All in all, I'll stick to Himalayan Salt. …",6 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Fine Ooolong (Wu Long) Tea,5,"Sometimes I feel like I've been on a diet forever. Of course, I haven't been -- I've been on and off one or another, then back again. I don't believe any tea is a wonder cure for everything, but I find tea helpful in managing my appetite, my stress levels, and outlook on life. I drink this Oolong tea, really enjoy it, and suspect it helps me feel less hungry in the midafternoon. I've heard it's rich in anti-oxidants, and promotes the burning of fat. It may well be. I've lost bodyfat and weight -- but, again, I believe the result are due to a combination of factors that includes regular exercise, counting calories, and taking time to for a deep breath and a warm cuppa. …",29 out of 31 users found this review helpful
 Rather weak and non-descript tea,2,"There are several other Stash teas that I've tried and enjoyed. But this one is sort of feeble-tasting. Up until now, I've gotten the Yogi Tea Egyptian Licorice Tea Organic Egyptian Licorice, Tea Bags, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) and that one actually has a bold licorice taste. And it is that one that is serving as the point of comparison to this Stash tea. Keep in mind that I don't add honey or any sweetner to my teas, so they have to stand on their own. This Stash Licorice Spice has a weak licorice taste and a weak spice taste. I have to use TWO teabags at a time (which makes the seemingly low price not so much a good deal). …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

I have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels.

 Good Price For Popular Gift,5,"I bought this for my parents as a Christmas gift. It was a big hit and immediately brought with it reactions of, ""look at this one"" and ""I'd forgot about them"". One thing that shouldn't be forgotten is that after all the trips down memory lane, you actually get to eat the candy. My strongest reaction to the box when it arrived was shock over its size and weight. It is huge. I expected to pay 15 dollars for the candy and 15 dollars for novelty. But I honestly think it has close to $30 worth of candy in it, if not more. Usually, when items are created to tug on the sentimentality of buyers, something is lost in the actual product. That isn't the case here. It is both an exciting gift and a practical one. …",128 out of 134 users found this review helpful

 Everyone is right somehow,4,"I was reluctant to buy this product because of all the bad reviews and I thought maybe all the good reviews were put there by the families of the team who concocted this product. Just the other day, my co-worker gave me a chocolate brownie made with erythritol and I enjoyed it and I waited for a weird aftertaste and I waited for any laxative effect. Neither. I was the grocery store today and I picked up some sugar-free Oreos and then I saw this bottle of sugar-free Hershey's chocolate syrup and then I instantly thought back to all these reviews. As a lowcarber, I use stevia in my soy milk, my hemp milk, my tea and my coffee. I think stevia is TERRIBLE with chocolate. All the chocolate products out there are usually made with maltitol and sucralose mix, which I do enjoy. So, if there was such a product out there like this, I would buy it. I don't have the explosive diarrhea or upset stomach or other related episodes that other people have with maltitol. Maybe they consume A LOT more than I, or maybe I'm special. Having tried recently the chocolate brownie, I thought what the heck. I mixed in three teaspoons of syrup into my soy milk and I absolutely thought it was GREAT AND DELICIOUS! Those naysayers were exaggerating! The flavor was not as sweet as I expected, but that's okay since most commercial products are way too sweet, just like the sugar-free chocolates on the market. So, I thought it was genius that it was just sweet enough. And when you go low carb, everything starts to taste too sweet and obnoxious after awhile. I did notice a slight bitter aftertaste that was not attributable to natural chocolate. The bitterness was fleeting and not unpleasant, so I didn't mind it. The lingering taste in my mouth is a slightly sweet chocolate, not a chemical taste. The aftertaste didn't taste natural though, so if you're the organics-only type, then you should not buy it. I was ready to side with all the five-star-raters but I wanted to be sure, so I took a teaspoon of chocolate syrup and ate it straight. All of a sudden, all the one-star-raters were right: it was sour!!! So, these people were right too! It tastes terrible out of the bottle. So, I say this to all of you, if you are a lowcarber or a diabetic and you're looking for a chocolate treat in the form of a drink like chocolate milk, for example (though milk has carbs so why would you want to drink milk? Add it to unsweetened soy milk or hemp milk), then by all means get this. It's great. Whatever you do, don't be tempted to eat it or pour it down your throat. Otherwise, you will think it's gone bad and you will throw out a treasure and close your world off to sugar-free chocolate syrups forever. Sure, Hershey is trying to make money out of an increasingly hard niche market to cater to, but at least they know about you and your needs and are trying to make you happy. I thank Hershey's for that. So, give this product a chance. And until they come out with an organic, carb-free, non-diarrhea-inducing syrup with a pleasant aftertaste and mouth feel, this is a compromise I can deal with. I hope you will try it and see the value in a product like this. …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 Seems like exposed to too high a temp.,3,"I got these on a Gold Box and was about the same price as our local stores. Unfortunately the Reeses PB cups were flattened and appeared to have been exposed to a temperature above room temp. Since I am in the midwest and in the 60-70 temps, guess the storage in the Superstore distribution location may have led to the softening/melting. The delivery was quick and packaging was great. So my only conclusion is the candy left the fulfillment center without proper temperature controls when stored. And must likely rough handling before I even ordered it. Spoke with Mateo at CS. He is going to try to make sure that they follow the temp guidelines. If you have a similar Hershey product, please return it. I probably should have. But more concerned that others did not have the same issue. Hopefully Mateo can help with that! Happy Halloween everybody! …",17 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Never again,1,"I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch. I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor. Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion. I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away. …",8 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Not what it seems,1,"Although this is marketed as a coconut product, it really isn't. People seem to be having success baking with this. Now, coconut flour is delicious and tastes great in many substitute recipes, but does not have the same consistency or taste as wheat flour. When I saw all these success stories I grew suspicious. I looked up the ingredients for this and the first one is white rice flour. Coconut flour is the fourth ingredient (after potato starch!). Each serving packs a walloping 46g of carbs. If you are not necessarily gluten-intolerant but just living a low-carb lifestyle (Primal, Paleo, Atkins, Ketogenic, etc.), you'll want to avoid this. …",25 out of 33 users found this review helpful

 Best value in Automatic Espresso machines,5,"Vienna Plus is my third fully automatic machine. I loved my first, Saeco original Vienna, hated the second, Saeco Incanto classic. The original Vienna worked for 3 years every day, making consistently good espresso before the pump gave. I should have paid for repair, but I succumbed to that stainless steel twinkle and went for Saeco Incanto classic. More expensive for sure. Worse, better said inconsistent, coffee quality, constant small problems relating to built quality concerning the brew group, the grinder and the steamer wand. After a year of irritation a pump seal has failed while making espresso, nothing like a small explosion in the kitchen in the morning, I tell ya. Well, gone back to the trusted Vienna, now with the plus in the name. Good old days are here again .... Compared to previous- it is a lot quieter, when both grinding and steaming, it is also a lot quicker to warm up then before, steam is ready a mere 15 seconds after pushing the button. Espresso has a beautiful rich crema right out of the box, I didn't have to experiment with grind setting at all. The steaming wand (Panarello) has been redesigned and is now foolproof maker of perfect frothed foam. For the newbie I would like to add that I spent a lot of effort to find the right roast - tasted more than a few before I settled on one (Peerless Coffee Espressp Perfection) that I buy now in 5 lb. bags and keep in the freezer. I should for fairness add that I never want any other coffee through the machine like some decaf or flavored stuff, so I don't miss the alternate ground coffee option that Incanto had. My priority has always been flavor and consistency and that the Vienna Plus delivers. My friends drive miles to ""see me"" and, by the way, get a cup of espresso, praising each one as ""this is the best espresso in the world"". If that is what you desire, don't get mesmerized by stainless steel shine or computerized display magic and save yourself some money by getting this machine. You won't regret it. And I am unanimous in that. ;) …",85 out of 91 users found this review helpful

 Poor Quality...at first,5,"I messed up and bought a few boxes of these, and now I realize I can't return them. We've easily had to throw away half of the pods.

The coffee is not that great either for the pods that do work. UPDATE 7/7/12: The company sent us free replacements and I'm happy to say we have had no issues with them. Coffee is pretty good too. Got to admire a company that reaches out to unhappy customers and fixes the problems.

" Amazing Quick Healthy Breakfast, and Vegan!",5,"Original Mix (I prefer this one because there is no added sugars) Taste: In a green smoothie: Changes the texture of the smoothie just a bit, nothing too noticeable or annoying. Also adds a different flavor to the overall smoothie that helps enhance the taste when combined with the right greens and fruits. With Almond milk: I am not used to eating sugars and processed foods, so this actually tastes pretty great to me. I saw some earlier reviews complaining about taste and I honestly have no problem slowly sipping on this shake as I drive to work in the morning. I have tasted some horrid protein shakes in the past and this one is delicious! Overall Feeling: I feel fantastic after having Amazing Meal in the morning. Completely clear minded and energized for the day. Even without the accompaniment of a multivitamin, this meal powder stands alone in providing a days worth of energy and clear minded thinking. Cons: I found that I needed to get used to the added probiotic that is apart of the meal. I found myself for the first four or five days, starving only 2 hours after drinking one of these shakes. It was like I couldn't get enough food, I had to eat every two to three hours to stop the hunger. I am unsure whether it has to do with the combo of probiotic or the digestive enzyme that is added. Like I said though, after 5 days that feeling of starving all the time went away. It now fulfills me completely. Overall: This is the best meal shake I have come across thus far in my search for the perfect morning/ after workout shake. I have tried many from whole foods and other various health food stores. The fact that I have decided to actually buy another container of Amazing Meal must mean I really like it! I've been taking it for 2 weeks and, this wasn't my initial intention, but have lost 5 pounds.

 great food,5,My dog and foster dogs have done well on this food. It is the best priced quality grain free food there is to my knowledge. Superstore's price beats my local stores (including Petco when you factor in the sales tax I pay when I buy in the store). As an Superstore prime customer I was thrilled to see this included in free 2 day shipping- absolutely can't beat this deal! Superstore shipped it in a cardboard box about the same size as the bag and it arrived with the box looking quite the worse for wear. Since Wellness comes in a Mylar bag the bag itself was fine and I was home so brought it right in. If you were not going to be home when this was delivered and your deliveries are left outside I would be concerned about other animals getting to it. Even with the Mylar bag my dog can rip into this in no time flat and racoons and rats (I live next to a wooded area!) love dog food! Probably not a big deal mid-day but just something to consider. I would not buy food that ships in a paper bag from Superstore- at least not a larger bag (>15lbs) but that is just my experience/opinion. I am thrilled that Superstore offers this and would order again from them but will make sure I am home when it is to be delivered. …,16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Some Like it Hot,5,"You can keep your spicy, deli-style, French, dijon, honey, pomegranite, yellowy mustards. I want my mustard the way mustard was supposed to be--hot. It's supposed to clear the nostrils when you've got a cold; it's supposed to have a certain sensation as the vapors rise through the nasal membranes and spread to the eyes, the ears, and the rest of the face. And I've been sorely disappointed with many mustards that claimed to be three alarm, hot, spicy, or all three and didn't even ring my bell a tiny-teeny. But then I discovered this little yellow heat in an unassuming bottle. Ahhhhhh! My search had ended. Mustard is as mustard does--or something like that. It seems to activate on ham and bread. A gentle aroma becomes more pungent as the mustard hits the taste buds on your tongue and in your mouth. That's when it's gustatory brilliance takes over making the ham or cheese come alive with flavor. Colman's is the way mustard was intended, to awaken the senses and jolt the central nervous system. It might not be for everyone though. If you prefer that strange yellow sauce, honey spread, or a bottle in which you can make funny designs on your hot dog, this is probably not for you. And being a Yankee born and bred, I can almost understand how people below the Mason/Dixon line spread it on their hamburgers. I said--almost. Besides, what they put on ain't Colman's. It's the big mustard in the little bottle. It's made for wings, sandwiches, dips, tenders, and clearing your sinuses. Be gentle with it because it won't be gentle with you!

 can form part of a breakfast; cheaper elsewhere,4,"These breakfast biscuits/cookies come in three flavors - oat, blueberry, and apple cinnamon. Each wrapped container contains four biscuits/cookies that are generously sized and oval shaped. The golden oat flavor reminded me of a graham cracker that had been paired with oats. The flavor was pleasant with a slightly sweet component. I think the product is best when paired with tea and a piece of fruit. I did not experience increased energy and when eaten alone the product did not keep me full very long. When paired with a banana or apple and some almonds, I could see these cookies being used as part of a quick breakfast. The product has a good bit of fat and sugar.

 LOVE THESE -- my favorite reusables so far.,4,"Bought these to supplement my growing supply of reusables....I have many of the freebie, typical fold-up, boxy, grocery bags from various stores, but they aren't washable, so I have been looking for alternatives. These Waste-less bags are, so far, my favorite. I also have some flip and tumble reusable bags, which are also GREAT, but don't hold quite as much as these -- though I prefer the longer handles on the Flip and Tumble bags, the handles on the Waste-less Bags are sufficient to sling over my shoulder as long as they aren't filled to capacity. The fabric is light-weight but strong, and they conveniently fold up, literally, to pocket size with a nice little velcro strap to secure them. I keep a couple in my purse and also in my diaper bag...wouldn't leave home without them. For an idea of size and capacity -- I fit 5 boxes of frozen waffles and a 3 lb. bag of fruit in a single bag today. LOVE these. The price is right, so why not? Update, post washing (2/15/11): OK, what started off as a 5 star review has to drop to a 4. I just washed one of the black and one of the magenta bags for the first time after they fell in a puddle of mud in my garage. They washed completely clean and remain as functional as ever, but the green design on the black bag COMPLETELY disappeared in the wash. Well, to say it ""disappeared"" is not entirely correct. It showed up on the rest of my laundry as little green flecks and pieces. Shoot. Ah well, nothing's perfect...and like I said, I still love these for the functionality.

" Eucalyptus Oil, really?",1,"My cats loved these treats. I loved these because they are cheaper than the CET brand, and neither of my cats had any trouble eating them. Why the single star then? Well, because I can no longer give them to my cats in good conscience. They just recently changed the formula to include eucalyptus oil, which is toxic to cats. And it's listed not once, but twice. I have an elderly cat who has chronic renal failure, and there is no way I am giving her anything that is even the tiniest bit toxic. Maybe if I had 2 young cats I would be less concerned, but as it stands, there is no way I will buy these treats again unless they change the formula back. I still have the packages from the last order I bought, and there is no eucalyptus oil anywhere in the ingredients. I have no idea what they were thinking when they added a well known toxin to their formula, but I will be buying the CET treats from now on. …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful

My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 I loved it,5,"I popped some last night and I love this popcorn. If you like large poofy kernels then this is not for you, but I like small kernel popcorns too, and this one was light and a little crunchy and had good flavor. I think the selling point of this type is that the hulls shatter when it pops (""hullless""), so that you don't get the big painful pieces of hard popcorn hull in your teeth like with larger varieties. I think the popcorn kernels have to be small to be hullless. If you have an air popper and find that small kernel popcorns fly out of it, you could try a different cooking method - I just pop mine in a saucepan on the stove (with a little bit of vegetable oil, and a lid to keep it from flying out), there are also air poppers that don't let the popcorn fly out, or I've seen a microwave bowl that's like air popping but with the microwave as a heat source (but no added oil or anything, like air popping), or some people even just use a paper bag in the microwave (I think with this method they use a little oil too). There are many ways to cook popcorn, and instructions are pretty easy to find on the internet if you need them. …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 Great for lamingtons!,5,"This is the best tasting shredded (= dessicated) coconut I have found anywhere in the USA. It is organic and sulfite free. This is the unsweetened, finely shredded, very small pieces of dessicated coconut which is used in South East Asia, Australia etc. This is not the same product as American style coconut, of which the most common type is Baker's sweetened angel flake coconut. I like to buy finely shredded/dessicated coconut because I often bake Australian, British and European style cakes and cookies, which do not work well when made with flake coconut. I have also discovered that finely shredded coconut can be used to make your own coconut milk or coconut cream at home. Flake coconut and dessicated coconut have a different taste and texture. A cup of sweetened angel flake coconut has about 2 tablespoons of sugar added to it, so it is very sweet compared to shredded/dessicated coconut, which has no added sugar at all. The shredded/dessicated coconut is drier and the pieces are very small compared to the flakes, so it has more surface area. Because of these two things, 8oz of dessicated coconut will absorb more liquid than 8oz of flake coconut. Some recipes will work quite well with either kind of coconut, but others will not, even if you compensate for the sugar and liquid. Its better, especially for baking, to use whatever the recipe originally calls for. The coconut I received from Superstore tasted very fresh and had a good use by date. If you want to increase the shelf life of the coconut, throw the bags into the freezer or the refrigerator. They will keep there a year. Once a bag is opened, I always keep it in the refrigerator. I don't like buying this kind of coconut from health food stores, as it often comes in bulk bins and has been exposed to the air. Unsweetened organic coconut can get stale or even develop a rancid taste if it is stored open to the air. The sweetened flake coconut is much more stable because it contains preservatives and sugar. If you are an Australian wanting to make things like lamingtons or coconut ice, you need to use dessicated/finely shredded cooconut. Flake coconut will not give the right results. Dessicated/finely shredded coconut is also excellent for replicating those little coconut macaroon cookies that you find in many Chinese buffet restaurants. Shredded/dessicated coconut can be mixed with water to make your own coconut milk or coconut cream. I find this is useful because I rarely use more than 1/2 a can when I cook with coconut milk (curries, soups, laksa etc). Sometimes I only want a spoonful or two, to add a little flavor to a smoothie or a banana cake. I have tried making coconut milk from flake coconut, but for my taste, it was way too sweet and did not have a good texture. To make coconut milk from dessicated coconut: Method 1. Put equal parts of coconut and hot water by weight into a blender (eg 8oz coconut to 1 cup of hot water). Whizz in the blender for a minute or two. If desired, you can strain and press it through a cloth or a fine sieve when it has cooled down. This is not necessary for most recipes, unless you require a silky smooth texture for the end product. For a lighter coconut milk, use 8oz of coconut to one and a half cups of water, or you can use ""lite"" shredded coconut to start with. Method 2. Simmer equal parts by weight of coconut with hot water until froth appears. Do not boil. Remove from heat and let it sit until it cools down. If desired, you can strain it through a cloth bag or a very fine sieve, pressing out as much liquid as possible. To make a thick coconut cream from dessicated coconut: Use either method above, but use 4 parts of coconut to one part of water. I thought the price from Superstore was excellent, especially for an organic product. At the time of purchase, it worked out at one dollar forty two cents per 8oz bag and in my case, shipping was free. I can't find organic dessicated coconut anywhere else at this price. Overall I was very pleased with the taste, freshness, price and quality of this coconut. I don't think that I will have any problems using up the 12 packets in one year, especially as I won't be buying any cans of coconut milk. …",199 out of 200 users found this review helpful

 Very Disappointed,1,"After having the privilege to test Emerald's Marcona Almonds, I was very much looking forward to testing their Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews. In fact, when the box came in the mail, I raced to open it so I could try out these little gems. Unfortunately, what I expected to be a favorable experience turned out to be terrible. My first taste of these nuts was like having orange pith (the white part between the peel and the orange) fried in oil, doused in a vat of salt and sugar and dipped in black pepper. There is virtually no cashew flavor left in these little nuts. I love cashews. I have eaten them raw and roasted in many ways for years. This experience with Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews was an assault on my taste buds. The salt with citric acid combination is terrible. When you combine it with the maltodextrin AND sugar, the cashew flavor is corrupted beyond recognition. Then adding the black pepper makes it even worse. A handful of these *nuts* is like dumping a salt shaker in your mouth. It is almost repulsive. The nuts themselves are pretty greasy as well. I am very sorry that these cashews were treated this way. I would have preferred the graceful simplicity of simple roasted cashews with a DUSTING of sea salt and black pepper over them- nothing more. The sugar and maltodextrin ruin this mix- and the addition of citric acid makes the finish quite bitter. I do not like these at all. If you love sweet things and don't mind bitterness and a mouth full of salt, you might enjoy these. However, if you love cashews and prefer the seasonings to COMPLIMENT them instead of overpower them, pass on these. …",14 out of 19 users found this review helpful
" Nice bag, but...",2,"The hemp bag is well constructed and easy to use. The problem I had was that my sprouts (Mung Bean) stayed incredibly small. I am sprouting beans from the same batch in a mason jar and by day two, their size is more than twice that of day seven in the bag. Both batches were rinsed on the same schedule. The jar is harder to drain, but given the difference in the end product, I think it is worth the extra work.

 Food Should Taste Good ....,5,"... and these do!! Wow! I was really surprised at how good these chips are. These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there. The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right. They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips. Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt. Not these. An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium. For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts. Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack. Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges? These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers. Yum!! I'll definitely be purchasing these from Superstore -- I've never seen them in the stores, and I simply must have more of them! …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWERS YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA,5,"IN A NUTSHELL: VERY GOOD TASTING ""REAL BREWER'S YEAST"" -- NOTHING ADDED This ""Genuine Brewer's Yeast"" powder tastes very good for real Brewers Yeast. Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.

 Still Amazing!!!,5,"I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet. The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch. With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now. My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you. Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that. I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra. It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge. Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me. And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant. ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!! Cheers!!!! P.S. ZICO is still amazing. …",13 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 T O O......C H U N K Y......A N D.....C R U N C H Y,3,"I had not realized until just now that these FERRERO ROCHER HAZELNUT CHOCOLATES 48 COUNT GIFT BOX, were made by the SAME Ferrero Company that makes ""Nutella"" Hazelnut-Chocolate spread, (which I totally love to eat!) I had some of these individual chocolates once, and did NOT like them! Those who share my taste in chocolates will not like them either! For these Ferraro Rochet Hazelenut Choclolates, have bits of hazel nuts, (finely chopped...but NOT finely chopped enough for me), embedded in a chocolate coating, the whole surrounding a whole hazelnut. I'm one of those people who likes FILETS....boneless fish filets, boneless chicken filets, etc. I, (and I know I'm NOT alone here), like my chocolate mixtures to be complete MIXTURES....like Nutella spread, (or ""figaro"" hazelnut chocolate pieces...also called ""chocolate truffles""). Biting through hard, embedded ""pieces"" of things -- even such tiny pieces of hazelnut as the chocolate-hazelnut coating has here -- is NOT for me, or others like me. In this, I have discovered, I, (or make that, ""we""), have true ""preppy"" tastes, (even though I did attend plain old Queens College in NYC -- part of the very public City University of New York where, it seems, (to me, at least), egalitarian has gone from good to exremes -- and even fraternities and sororities are officially outlawed! To some, this may seem only ""fair"" and ""equitable"". But to status-seeking me, it seems SO unglamourous! I guess I'm not the typical Queens College of the City University of New York student, though I do sincerely laud them for making eduction more available for everyone. I only wish they had more of what private universities have. To me, ""equality"" is equal luxuries for all, not equal utilitarianism for all. Same goal, different methods, I guess....) In ""The Official Preppy Handbook"", it states that preppies like filets...no bones to slice through, or fat to trim away. (Why waste the time, why spend the effort?) The same has to go, (at least for me --and others with ""preppy"" tastes), for these otherwise ""gourmet"" quality confections. Those little bits of chopped hazelnuts in the coating -- not to mention the BIG hazelnut in the centre -- make eating DIFFICULT, and spoil the pleasure of eating. Rather than have a (fancy) chocolate that I must chew through, I would prefer a plain old Hershey choclate bar. It, like the more expensive Nutella, IS a chocolate ""filet"". I suppose this liking of the ""ordinary"" Hershey bar, (and a plain one please -- not one with almonds), proves I am NOT a snob -- I, (and others like me), simply have TASTE! I thought I was alone in this. But since reading ""The Official Preppy Handbook"", I know that others -- far richer than myself -- also have these tastes. This, of course, vindicates me, and I feel glad of it. Enjoy ""Ferrero Rocher Hazelnut Chocolates 48 Count Gift Box"" if you wish...and give it to friends, if that is your desire. But this sort of chocolate, because of the way it is formed, is NOT my choice for either myself or my friends.

 Beautiful and functional,5,"I actually don't even own a peppergrinder because I found that my marble mortar and pestle worked better. When I want pepper, I pour a few of the corns into the mortar. A careful push of the pestle gives me coarse pepper. Mulling the pestle around gives me finely ground, and the aroma is amazing. I use it for all kinds of herbs. I like a second mortar set because if you make pounded garlic or herb butter, it flavors the somewhat porous stone.

 An Excellent Coconut Beverage!,5,"I love coconut water and juice beverages, and I've tried the majority of coconut water/juice brands out there ranging from Zico, Vita Coco, O.N.E., Harvest Bay, C20, Naked, etc. I've tried coconut juices/waters when I traveled to places such as Hawaii, South America, and Thailand. I've actually also drank straight up from real coconuts while I was in Hawaii, South America, and Thailand as well. In my humble opinion, the country that produces and makes the best coconut water and juices is Thailand. Maybe I'm a little biased because I'm Thai American, and the majority of my relatives live in Thailand. But I've traveled to Thailand many times in my life and drank coconut water and juice beverages several times while in Thailand. The Thai-based brands that Superstore currently sell are: Amy and Brian, Taste Nirvana, Nature Factor, Foco, and Chaokoh. And of course, as a Thai American, I've drank from all these Thai-based brands as well. They're all pretty good - Amy and Brian, Foco, and Chaokoh have been around for a long while when it comes to coconut drinks. Foco is a Thai-based company that make many Thai exotic drinks including dragonfruit, basil seed, mangosteen, chrysanthemum, lychee, and even pennywort. I've tried many Foco drinks over the years, and even had their canned pennywort drink in February of this year at Ha Long Bay restaurant in St. Petersburg, Florida (By the way, that Ha Long Bay restaurant has an excellent variety of delicious Boba Teas. I love Boba Teas! The best use of boba pearls I've ever seen was when my sister and I visited a Yogurtology store in St. Petersburg, Florida in early June. You get your choice of frozen yogurts self-serve style, and then you put whatever toppings you want. They had different flavored boba pearls to choose from besides fresh fruit and other dessert toppings. My sister and I thought that was a great idea, putting boba pearls on top of frozen yogurt. Yogurtology is a new chain of stores based in two states so far, Arizona and Florida, and it's such a great place, that they should have this chain nationwide!) and it was the most unusual drink I've ever had so far in my life. It tasted different and unique at first, but I read on the Internet that Pennywort/Gotu Kola is supposed to be good for your body helping strengthen your immune system, reduce arthritis, and helping alleviate other health-related issues. There's even a blog on the website, Too Many Chefs, and people have been exchanging, over several years, their opinions on what they thought about Foco's Pennywort drink. I never read that blog until after I drank the Pennywort drink in February. The reason why I chose that drink is because the name caught my attention at Ha Long Bay restaurant's menu, and I'm often the curious type who always tries my best to try something new at least once. It's kind of amusing to read people's opinions on that Pennywort drink. Chaokoh, besides their coconut drink, make the best coconut milk to cook Asian and Thai meals at home. My family uses Chaokoh coconut milk all the time to cook Thai meals, and Chaokoh also sell a lot of canned Asian/Thai items such as: rambutan, longan, bamboo shoots, sugar cane, banana blossom, and jackfruit. Taste Nirvana, of course, is known for all their coconut beverages and their Thai teas and coffees. They also sell Thai chili sauce as well. And finally, Amy and Brian are known for their excellent coconut juice beverages. Amy and Brian also sell an amazing line of mangosteen juice beverages. In the end, when it comes to the best tasting Thai coconut beverages, Amy and Brian and Taste Nirvana are tied for number one. (In fact, Thai coconut water is so good that even my favorite tea company, Harney and Sons Fine Teas, currently sell Taste Nirvana products directly from their website. They admit that they love Thai coconut water and beverages. Click on Harney and Sons' bottled beverages link on their website and you will see what I mean, and Taste Nirvana is not their own brand or product! Now that's a true testament to how excellent Thai coconut water is! I'm being really truthful when I say that you haven't really tasted good coconut water or juice if you haven't tried Amy and Brian or Taste Nirvana! I've been drinking Amy and Brian's coconut juices (with and without pulp) for many years now, and the majority of coconut waters out there don't measure up to this brand (or Taste Nirvana). You truly get your money's worth when you buy Amy and Brian's drinks. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Be careful with wheat gluten,1,"I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used. The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs. When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract. This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines. This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating. Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off. The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal. So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat. It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains. Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies. …",24 out of 47 users found this review helpful

 Great for cheesemaking and daily use,5,"I bought this milk for making mozzarella, ricotta, and paneer cheese (which it does very well) and have ended up using it for everything. I mix up a quart at a time in a blender for daily drinking and add a tablespoon or two of heavy cream. A hint for mixing: put 1/2 the water in the blender, add the milk powder and pulse blend a few times before adding the remaining water. Once blended, it can be very foamy. Stir cream in with a spoon and allow to sit in the fridge for a day before decanting into a glass bottle. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Terrible customer service,1,"I purchased this through Superstore and it was shipped from Starbucks . I received the order promptly, however when I opened the shipping box, I found the product box with a round blue sticker over the broken seal that keep the product box sealed. Inside, there was coffee grounds all over the box and stuck to all the packets was this gritty stuff. There were 2 sleeves of VIA that were obviously opened and causing the mess in the box. Each of these packets also had a blue sticker! So it was pretty obvious that I was shipped a known defective product. When I called Starbucks, at first they wouldn't help me and treated me like they didn't ship this item (because I ordered thru Superstore) and would not replace this product. They said I would have to pay to ship it back to them and they would send a refund. I didn't want a refund, I just wanted the product replaced. They said that after I returned it, I would have to completely reorder and pay for the product. I called the customer service again and got the run-around. There customer service is awful. I guess they figure they can afford to lose a customer if they behave this way. That is why I am posting this review.... I would not recommend buying from Starbucks. …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Real Quality Nutrition,5,"I got this for my long hair male cat who has been prescribed wet food by the vet after having urinary tract problems. I read about Weruva and that the Paw Lickin' Chicken would be good for him and keep his urine pH at levels to prevent struvite crystals, just like the vet prescribed food. The Paw Lickin' Chicken has a lot of water and low magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium. But unlike the veterinarian recommended food, it has no byproducts or fillers or grains. Weruva actually looks like food, not gruel, and it doesn't have an unpleasant smell like a lot of cat foods. Weruva costs almost as much as the vet prescribed brand, but Weruva is clearly made with superior ingredients. I will still be monitoring my cat for any problems, but so far this food is working fine for him and I feel better knowing he is on a better quality food. At first my cat was hesitant to eat the Weruva food, but I believe that was simply because he wasn't used to the texture. The Weruva chicken is shredded into fine strips, rather than minced. My cat would drink the juices, as he had no problem with the flavor, but was reluctant to actually eat the chicken. So I had to mix it with the prescription food he had been eating before he would eat the Weruva food by itself. It is a good idea to mix the food with what your cat has been eating, anyway, so they can gradually get used to it. Now my cat doesn't hesitate and will eagerly eat the Weruva food. …",47 out of 50 users found this review helpful
 Excellent whole grain,5,"This is a superbly nutritious grain that is also easy to fix. Because it has already been rinsed, one can use it without rinsing off the hulls.

It's easy to work with, has a great consistency and has a great taste. I highly recommend this product.

 Not what the picture describes,2,"I bought this steak for my father in law for Christmas because he had always wanted to try Omaha Steaks, and I heard good things about it. I purchased the private reserve because it is a higher quality of meat than the regular cuts and wanted to get him something extra special, but was I in for a surprise. I should have stuck with the cheaper meat. The meat came with extremely large amounts of fat all around. We had cut off a significant amount of fat prior to cooking,and the steak was still fatty once it was cooked. I was very dissapointed and so was he. We were going to call Omaha Steaks to complain, will never buy this brand again. Very unhappy with it. The taste wasn't even something that was worth raving about either.

 A Very Good Snack Chip,4,"Flavor is good, not excellent. I really like these but I have to stay accurate here with the review. They are very good but not the best. I guess there are some limits you get from staying healthy. As a health snack I'd give them 5 stars though. Secondly, they leave almost no oil residue in your mouth. So you don't have to wash them down with any strong soda to cut the film off of your tongue. And let's face it, a healthy snack is not healthy if you have to use some unhealthy drink to wash it down. All in all, these are one of my favorite healthy snacks. Very good. …",17 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 watch out for ethoxyquine,1,"The high amount of fish meal in this food probably contains ethoxyquine which is a carcinogenic preservative. It accumulates in the liver and causes damage down the road. Unless you can get written verification that this company buys fish meal that does not contain ethoxyquine, do not feed this food. I think it states on the bag that no artificial preservatives are ""added"". This just means that Solid Gold company did not add artificial preservatives in their formulation (dog food companies are not required to list ingredients which were already present in the meals that they purchased). Fish meal in dry dog food is the newest fad since it is now recognized that dogs need essential omega 3 fatty acids. Unfortunately, these fatty acids have a very short shelf life (a week maybe?)and so dry dog food is not a reliable supply for these fats. Adding large amounts of a very strong anti-oxidant (ethoxyquine, which was developed as a pesticide and later found to be excellent for preventing the oxidation of latex rubber)is the only way to keep fish dregs (i.e. ""fish meal"")from becoming overly putrid. If you don't have a good preservative, then your dog ends up eating rancid fats which are also toxic. Solution: feed a natural diet of real food. If you still want to feed kibble, buy one that does not contain ethoxyquine and fish meal, then supplement your dog with human grade fish oil capsules. Also, don't fall for the flaxseed gimmick either. The short chain omega 3 fatty acids in flaxseed are not converted to the essential long chain fatty acids that high food chain mammals need. Dogs do not have the enzyme to make the conversion (ruminants do and so do krill!) …",11 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 OVERPRICED and OVERRATED!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!,1,"This salt is only $22.95 from the manufacturer's website, celticseasalt . c o m , further more this website and this manufacturer is highly deceptive, and it is obvious by the comments on this website. all modern sea salt has significantly less trace minerals than ancient himalayan sea salt. the manufacturer provides a graph that seems to indicate this salt has more than 3 times the trace minerals, when all they are really comparing is the moisture content. you are paying for about 12% water when you buy this product by weight, which is about 3 times the amount of water in himalayan salt. himalayan salt forms an alkaline solution in water, due to its higher trace mineral content, while all modern sea salt forms acidic solutions. this salt does have a decent flavor, which i find goes well with fish, but for all other cooking, himalayan salt is both tastier and healthier. a lot of reviewers have been duped by the spurious and misleading information on the manufacturers website. this salt has a significantly lower ratio of trace minerals to sodium than himalayan salt. …",19 out of 28 users found this review helpful
 Not what I hoped for,2,"I make a lot of soups and also often use chicken bullion when I make beans or sauces. After getting disgusted with not being able to find one without ""Salt, MSG..."" as the first two ingredients on the label I turned to Superstore and found this. After receiving it today and making a sample cup of broth I have to say I'm really disappointed in it. First of all, there's no ""chicken"" in the ingredients at all. The closest we have to anything animal is ""CSC shortening"" -- I don't know what that particular product is but much of the time shortenings are trans-fats which are extremely unhealthy for you. The last ingredient listed is ""Other Spices"" which is often a codeword for MSG. Basically, as far as I can tell from the product list and taste of the final product this is a jar full of tumeric and celery and onion powder. When you use it to make broth you end up with a substance that's the same color, opacity, and viscosity as orange juice and that tastes not at all of chicken broth. It also has a film of semisolid granules floating at the top that have the consistency of those little orange fish eggs you sometimes find on sushi (my guess is that it's either the shortening or poorly dissolved celery powder) that would have to be skimmed off of any soup you made if you wanted people to actually eat it. The next two products I will try in my search for a low/no sodium chicken base is Herb Ox's Sodium Free Chicken Bullion (which potassium cholride as a substitute for salt and monoammonium glutamate as a sub for MSG, an imperfect solution to just leaving them out) and if that doesn't taste good then I'll probably end up with the ""low"" sodium Better Than Bullion chicken stock paste product, which I know at least tastes right even though it still has an awful lot of salt in there and is much more expensive than regular bullion. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

" too easy, even for ""not-so-smart"" dogs",2,"i called up Kyjen customer service for a recommendation on a puzzle toy, and *bonus* got a iive person on the phone (brownie points for great service). I have a mini dachshund, who, although adorable, is not so bright and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item, my dachshund figured it out within minutes---i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly! Unfortunately, I wanted this toy to last for a while but this one unfortunately is too easy. See, If you spin the star just 20 degrees, *all* the treat trays are exposed, and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dogs playtime and challenge them further.

 Great Bold Smooth Kup of Coffee,5,"This is Green Mountain's response to the Coffee People's Donut Shop coffee. Many people actually confuse the two which isn't difficult to do: donut house and donut shop -- both are extra bold in flavor, and both are excellent. Since Donut Shop is my favorite, I decided to conduct a taste test between these two rivals. Side to side they are very similar, very little acid taste, no bitterness which is what I look for in an extra bold roast. Head to head Donut Shop edged this coffee, Donut House, out by the slightest of margin. Donut Shop had slightly more body to it but frankly, it took me drinking a half cup of each before I could declare a winner. This is why I also think this is a 5 star coffee -- excellent choice if you want a simple, great tasting cup of coffee that you will not get sick of. …",42 out of 42 users found this review helpful

 Content means less than names,2,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed. Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food. Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm? …",6 out of 49 users found this review helpful

" Flavor okay, not great",4,"I struggled with rating this bar a 3 or a 4. Taste is only about a 3, but quality of ingredients in providing a healthy and edible alternative to a candy bar rates it a solid 4. Below is the gist a a review I wrote for Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Cherry Pie comparing it with the PURE Wild Blueberry Bar. When I was searching for a healthier between meal afternoon snack I read a lot of reviews for a lot of products. I wanted something with few ingredients, not ""fortified"" and with some nuts in it. I settled on the Larabar Fruit & Nut Cherry Pie bars and the PURE Bar Organic Wild Blueberry Living Food Bar. I love cherries and I love blueberries so they seemed like good choices. The stats of the bars are very similar, weight (both 1.7oz, not 1.8), calories, fat, sugars, etc. The PURE has more protein at 6g vs 4g. The Larabar has no sodium while the PURE has just a bit at 5mg. The Larabar is thicker, the PURE bar is wider. Visually the Larabar appears to have more nuts in it, which doesn't seem to jive with the protein stats. The PURE bar has a grittier texture while chewing so maybe more of the nuts are finely ground. 1st ingredient is dates for both followed by almonds and then cherries for the Larabar and followed by blueberries and various nuts, organic agave nectar, rice protein and lemon juice for the PURE bar. One would think with the extra ingredients in the PURE bar they were added to tweak the flavor or give it a fresher taste, but the flavor of the Larabar is better than the PURE by a pretty good margin. It has a much fresher and lively taste. I have to say the PURE bar is a bit cardboardy tasting to me and has a drier mouth feel. It is not bad, in fact my 2 youngest kids eat them readily, just not nearly as good as the Larabar. I think the tartness of the cherries in the Larabar kick up the flavor vs the milder blueberry flavor of the PURE (maybe the lemon juice add as an attempt to kick up the PURE bar flavor and tartness?). In fairness I should probably review the PURE Cherry Cashew bar but I much prefer almonds over cashews so don't plan on ordering any from Superstore. If I stumble on the PURE cherry in a regular store I will give one a try though. I still get both auto shipped from Superstore for variety sake, but am looking for a better tasting blueberry bar w/ basic ingredients including nuts. For grins here is a comparison of the Larabar, PURE, Snickers, Hershey's and Maruchan Chicken Ramen noodles in a few categories. Stats are listed in the order I listed them in the previous sentence. Calories: 190, 190, 280, 210, 380 Total Fat: 8g, 9, 14, 13, 14 Saturated Fat: 0.5g, 1, 5, 8, 7 Sugars: 21g, 20, 30, 24, 0 Protein: 4g, 6, 4, 3, 10 Sodium: 0mg, 5, 140, 35, 1540 !!! UPDATE Nov 11, 2009 PURE has changed this bar. I got my regular shipment and noticed the bars came in a newly shaped box and new packaging. Total fat went from 9g to 8g and they eliminated all sodium. Total carbs edged up to 26g from 25g. Protein remains 6g and calories at 190. The BIG CHANGE is that ""Organic Wild Blueberries"" drops from the 2nd item listed on the ingredients list to the 5th! Blueberries are now after not only dates but walnuts, cashews and rice proein concentrate. Bumping up the nut content would not be a bad thing, but since the total fat actually decreased and carbs increased, I think the nut quantity actually decreased along with the blueberries, but the date quantity increased. This seems to basically be a date bar w/ nuts now and some minor blueberry content. I'd love to see the actually quantity of blueberries in this bar. Ironically, I can actually see blueberries scattered in the new bar, whereas the old bar was more of a dense blended mush. The bar is noticeably lighter in color now (and density)...more tan than blue. The new packaging implies a longer slimmer bar shape, but oddly the actual bar is shorter, wider and a tad thicker...package marketing? The total weight is unchanged at 1.7oz. I'm still looking for an alternative blueberry bar...I imagine cost is a big factor in blueberry content. My 2 kids will still eat these but they noticed the change right away and are not impressed. …",97 out of 105 users found this review helpful

Seventeen baby formulas were tested in the Darmouth College study. According to the Today show, ""Two of the infant formulas contained organic brown rice syrup as their primary ingredient. These products had arsenic levels 20 to 30 times that of the other infant formulas.. The amount of arsenic consumed by an infant could be significant depending on which formula they drank.. arsenic exposure early in life may increase the risk for health problems later on."" The study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives, indicates that organic infant milk formula containing OBRS as the primary ingredient had total concentrations up to six times the EPA safe drinking water limit. The formulas tested were not named but a quick search turned up that Baby's Only organic toddler formula - both dairy and soy - uses brown rice syrup as its main source of carbohydrate.

There are lots of good reviews on this product already and I agree with all of them... this stuff is HOT but also TASTY. I ALWAYS have a bottle of this on hand. My latest favorite thing to do with this sauce is to mix it with an equal part of Frank's Red Hot and a splash of vinegar and use it to drown a plateful of pelmehni (Russian dumplings). That mixture, by the way, is also fantastic on wings. On it's own, Rooster sauce is a MUST for me in ANY curry... it adds heat and complements the flavor perfectly and I also love to drizzle a bit (just a bit) into my chicken soup (not weird....I used to dump truckloads of Rooster into my Udon noodle soup!). Really, the uses for the Rooster are endless.... but if you regularly cook things like stir fry or curry (any style) and you like a bit of kick.. this is a MUST HAVE pantry staple. Plus, it's fun to dare people to eat spoonfuls of it. :) I'm hungry. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 My favorite of all potato chips,5,"First, I wouldn't trust anybody's opinion on a food item because everyone has different tastes. Secondly, these chips are awesome and you should buy them because I say so. Okay, well, actually, I suggest you go buy one bag somewhere prior to buying a dozen bags and finding out you don't like them. I do love these chips though. Most Vinegar/Salt chips are too wangy or tart for me. These chips have a mildly tart, slightly sweet vinegar flavor. Also I am a salt-aholic and these chips satisfy my salt cravings perfectly. Texture is similar to other kettle type chips - plenty crunchy. Totally yummy! I'm salivating just thinking of them. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Yummy,5,"Despite what some think there is a ton of fillers in here (see the ingredient list on the Omaha site), but.... that is not a bad thing in this case.

 Super seasoning for plenty of different foods.,5,"Don't be fooled by the simple packaging of this mixed spice. This is not a simple flavor. If you like the steaks served at a certain ""Australian"" styled steak house you may well like this seasoning. A friend of mine introduced it to me at a little cook out, where he rubbed a generous amount on some new york strip cuts and grilled, and I fell in love. He then told me that this was the above mentioned steak house's secret seasoning for it's steaks, him claiming to know this by having worked their for a time. I know he had worked at just about every chain restaurant at some point, but that's about all I can confirm in regards to this rumor one way or the other as I've never had a steak there, nor worked at one. Regardless of the truthfullness of that statement, I can firmly attest to fact that this is an excellent mixed spice. I've used it on just about every type of meat except sea food, though I suspect it would be good on that too, with a noteable preformance on eggs. It is mildly spicey and fairly salty, but not overpowering unless you really load up. Reminds me of cajun seasonings in simular packaging, but is not as ""hot"". I highly recommend a good cut of beef, pan fried in olive oil with a generous amount of Cavender's Greek Seasoning rubbed in. It is also priced very well, and one container is more then enough to last a while. If you for some reason don't love it, you won't be out very much money and if you end up loving it as much as I do, you'll have plenty of it to last you a long time. A seasoning every kitchen should have! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Perfect for a home theatre popper,5,"I love this popcorn, and with the subscription savings of 15% and free shipping that you get on subscription products, this stuff is a bargain. I used to use th 4oz kits with my Whirley Pop and it made delicious popcorn every time. I moved to the 8oz bags when my Matinee Movie 8oz popper arrived from Discount Tommy. The 8oz bags have nearly twice the yield of the 4 oz kits and are less than 4 dollars a case more (Thats only .16 more a kit for double the batch) My 8oz popper creates a little more old maids because the kettle is designed to spit out the corn on the bottom of the tray as it pops. The 8oz kit is a bit big for home use unless you actually have a commercial style popper. There are very few oil based poppers (electric or stove) that can handle the yield of these kits, and if you have a Whirly Pop or Stir Crazy then I would get the 4oz kits. If you have a commercial style 8oz popper I would totally recommend these. The funny thing is that the 4oz kits have instructions for hot air machines. They say just don't use the oil. Are you kidding me!?!? It's the coconut oil and the butter salt that give this stuff it's ""movie theatre"" taste. Buying this stuff for a hot air machine is just plain dumb. Well, using a hot air machine for popcorn is just plain dumb, but that's just my opinion.... ;-) …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful

" For those who like savory flavors, a real treat on toast",5,"This tiny jar of concentrated yeast extract is quite the breakfast food. To use Marmite, spread it thinly on toast or sandwich bread. Wait! What do you mean by ""thinly?"" I mean, practically thin enough to be a monolayer of molecules, because if you spread it any thicker, it will taste pretty strong. Well, actually, I use a quarter of a teaspoon on each piece of toast, which is buttered first to lubricate the process. And wait, how would one spread it thinly on fresh, untoasted AMERICAN bread without it tearing the fluffy crumb into tiny **** only suitable for feeding the koi? Again, a bit of softened butter, then a schmear of Marmite, a slice of tomato and you have a super tea sandwich. This is often my dinner, when I want something light. How and why was Marmite invented, and how did it become a beloved British traditional food, right up there with hedgehog-flavoured potato crisps? Back in 1902, some genius took the lees of good old British Ale, that is to say, Brewer's Yeast, and boiled it down to a tarry, black substance that no one in their right mind would eat unless their Mum forced them to. Because of the B-complex, Marmite became popular as a supplement for prisoners-of-war, served in hospitals, schools, to troops in WWI and WWII. It almost was rationed in WWII, with mothers told to spread it ""very thinly, for now."" Traditionally, Marmite is served on sandwiches and especially on toast at breakfast on toast ""soldiers"" or triangles of toast that kids can dip into their boiled eggs. The flavor is meaty, salty, though it has less salt than the butter you might use with it, and it has no meat or animal product--it's made of yeast so is vegetarian-vegan. The flavor, frankly, takes some getting used to if you don't like strong, savory things. However, if you like savory, meaty flavors and want something non-sugary sweet on your breakfast toast, Marmite is fantastic. The closest I can describe the flavor is on the order of soy sauce, beef bouillion or mushroom pate. Other uses for Marmite are to flavor soups, meat or vegetable loaves, and stews, as a mix in dips or on bread for sandwiches and canapes. 4 grams or about 1/8 ounce of Marmite has the following B vitamins: Riboflavin 0.28mg (17.5% RDA) Niacin 5.4mg (35.6% RDA) Folic Acid 100ug (50.0% RDA) Vitamin B12 0.5ug (60.0% RDA) …",100 out of 102 users found this review helpful

 Shows no Trans Fats but there are... watch out!,1,"I wouldn't feed this to a pet. Though the nutritional info shows '0 Trans Fats' the ingredients list shows ""Partially Hydrogenated"" oils... that is Trans Fats. Basically, natural oils that have been modified by attaching two hydrogen molecules where they don't occur in nature. The end result... the oil is solid a room temperature and creates a crispier product. The impact to your health is that your system thinks it is oil (fat) and lets it into your blood stream where it is handled like a plastic. You system doesn't know what to do with it and it is plastered on the walls of your arteries where it stays for a long long time. Folks... if you care about Type 2 diabetes, cholesterol problems, altheimers disease... maybe more. Keep these Trans Fats away from yourself and loved ones.

We have tried double brewing at least 5 other varieties of tea, but they don't hold up- they come out flavorless and watery.

 Confident giving this to my dog,5,"After careful research on the best dry food for my dog's diet, I chose Wellness Core Reduced Fat. My mixed breed dog is low energy and has a tendency to put weight on easily. It was very difficult to find a dog food that does not compromise quality ingredients to make a food low fat. Since my dog is low energy (by no means a sled dog), her diet does not require her to have extreme protein intake. This food is the prefect balance of protein, quality meat sources, fat content, as well as important sources of fruits and vegetables and fish oils. Her eyes are bright and coat is shiny. While she hasn't lost any weight, she hasn't gained any either, which is a good thing! You get what you pay for when it comes to dog food. When purchasing this brand, one is paying for high quality food (meat content, veggies, fruits) without fillers or extreme levels of protein.

" Love the coffee,  but hate the incorrect packaging description",4,"I've ordered Baronet's Dark Kenya AA pods several times now, and just love the deep, rich cup of joe that my Senseo can extract from these. No complaints about the pods and their use with my machine. However... When I saw that the pods were now being offered in these smaller pouches instead of the wastefully overpackaged boxes, I was intrigued. My typical concern with these pouches is that if each pod typically isn't individually wrapped, they can grow stale if I don't move through them quickly enough. Since I saw in multiple places in the product description that these were still individually wrapped, I decided to check it out. Sadly, I must report that the staff at Superstore goofed on this product description big time. These pouches contain 18 loose pods that are not individually wrapped. While I love this coffee, I'll be switching back to the other packaging after I drink these up. Baronet, please don't get rid of the individually wrapped pods. In fact, it would be great if Superstore offered individually wrapped pods in bulk much like the 100% Arabica Coffee Pods, Box of 150 espresso pods. == UPDATE == Here's another buyer beware note: although these are still packed 18 to a package, each pod has been downsized by 25%! With the Coffee Dark Roast Kenya AA Coffee Pods, 18-Count Box (Pack of 3) , each pod is a nice and rotund 10 grams; this product shrinks each to a skimpy 7.5 grams (yet each of smaller pods in less packaging are less the two cents cheaper than the bigger ones. As such, each smaller pod isn't producing nearly as robust a mug (double-cup) of coffee as the other version of Baronet's Dark Roast Kenya AA pods.

 Prowl Cat Food - How to Introduce It To Your Cat for the First Time,5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 4:29 Mins </span>VIDEO REVIEW: In the video, I show how I mix up Prowl, what it looks like, plus my three cats are shown eating it. Her Highness Serena, Oliver the Tabby Kitten and my Siamese the Wonder Kitty say, ""Purrlease enjoy the video!"" :) My kitten Oliver gets a small amount of Prowl because he is on another food currently and will be transitioning to Prowl shortly. Enjoy the video! :) My (written) review: ;) Basically, this is to help anyone introducing Prowl to your cats for the first time. Once your kitties get used to Prowl, you can mix it up to different consistencies. :) I received a sample in the mail from Prowl before purchasing my first box of Prowl. This sample turned out to be very helpful, as the sample was for making one portion of cat food. The sample was ""1 ounce"" or ""29 grams"" to be mixed with ""1/4 cup water."" All three of my cats -- my 12-year-old Domestic Shorthair, my two-year-old finicky eater Siamese, and my six-month-old golden tabby, loved it. Then I bought a two-pound box. The directions say to mix 1/4 cup warm water with 1/4 cup Prowl. Imagine my surprise when I weighed 1/4 cup of Prowl with a food scale and discovered that it only weighs 23 grams and, when mixed with 1/4 cup of water, makes a very watery soup that my cats turned up their noses at in disgust. Thankfully, I had kept the empty sample packet as a reference. I measured 29 grams of Prowl on the food scale, the same amount that was in the Prowl sample packet. To that I added 1/4 cup water. This time, the consistency came out perfectly, and my cats loved it. The ""Happy Cat"" ratio is: 1/4 cup Prowl (Sample Packet Prowl) i.e. 29 grams of Prowl to 1/4 cup water, and one way is with a food scale. Or you can mix your Prowl up a bit thicker and that will work just fine, too. What my cats taught me is there is quite a difference in Sample Packet Prowl (29 grams) and the 1/4 cup ""Directions On The Box"" (23 grams). NOTE: The video mentions food scales, but you can just add extra Prowl if you don't have a food scale. :) My cats find this food very tasty (as you can see for yourselves in the video!) Enjoy your healthier cat! My cats are reaping the benefits and I can't say enough about this food: less shedding, less allergies, and my cats' overall condition. However you get there, I hope you find the purrfect ""Happy Cat"" ratio for your cat on Prowl! ~~ >> There is no snooze button on a cat who wants breakfast. &lt;&lt; …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

A light dribble of oil, with a sliver of goat cheese, and our pasta is complete. Heavenly! This Savini oil has the aroma and the finish of a great flavored oil, with the sophisticated delicacy to warrant the price. Other domestic oils finish so harshly as to be distasteful and disagreeable. Having experienced this oil, we know what good food may be experienced, We discovered this oil upon the learning our previous oil was no longer being imported. It too was wonderful, but our need to have a replacement, a superior truffle oil, sent us searching, and we found this Italian export through Superstore .

 My bassett hound LOVES his food now...,5,"Canidae has definetly proven to be a tasty, balanced source of food for my dog. Initially i had started my new pup on IAMS because of its popularity - but after reading the ingredient list and hearing the the IAMS corporation had just been sold (therefore not keeping the quality of their product) I decided I needed to provide my hound with a heathier source of nutrition. I volunteer at the local Human Society Shelter and a friend of mine there suggested that I try ""Canidae"". At first I was hesitant because of the cost - but when i read the nutrition facts and saw REAL, all natural ingredients, i felt confident enough that the price was worth it. Before i started feeding my bassett Canidae he would only eat once a day (placing a full bowl of food down for him in the early morning on my way to work...he would wait until late at night to eat AFTER I had my dinner and slowly munch on a couple bits here and there). The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food. Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime. Occasionally I will cook up some frozen vegetables with an egg and mix it in his food for a little variety, but I havent had to do that in a while. If you love your dog and care about his/her nutrition, I suggest giving Canidae a try. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
