 Excellent Chips!,5,"These chips are really, really good. I don't bother buying any other kind of potato chips. These have a great taste and no messy greasy fingers. I was shocked and disappointed to find out my local grocery suddenly stopped carrying the chips. Thank goodness for Superstore. Now I can get the chips right to my door--cheaper than I was paying at the grocer! …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",38 out of 40 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Makes Wonderful Soup!,5,"I absolutely love this soup mix! It has become a staple in my diet. It is quite easy to make, and it tastes great. I also love how cheap it is. I use 1 cup of mix per batch, and there are 4 cups (approx) per bag. Each batch gives me 4 large servings. So that means this box gives me 64 servings! At the subscribe and save price that means $0.20 per serving! I dare you to find a meal that fills you up this much, is this good for you, and only costs $0.20!!!! Here's my recipe: 1 cup of the Veggie Soup Mix 6 cups of water 6 TB of Vegetable Broth Powder (you can also use bullion or liquid broth) 1 can of Tomatoes (either diced, stewed or half of each) season with Basil, Oregano, Marjoram, Salt & Pepper to taste Throw all this in a pot and cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

 A really good product,5,"OK, where do I start? Clif Bar is a company located in Berkeley, California, that specializes in foods for people on the go, focusing on environmentally sustainable practices. The ZBaR is made with all-organic non-genetically engineered ingredients with no trans fat, no high-fructose corn syrup. Even the packaging is made with non-toxic inks on foil (not plastic) wrapping, and packed in a recycled cardboard box. So, this is really a good product. It tastes great, chewy and sweet with the firm chocolate chips providing a delicious counterpoint to the whole grain bar. My kids love it, and I feel good about it and the sustainable philosophy of the company. Like I said, a good product - good to eat, good for you, good for the planet.

 D&eacute;licieux !,5,"Just got back from France and didn't see this product when I was in Arles, near the Camargue. Later, in Nice, it was served at a restaurant (Vin Sur Vin -- recommended) with my grilled bass. It added such wonderful flavor to the fish, and to the accompanying vegetables. I had no time to go looking for some there, so I'm thrilled to be able to order it on Superstore. There is a really special taste and texture to it. The container on my table even had the signature of the man who had gathered the crystals. It would make a wonderful gift to dinner hosts. …",33 out of 33 users found this review helpful

 Lo Sodium Sardines,4,"I have been purchasing Reese Skinless & Boneless sardines for several months. These sardines come neatly packed approximately 5 to a can. They have always tasted fresh with no fishy taste. As an added bonus they are low in sodium, only 45mg/can. Most canned sardines are high in sodium. The sardines are good eaten right from the can or in a sandwich with tomatoes or scallions. Sometimes I add a small amount of olive oil as the fish can be a tad dry. Excellent sardines. An additional note: For what it is worth the sardines processed in Portugal are far superior to those processed in Morocco. Those from Morocco have of late been over cooked and bits and pieces while the ones from Portugal are firm whole pieces. …",25 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 OMG It WORKS!,5,"I have been using this product for almost a week now and my only complaint is that I didn't find pit about it sooner! First, a bit about myself. I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess! I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM. Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep! Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too. Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day! I feel so much lighter, my friends and family always said I was full of **** and I guess they were right! I guess after reading my review you are thinking either she is being paid for this or it really works, well it is definitely the latter! It is working for me and I believe it will work for you too, try it what have you got to lose besides a crappy mood, sleepless night, a lot of **** and cramps? Jeez, I think $23.00 is a pretty fair trade off don't you. One more thing the dosage that I am using is two teaspoons at night and one teaspoon in the morning, both with 3 teaspoons of benefiber mixed in girl still needs her fiber! and BTW it's a store brand).

 THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWERS YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA,5,"IN A NUTSHELL: VERY GOOD TASTING ""REAL BREWER'S YEAST"" -- NOTHING ADDED This ""Genuine Brewer's Yeast"" powder tastes very good for real Brewers Yeast. Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.

 Great innovative product,5,"I had heard about this product in a class I had attended and found it at one local grocery store.

 Very very tasty snack,5,"Attracted by the packaging, I purchased a bag [of the Classic Sea Salt flavor] in a local 'gourmet market'. At 110 calories, I suspected that I had been, as frequently happens, fooled by the 'serving size' (you know how it goes, 2.5 pieces = a 'serving' - so there are actually 7 'servings'/bag) BUT, NO, what a pleasant surprise - 110 calories was for the WHOLE delicious bag! They're non-greasy, light as a feather and unexpectedly filling - I almost couldn't finish the bag. I noticed they were produced here in NY, which I also liked and, after going online to find out more about them, decided to splurge for a case [of 1 oz. bags] to try all the varieties. One ounce doesn't sound like very much but they are so light that it is actually a very full bag and definitely more than enough for a single serving. (The 3 oz. bag contains substantially more then you would want for just one person) Favorites so far are: Honey Mustard & Onion Vintage Cheese Classic Sea Salt I don't have kids but I expect these would work extremely well as a lunch box addition. My only suggestion to the company would be that it might be a good idea if they made them available for purchase in smaller quantities. I'm afraid many people will be put off by having to purchase in 12- & 24-bag sized cases. But, if you do decide to purchase, I also have no doubt that you'll have no trouble sharing them with friends and will probably be back for more sooner than you expected. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Great for Skin and Hair,5,"I use this as a hair and scalp oil. It leaves my hair soft and shiny. There's no greasy or residue buildup. It absorbs right into the hair and scalp, If you apply to your hair, wait few minutes and then run your fingers through your hair, there will be no residue on your fingers--none. Your hair will feel soft, supple, and look shiny. A previous reviewer said she uses it on her skin. I do too. I usually put in on my face before bed. Just like she said, it absorbs right into your skin and there is no residue. I started using it because my mom has uses it. But, I never knew much about it. I did an online search to find out more about this oil. According to the information I got, with regular use, Coconut oil can help reverse sun damage and reduce signs of aging on your face and neck. The article also said it helps eliminate ""liver spots"" The reason given was that coconut oil breaks down so fast that it really does absorb into the layers of your skin, instead of just sitting on the surface like so many face creams and lotions do. It is good for the skin. I'm 50, and my skin is holding up pretty well. I have very few ""liver"" spots near my ears, but absolutely none on my forehead and cheeks. A lot of people have a whole face full of them by the time they are my age. It is a healthy oil to consume. It is solid, but it breaks down so easily in the body that the liver(the real organ) doesn't have to even get involved in the breaking down process, like it does with most fats we consume. It's a shame, I always thought this was one of the worst oils you could eat. Turns out, it's one of the best oils to consume. If you do an online search, you can find a lot of information about the many benefits of coconut oil by an MD. You can even find out how it got it's bad reputation, …",78 out of 80 users found this review helpful

 Ekobrew Washer Hack,4,"When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good. I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer. If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past. The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer. The washer I used is rubber, 1/16"" thick, 5/32"" inside diameter, and 3/8"" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493. …",232 out of 235 users found this review helpful

" Dogs love it, but be sure to give in moderation or you'll be sorry!",3,"I bought this with the Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug, since it was recommended that they go together. I have two papillons - one loved the toy and was quite good at getting the treats out of the bottle rather quickly...while the other one waited and consumed what fell out. That being said, they consumed a fair amount of the treats. Not a lot, but a good handful. Since the product was recommended to go with the toy, I had assumed that it would be okay for them to have more than just one or two of these. The next day, when it was Potty Time, I noticed that their #2's were bright green, and a little ""loose"" (sorry for being so graphic). My dogs don't eat table scraps or any people food - I feed them Science Diet puppy bites, with occasional training treats, and this is the first time I've ever noticed a problem with their BMs. They seem to like the taste of these, though they prefer others. I would recommend mixing them with some other treats rather than using them consistently, or you'll be cleaning it up later. I will probably continue mixing these in with other treats/kibble until I use up the bag, but will not purchase anymore in the future. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 WOW - The BEST Honey !!!,5,"Let me just start by saying that I am the kind of gal who cooks for her family and tries very hard to either buy local grown or when those aren't available, organic products. I tried the Really Raw Honey - OH MY GOSH! Hands down - the BEST honey I have ever tasted! When you open the jar, you notice it has a beautiful fragrance! It tastes like honey and flowers - it is so smooth, flavorful, delightful! No preservatives, no heating, no pesticides... Just like if you went out, took a knife and scraped a bee-hive. Soooo GOOOOD! One reviewer had an issue with it not being ""organic"". I would just like to say that the bees are local to where the manufacturer is. They pollinate on flowers that have not been sprayed, harvested.... They are providing as pure and free-from-by-product honey as you can get on the market today. And remember - organic, although better than off the shelf produce/meat/eggs... does not mean free-range, local grown.... That is a whole different topic that I could go on about. A note on the cappings (crust as some put it), that is a very important and enzyme dense feature. It is to be eaten. It is DELICIOUS!!!!! When you take a bite, it is sweet - like the honey, and chewy like a yummy treat. Then after that, it is chewy like gum - which is bits of wax from the honeycomb. This is highly sought after and full of good stuff for your bodies. So, don't throw it away - eat it!

 Should have read the bad review first.,1,"Just back from a trip to Japan, hungry for some good nabeyaki udon, I ordered this stock. There's got to be something better on the market. I love salt, and dashi should be salty, but not overwhelmingly so. And why sugar, let alone two or three types of sugar? While I don't have a problem with MSG myself, I do try to avoid it. Probably my own fault; I should have specified ""No MSG"", except it never occurred to me that a package with this many bad chemicals wouldn't be labelled somewhere! Outside of any of this, the dashi has none of the complexity or subtlety you hope for in a dashi base. I know if I want all of that, I need to make it from scratch, but since purchasing this I've tried several non-MSG brands and all of them are better.

" Poor quality and gritty, Expiration Date Unknown",1,"We received our order form Superstore last week and it came in an unmarked box with 24 counts in it. There's no expiration date whatsoever imprinted inside or outside of the box, nor is it on the packets themselves. We don't know how long it has been sitting in the warehouse. Judging by the texture of the almond butter upon opening, it must have been quite a while. The texture is rather gritty, and very dry. It's almost hardened and cannot be squeezed out whatsoever. We tried to soften the spread by warming it in the boiling water with pouch intact but it had no effect. It was completely solid when we opened each pouch. You can't squeeze it out. It is VERY difficult to open each foil packet without scissors on hand. Very badly made inside out, in short. …",25 out of 33 users found this review helpful
" It's so good, I don't even want to tell you because I'm afraid the price will go up (law of supply and demand)",5,"I'm making myself tell what I would prefer to keep secret: Truly this is the best-quality,genuine article,cold-pressed (in small quantities)olive oil, made right here in the U.S.A. (California). People (including, in the past, myself)don't actually understand that even the olive oils imported from Italy now are sub-standard. Bariani, by contrast, is the nearest to what was consumed by the Greeks and Romans of long ago: simply cold-pressed in small batches, no heat is used, no other oils are used, no other additives are used. I'm not a gourmet, instead I am a fat 51-year-old that tends to veer towards the boxed hamburger meals when desperate! This is not ""snooty gourmets"" liking their incidental odd-tasting items, Bariani Olive Oil is truly and simply a great product and I agree with all the other reviewers: EXCELLENT. By the way, I do know the first clue that you are not buying a true olive oil is when the container is clear: true olive oil cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. Bariani uses a proper, imported, dark-green bottle for their very special product. Even Olive Oil can get complicated: the majority of olive oils, imported and domestic, are heated, not 100% olive oil and taste terrible after tasting Bariani. I also buy through the company website and by phone and these people are so kind and upstanding -- it's family owned and they intend to keep it that way. The only concern I have is the day will come when Bariani may have to increase their prices due to the law of supply and demand...and I would still buy it!

" Bob, could you PLEASE use a FINER grind?????",3,"I have been baking gluten-free on a daily basis for approximately 3 years. Believe me when I say that I have tried just about every brand of Brown Rice Flour there is. Here is the skinny: If you want a very tender, melt in your mouth baked good that is reminiscent of your wheat flour days, use Authentic Foods Brown Rice Flour. Their BRF is so fine that it is almost silky. If you bake as much as I do, and want to use Authentic Foods BRF for everything, you should look into getting a second job. That stuff is PRICEY. If you don't want to get a second job, Bob's Red Mill BRF is the way to go, but your baked good will suffer a bit due to the sandy, gritty texture of this flour. Through trial and error, you will find that it works fine for some recipes, but others may seen a bit more gritty and crumbly. Processing this BRF in the Cuisinart or blender doesn't seem to help. So, I plan to beg Bob to choose a finer grind for the BRF his company produces. PLEASE. Pretty please? I would love you forever. …",37 out of 38 users found this review helpful
 Highly recommended,5,"This sea salt is excellent for cooking but also for general use. It tastes superior to any salt that I've ever tried and since it's harvested from cold, northern seas it has a much richer mineral content. Magnesium is especially important for the body and many studies show that approximately 2/3 of people are deficient in this element, this salt has a higher magnesium content than any other that I know of thanks in large part to the minimal processing that it undergoes. * Celtic Sea Salts are a prime condiment that stimulates salivation, helps to balance and replenishes all of the body's electrolytes * It provides renewed energy * It gives you a high resistance to infections and bacterial diseases * It supplies all 82 vital trace minerals to promote optimum biological function and cellular maintenance * It balances alkaline/acid levels * It restores good digestion * The natural iodine in these salts protects against radiation, atomic fallout and many other pollutants * It can aid in relieving allergies and skin diseases * And overall greatly reduces toxins and to help prevent ill-health * Properly stored, salt keeps virtually indefinitely …",21 out of 22 users found this review helpful

" A great, comprehensive starter kit",5,"This kit comes with pretty much everything you need to get started in the molecular gastronomy world. You get 50g of each additive, which is just about perfect. Since most solutions are 1-2% by weight, this gives you plenty to help you get over a learning curve, create some dishes, and become familiar with each component. It's much easier to gauge what you need to reorder (and how much) once you have this basic understanding. Each additive is labeled for easy identification, and a guide that provides a brief overview is included for reference. The packaging is great as well -- each ingredient comes in a resealable pouch, and all of your pouches come in a small little cooler for storage (about 12""x12""x12""). Be sure to purchase some scales if you are already not equipped with them to go with your kit as well. You will absolutely need a scale accurate to at least 0.1g. You will also need a kitchen scale to measure the larger solutes (such as water) as almost all scales accurate to 0.1g cannot handle heavy loads. In all, this is a great buy.

" Less Tuna per can,  but a much better buy now!",5,"I was a very long-time loyal buyer of Wild Planet of Minimal Mercury Wild Troll-Caught Albacore Tuna until Wild Planet decided to eliminate the minimal mercury tuna and simultaneously cut the size of their can from 6oz to 5oz. The surprising and very good news is that they also cut the price from $27 to $16. So the price actually went down from $4.50 per can to $2.67 per can. That brought the price per oz down from $0.77/oz to $0.55/oz. ---- a very substantial (almost 40%) savings! The quality is still very good, and it's actually a much better buy now. On the minus side, I do not like the fact that Wild Planet decided to ditch the Minimal Mercury Albacore and instead is pushing it's Minimal Mercury Skip-jack tuna instead. Additionally, I am not thrilled that this product is now coming from Vietnam---according to the product description. I prefer my troll caught albacore tuna to come from clean waters of Alaska or Oregon. But in light of today's economy, getting such excellent tuna for almost 40% less --- only $0.55/oz when a closely equivalent version previously cost $0.77/oz is a remarkable and welcome change. UPDATE! This product is going for $29.95 + shipping on the Wild Planet website. So the Superstore price of $16 is a super bargain and probably won't last. I am going to stock up while I still can!!! …",24 out of 27 users found this review helpful

 awesome.... from ONE fulfillment warehouse,5,"The first container I purchased was excellent quality so I purchased a second and then a third. Unlike the first and second the third was shipped by UPS and was mildly dented, but that is not a concern for *this* type of product.

Before discovering the less than awesome quality of the third container I had already purchased two more containers. I am hoping five and six will be the fame FANTASTIC QUALITY of container one!

This information was not on the Superstore product page at time of purchase :( I hope my ginger is not seasoned with lead.

As a food product I insisted on replacement. Eventually after shaming Superstore via [...]they condescended to ship a replacement. The replacement canister was cosmetically damaged but air tight. Canister six was similarly dented but air tight. Canister six ginger had a higher ""thread count"". _beware_ Superstore seems to have a policy of not-bothering to include sufficient padding according to UPS/FedEx guidelines.

 Try McMate Coca tea. It's remarkable!,5,"Paper wraps are known to dry the delicate crushed coca inside the tea bags and the ink used can alter the flavor. McMate Caranavi is a Eco-friendly line.

Concentrated coca drinks and the like have been reported as a treatment for malaria side-effects, asthma and respiratory tract problems, help to improve digestion and to treat ulcers, prevent digestive problems, as an aphrodisiac agent, and credited with improving general health and longevity.

 Single Malt and Cigars.,5,"Lapsang Souchong tea comes from the mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits. This tea has an unmistakeably smokey note, which for years made it a particular favorite with the ""single malt and cigars"" crowd of English clubs and drawing rooms. That aroma is created during the tea's smoking process, which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires, after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there. Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long.

You can get the same results with a good food processor (i.e. a Kitchen Aid). This is NOT a fine, even grind. If I sift the product, I find a lot of chunks. I want a fine EVEN grind when using nut meal/flour (the terms are used interchangeably in the industry) as the main or only flour in my baked goods. Since this brand is easy to find in many supermarkets, I do recommend it for some uses. It's good for folks who don't do mail order, those non-GF cooks looking to lower the carb count of their bread coatings, and those looking for an easy GF or a no-carb ""breading"" option, but only when a coarse coating is suitable. For instance I like fine coatings if I'm going to ""pan fry"" a white/light flesh fish fillet. When used as the main or only flour for baking, the batter will look lumpy and the finished product will taste a bit gritty. It won't perform well in some recipes because the chunkier nature of the grind will affect the way the batter handles moisture, which could result in a dense rather than light texture. It could also yield products that fall severely upon cooling.

My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two. At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 A great way to learn about different flavors,4,"This is a great way of learning about different cheeses, and what there flavors are.<p>Gorgonzola is a stronger cheese, usually used for salads - very tangy with a stronger after taste, something I think everyone can really enjoy in that matter. A classic is romaine lettuce, gorgonzola and apple slices.<p>In contrast, gouda is a milder creamy cheese, great for breads. If cheddar were a starting point, I would say gouda is more creamy. It tends to break and crumble less easily, and really stick to bread surfaces better.<p>Both will make you forget about the normal supermarket colby or cheddar. I recommend this sampler highly. …",29 out of 34 users found this review helpful

 Green tea powder for life!,5,"At first glance it may seem that this product is somewhat expensive--$30+ for tea, right? But a pound of green tea powder is A LOT!!! For a 6 oz cup of tea or most other uses you only need to use about a half a teaspoon or things get a little strong and murky. But I add it to everything--my morning protein shake, yogurt, Gatorade for the gym, etc., etc. and still I have yet to make a dent in the bag. I have also looked at green tea powder at places like Whole Foods and Asian super markets, and this is a really good deal in comparison.

 Wonderful product,5,"I have 2 black lab mix dogs (littermates). They are now 2 years old. They didn't tell me when I got them that part of the mix was beaver. These dogs can chew anything. If it squeaks, it takes on average 10 seconds from being new to being destroyed. Don't even get me started on toys that have stuffing. Within the last two weeks, I've started allowing them to be uncrated in my house without me there. Previously, they were completely untrustworthy, but I feel really guilty crating them while I'm at work. And I thought they were acting more grown up. Not chewing my stuff, just theirs. So, I came home one day to find a highlighter destroyed (on carpeting, of course). The next day the victim was one of their dog beds that they'd always left alone. So, out of desperation I tried this product (and paid way more than the price at Superstore at a local pet store). These things are AWESOME. They keep their attention for hours and a treat lasts for about 2 days. My one dog loves hers so much that she's like obsessed with it. And the material it's made of seems to be unchewable to them (which I initially worried about, having not found anything in nature or manmade that they couldn't destroy). I love these things. …",92 out of 93 users found this review helpful
 I'd buy this again and that says alot,5,"We eat a lot of rice, usually brown rice or red rice or the darker grains and most times use an electric rice cooker unless I'm preparing risotto. There are instances, however, when I simply don't have the time to prepare rice and until now, I didn't consider options other than freezing leftover rice in small packages for emergencies. I never cared for Uncle Ben's Minute Rice and assumed that any prepared and packaged rice would be similar to that rice which one of my sisters adores. Annie Chun's Rice Express Multi-Grain Sticky Rice has proven my aversion was unwarranted because this product has turned out to be a lifesaver when having only a minute's time. Now if you don't have a microwave or pot with water and source of heat, I don't think this would be very good, but if prepared as directed, it's quite delicious and I'll buy it again. The texture is like sticky rice, the flavor is like multi-grains, the color is speckled and appealing, and it's great to have at work with leftovers. Sprouted brown rice is a definite winner. Since no refrigeration is needed, it's safe in a drawer and is a relief even when you have forgotten to bring in something else. In my opinion, since it's rice, you can add practically anything and have an enjoyable meal full of good carbs. With no oil or salt added, you cannot go wrong with this rice! Finalize those details according to your own tastes and dietary restrictions. Because of the cost, I'll continue preparing rice in the electric rice cooker, but for appropriate times, this will be a household staple. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 FANTASTIC,5,"My daughter is 5 months old and has been struggling since the day she was born with constipation, gas, and reflux. We've tried formula after formula after formula, nothing but vomit and severe constipation. Finally we found a formula that helped with her constipation but she was still having problems with her reflux, even with added rice. The drs however continued to say she was at a steady growing rate so there was nothing to worry about. Well, one day I ran out of formula and ran to the store to pick up some more. FORTUNATELY, the store was out of the Similac Alimentum. Nearing her feeding time, I was in a rush, so I glanced over the other formulas to find one that would be the closest match. I just happened to pick up Similac Sensitive R.S. Now not only is she not spitting up, she's staying full longer, sleeping through the whole night, and SHE'S NOT GASSY OR CONSTIPATED!!! HURRAY! Another minor pro is that it doesn't reek like the Alimentum does. Kind of smells like Vanilla Flavored Ensure. I called all my friends just days after buying the product and recommended it to everyone. I couldn't be anymore grateful. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 These brownies are horrible,1,"Here's a review by someone who is not fat, not on a diet, and who has not ruined his palate with fat free confections: These are the worst brownies I have ever tasted! My wife bought this mix because it was the only one available at Trader Joe's when she shopped. She didn't tell me they were fat free, but as soon as I tried one, I knew. It had all the hallmarks of fat-free baked goods - gummy, flat, and the chocolate tasted like cocoa powder, not like rich fudgy chocolate. I almost had to spit it out, it was that awful. And do you want to know why fat free foods taste so bad? I'll let you in on a little secret: the secret ingredient in good-tasting food is... you guessed it - FAT!!!!! Fat and oil molecules transport the lovely taste of foods onto your taste buds. So stop being so afraid of fat! A little bit won't kill you! Just exercise a little self-control and don't eat the entire box. One properly made brownie is more satisfying than a whole plate of these vile things. So if you like real food that tastes good, don't believe the reviewers that raved about these brownies. These people have a hidden agenda - they are trying to convince themselves that these little nuggets of evil actually taste good and are good for them. …",7 out of 49 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 What an Item of Wonderment!,5,"Let me take you back to a cold Christmas morning, stockings hung over the fireplace, the tree trimmed with all manner of fanciful decorations, and small children fast asleep, ready to awaken to the dawn of the best day of the year. My eyes flew open as the sun peeked above the bottom of my window pane. It was the day that everyone had been awaiting all year! Practically bludgeoning my siblings out of the way, I made a dash for the stockings. I always had gone for the stocking first. A few gift cards, some candy, maybe even a Pez dispenser. Nothing too exciting. What I smelled next, however, made my heart skip and my breath catch. I knew exactly what was under the tree for me. As mother and father watched on warmly, my siblings and I tore through the wrappings of our gifts. Soon they'd all be jealous of me. No one was going to get something quite so special as what I was about to receive. The room was soon filled with the invigorating scent of red meat and blood. I became dizzy just fantasizing about spending long hours with my new gift. I finally pulled the last shred of dripping, rotting wrapping paper from the carcass, my eyes lit with the purest of joys. I'd gotten just what I'd asked for. The beautifully gory dead rabbit, its skin peeled off in some enticingly cannibalistic way, oozing blood and pus and its bones skewed at odd angles, hung limply in my arms as I squeezed it tightly like a stuffed animal. ""Thank you!"" I squealed in pleasure before running off to my room with the decaying corpse to snuggle. What more could anyone possible want? A dead rabbit is the greatest, most useful thing that anyone could ever buy. It truly was a night of wonderment, and one that my family and I will always remember. …",24 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 The Best,5,"I had the opportunity to try coffees all over the world and have found a few that met my taste. An excellent prepared Kona coffee in an upscale hotel in Hawaii with coconut pancakes was my favorite. Dallmayr Prodomo is the best everyday coffee with a consistent smooth and full coffee taste. The water is a major factor though--filtered water often helps. Having lived in Asia, America and Europe and traveled to many coffee loving countries, (try France, Italy, Turkey, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Hongkong--before it was returned to China), and many others, I know a wide variety of coffee roast/beans/brands. Still, with filtered water, this is the most consistently smooth tasting coffee readily available. Be careful though, once the vacuum seal is broken the coffee loses its flavor fast. I usually buy in larger quantities and often receive a package that is a ""reject."" But I have seen people picking up ""soft"" packages of coffee (a sign that the vacuum packaging is compromised) in the commissary and in other stores--I always wondered about that. To enhance the flavor of coffee that has been out of the vacuum pack for a few days, just add a pinch of salt to your coffee when you brew a pot, sometimes a hint of Dutch processed cocoa. Use quality filters for drip style coffeemakers (I prefer for everyday the cold brew method), and realize that you have to be able to adjust your coffeemaker to allow for the much finer grind of German coffee. So, a good coffeemaker is half the battle. …",14 out of 21 users found this review helpful

" Holy SALT, Batman!",2,"We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a ""healthier"" alternative to regular chips. I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip. The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor. The big issue with these is the sodium level. After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt. A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like. I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.

 Multi Cat Family - All Of Them Love Newman's Own Pet Food,5,"We switched to Newman's Own dry and wet food several years ago. We have noticed a huge difference in our pets. Yes, we have cats and dogs all who are rescues. Because of their early history, many have health issues. Since switching them to Newman's Own most have leveled out and we spend less time at the Vet. The food cost less in the long run, because of better health for your animals. We also noticed that all of our animals love this product. Some of them like the dry better than the wet and vis-versa. Some of ours where picky eaters and needed to gain weight. Not anymore, they all show up for dinner eager and ready to eat.

" Good ingredients, bugs are common",4,"I have purchased other potting mixes and been horrified to find bits of chewing gum, crushed tin cans, etc in them. I've never had this happen with Miracle Gro. Miracle Gro makes a good mix, at a decent ratio, which is great for growing most standard houseplants and excellent for growing from seed. As for the gnats: Fungus Gnats can be found anywhere there is rot. Don't clean your sink for a week - see those bugs? Same thing. They eat rot. They cannot live in dry soil. THE BEST PREVENTION for fungus gnats is to water with either a drip-irrigation system (plastic tubing with holes in it, hidden beneath the soil surface) or water bottom-up (water the dish under the plant, and let the soil soak the water upwards). The fastest and most common way to become infested is to overwater your plants. I did this one year - we had them everywhere, in all our food, on the walls, and it was disgusting. If you already have an infestation, try lowering the frequency of your waterings - your plants won't get dehydrated from a little less if the gnats have been happy with what they've had. Let the soil top dry completely before you water - gnats and their young live near the top, in damp soil. Yes, I've seen more gnats with this than other soils. However, that could easily have been because the batch I had had been kept more damp in the store than the other stuff. Water less, you'll have fewer gnats. Get Scott's and be prepared to be disappointed (that's the brand I found the crushed tin-can pieces and gum in). …",24 out of 24 users found this review helpful

When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee. Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about. When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing. Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe. My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day. Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one. It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite. I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it. I hope you like -- no strike that -- I hope you love this coffee as much as I do. …",172 out of 174 users found this review helpful
 If you like fish..............,5,"This product is evidently produced in Canada, probably in New Brunswick, from wild herring harvested in or about the Bay of Fundy or the Gulf of Maine. The herring are filleted and then lightly smoked before canning. The result is a delicious, healthy and wholesome food item that mates well with warm, crusty French bread or multi-grain crackers. Highly recommended. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Aerogarden refill kit,1,"Shipping was fast. Grow tablets were sealed in celephane and, obviously, are giving off moisture as it is collecting in each separate pouch. Doubt they will last the year they are supposed to. Also, I am not ""couch potato as it says in the title. …",0 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Need to brew small cup size.  Check the price!,3,"I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this. Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans. We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally. I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery. I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed. I usually brew on the 3rd largest size. I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes. This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews. Those who can only brew (or choose to brew) smaller sizes probably like this coffee. Make sure you check the price before you buy. Click more buying choices to get to Superstore's price which is almost half the price of Liquid Nation's and it is eligible for prime. Why doesn't that show up as a default? …",27 out of 28 users found this review helpful
 Not sure bottle was sealed,2,I srewed the top off the bottle without removing the hard plastic pull ring. Makes me wonder if it's safe to use. There is not other covering and I put the cap back on and it looks like it's never been opened! Since it's a powered supplement this doesnt look safe. I gave it a two because of the seal and the fact that I'll probably have to return it. …,2 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Disappointed,2,Really nothing special. Description said twice as sweet as regular sugar & only need to use half as much. We didn't find that to be so. The tast of maple was hardly evident. Really not worth the high price. …,9 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 even worse than expected,1,"Everybody seems to believe that Snickers are awesome. But I just don't see it. Up until recently, I had never tried a Snickers bar. But unfortunately, I lost a bet with my friend (Walter). Otherwise, I would never have eaten a Snickers bar. Now that I have eaten a Snickers bar, I can say with absolute conviction that they taste awful. I recommend Ding Dongs or Ho Hos. …",3 out of 70 users found this review helpful
 No good . . .,1,I read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup. They will not touch it. Even if I mix it with home cooked food. They like the dollar store dog food better than this. Superstore let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name. …,0 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Great Greens!,5,"What is great about the Salad Greens Seed Kit is the AeroGarden. The instructions make everything very easy and it has been such a pleasure to watch the tiny seedlings pop up. Watching the greens leaf out, waiting for them to grow large enough to start harvesting was such a pleasure and then to snip off leaves right in the kitchen to toss into our salad bowls was a real treat - and healthy! We are now watching baby herbs sprout! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Country of origin is news to me,1,"These packages contain less than the ones I have bought at CostCo for several years and cost more, by the time you figure S/H. Our store no longer carries them so I was happy to find them on Superstore. The order arrived and I was shocked to find notice on the outside cartons that they are NOT a product of USA. True, that info is in tiny font at the bottom of the printing on back of the packages but I had never noticed. I will not be buying these again and will read labels much more carefully in the future. …",17 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 Truly delicious coffee!,5,"I have tried many of the K-cup coffees. The Newman's extra bold is one of the best. Absolutely no bitterness. Strong, flavorful and mellow all the way. You will love it. (Unless you're a fan of weak coffee). …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 OMG - The horrors....the horrors.,1,"Everyone in my family shares my opinion that these things taste absolutely HORRIBLE. I feel really bad for someone who needs to eat Gluten/Dairy/Soy-free or Vegan/Kosher foods. If I had to live on these alone (and I don't), I'd convert back to being a non-vegan or whatever. We all tried the Cherry Pie flavor, and what this thing has to do with cherry pies is way beyond me. It's a lump of semi-solid goop with some nuts and dried fruits that taste sour and bitter and somewhat sticky. Simply gross to the point I couldn't even finish one bar. I may not be a health food nut, but I know what tastes like **** when I taste it...and these things are **** all the way. Steer clear. Even 1/2 hour after, I still have that horrible taste in my mouth and need to go brush my teeth to get rid of it. …",1 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Great Snack!,4,"I am generally not a fan of pretzels. I have tried pretzel after pretzel in all shapes and sizes to no avail. I finally stumbled upon these one day and I have been loving them ever since. They provide a nice pretzel taste without having an overpowering amount of salt. I only have two complaints about the product: 1. Brown rice syrup as an ingredient. While it is organic, I would rather it not be in there because of a few health effects. 2. The pretzels are coated in salt and not sea salt. Sea salt is the healthier of the two and should be recognized as such in an organic product. On the whole, great product. …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 WAAAAAAYYYYYYY OVVVVEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRR  PRICED!!!,5,"I usually buy them at walmart because theyre MUCH MUCH cheaper than buying them at Starbucks. You guys are kidding, right?

I cant believe you guys are charging so much for these little drinks. Seriously, you need to come down off the price. …",20 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 No no no no!  How could they go so badly wrong?,1,"Boy oh boy. Walden Farms is really a hit and miss operation. I think this stuff is probably my least favorite of their products I've tasted so far. What makes no sense is that the ingredients that might add alfredo-esque taste, if they would choose to employ them in the recipe, aren't caloric. Spices and salt would go a long way toward making this stuff edible. I will add that though the sauce is also as thin as h-e-double-hockey-sticks, I can deal with that in a zero-cal food. That's a sacrifice I can live with. But it's the sickly-sweet flavor and the lack of any sort of savory component that makes this stuff such a startlingly-awful flop. I suspect there's a whole lotta Splenda goin' on in this stuff. Give it a pass and just thin out some other bottled ""lite"" alfredo sauce using fat-free milk. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 My Cat's Favorite Toy,5,"My cat loves these so much that I bought ten packs of them just in case they stop making them. Seriously. She purrs the minute I pick one up. She likes to play fetch with these so any time I'm around she brings one to me and meows until I throw it for her. Then she has a great time chasing it around the room until she catches it. I have to put them away at night, though, since she'll bring them to my bed and meow for me to throw them. This is the best cat toy ever. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
