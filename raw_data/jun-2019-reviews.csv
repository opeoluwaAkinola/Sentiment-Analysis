 Totally unnecessary but love it anyways!,4,"This is one of the most unnecessary and ridiculously over-priced baby items I own, yet I can't help loving it. Common sense tells me that I could just as easily cook food on the stove and puree it in a blender, in even greater quantities than are allowed by the Beaba Babycook, but this is such an adorable little appliance, with such a straightforward cooking process, that it totally motivates me to use it and hence we have a freezer full of baby food cubes. It is definitely NOT useful, however, for reheating food - I followed the directions for defrosting/reheating, and it came out scalding hot. The other minus is that it comes with very few recipes, even on the website that initially looks impressive but is actually quite sparse. Bottom line - if you're a sucker for attractive kitchen gadgets and have a rich uncle who wants to buy you an extravagant shower gift, this is the perfect item! Otherwise, buy a blender - at least you can make frozen margaritas with it as well. Update: 3 months after I purchased the Beaba, I still use it CONSTANTLY. Occasionally, I bake or steam food using the oven/stove and blend it in a blender, but I have to say that the Beaba is much more convenient. And I would now up my rating to 5 stars - I recently got distracted while steaming some beets on the stove (imagine that, getting distracted with a 9 month old son) and burned out the bottom of the pot. The Beaba is now the only thing I use for steaming because it automatically turns off when it's done cooking, and I can't stress enough the peace of mind I get from this safety feature, as any mommy with baby brain can understand! If you can afford it - buy it. …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Tasty but Gassy!,2,"The taste alone deserve all the accolades I found from fellow reviewers before I bought this product (4 Boxes). There were only two reviews, one for 5 stars and the other for 4 stars. Not one mentioned the after effects this product causes in the human body. Who said gas is expensive? With this product is free and long lasting! The first time we did two boxes, which is not much in quantity, and the whole family had a go at it. I bought it for selfish reasons, the fact I am not supposed to consume sugars and lots of Carbs, but more importantly because the two reviews sold me! Who else can I trust these days when everyone claims they are the best but the actual consumers, the everyday people of this great land of ours? Yes, I am that naive, I fully trust the opinions of the majority. In this case they were only 2 reviews and I should have been more cautious. The taste great but after eating this product the body undergoes severe swings, all adorned by long lasting gas and in the end by several visits to the ""throne"". I have always been blessed with a reliable stomach but when I eat something that is not quite right I suffer like everyone else. Another member of my family suffers from a very delicate stomach and almost no will power when it comes to treats like these. There must be some kind of ingredient that promotes this reaction and my question is: Is it safe to suffer the after effects for the taste of the moment you eat it? In my opinion, no, even though I know that some ingredient that makes it sugar free might be the culprit and perhaps the body will adapt and in time become more adept at accepting this side effect, but I do not want my body to participate in the adaptation process. So why was this not mentioned at all? That, in a nutshell, is the question. Are we being difficult and antagonistic? From where I stand (or should I say, sit?) I do not think so. 2 Stars for Doctor's Carbrite Extra Rich & Fudgy Brownies and the 2 stars for the initial great taste, at least that part is true and tried! …",9 out of 15 users found this review helpful

" Flavor okay, not great",4,"I struggled with rating this bar a 3 or a 4. Taste is only about a 3, but quality of ingredients in providing a healthy and edible alternative to a candy bar rates it a solid 4. Below is the gist a a review I wrote for Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Cherry Pie comparing it with the PURE Wild Blueberry Bar. When I was searching for a healthier between meal afternoon snack I read a lot of reviews for a lot of products. I wanted something with few ingredients, not ""fortified"" and with some nuts in it. I settled on the Larabar Fruit & Nut Cherry Pie bars and the PURE Bar Organic Wild Blueberry Living Food Bar. I love cherries and I love blueberries so they seemed like good choices. The stats of the bars are very similar, weight (both 1.7oz, not 1.8), calories, fat, sugars, etc. The PURE has more protein at 6g vs 4g. The Larabar has no sodium while the PURE has just a bit at 5mg. The Larabar is thicker, the PURE bar is wider. Visually the Larabar appears to have more nuts in it, which doesn't seem to jive with the protein stats. The PURE bar has a grittier texture while chewing so maybe more of the nuts are finely ground. 1st ingredient is dates for both followed by almonds and then cherries for the Larabar and followed by blueberries and various nuts, organic agave nectar, rice protein and lemon juice for the PURE bar. One would think with the extra ingredients in the PURE bar they were added to tweak the flavor or give it a fresher taste, but the flavor of the Larabar is better than the PURE by a pretty good margin. It has a much fresher and lively taste. I have to say the PURE bar is a bit cardboardy tasting to me and has a drier mouth feel. It is not bad, in fact my 2 youngest kids eat them readily, just not nearly as good as the Larabar. I think the tartness of the cherries in the Larabar kick up the flavor vs the milder blueberry flavor of the PURE (maybe the lemon juice add as an attempt to kick up the PURE bar flavor and tartness?). In fairness I should probably review the PURE Cherry Cashew bar but I much prefer almonds over cashews so don't plan on ordering any from Superstore. If I stumble on the PURE cherry in a regular store I will give one a try though. I still get both auto shipped from Superstore for variety sake, but am looking for a better tasting blueberry bar w/ basic ingredients including nuts. For grins here is a comparison of the Larabar, PURE, Snickers, Hershey's and Maruchan Chicken Ramen noodles in a few categories. Stats are listed in the order I listed them in the previous sentence. Calories: 190, 190, 280, 210, 380 Total Fat: 8g, 9, 14, 13, 14 Saturated Fat: 0.5g, 1, 5, 8, 7 Sugars: 21g, 20, 30, 24, 0 Protein: 4g, 6, 4, 3, 10 Sodium: 0mg, 5, 140, 35, 1540 !!! UPDATE Nov 11, 2009 PURE has changed this bar. I got my regular shipment and noticed the bars came in a newly shaped box and new packaging. Total fat went from 9g to 8g and they eliminated all sodium. Total carbs edged up to 26g from 25g. Protein remains 6g and calories at 190. The BIG CHANGE is that ""Organic Wild Blueberries"" drops from the 2nd item listed on the ingredients list to the 5th! Blueberries are now after not only dates but walnuts, cashews and rice proein concentrate. Bumping up the nut content would not be a bad thing, but since the total fat actually decreased and carbs increased, I think the nut quantity actually decreased along with the blueberries, but the date quantity increased. This seems to basically be a date bar w/ nuts now and some minor blueberry content. I'd love to see the actually quantity of blueberries in this bar. Ironically, I can actually see blueberries scattered in the new bar, whereas the old bar was more of a dense blended mush. The bar is noticeably lighter in color now (and density)...more tan than blue. The new packaging implies a longer slimmer bar shape, but oddly the actual bar is shorter, wider and a tad thicker...package marketing? The total weight is unchanged at 1.7oz. I'm still looking for an alternative blueberry bar...I imagine cost is a big factor in blueberry content. My 2 kids will still eat these but they noticed the change right away and are not impressed. …",97 out of 105 users found this review helpful

 Best Nuts on the market!,5,"I love Brazil nuts. I think I am a connoisseur of a Brazil nuts. I like them fresh and crunch. Unfortunately, these nuts tend to be expensive so I shop around for the best price. I bought 3 packages of nuts from this company and 2 packages from Nut Company Brazil Nuts Whole Raw, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2) to compare them. I tried NOW Foods Nuts first. They were delightful! They were fresh, crunchy and absolutely delicious. Then I opened Bergin nuts. There was no flavor to them. What a waste that was! I spent $21.98 for the nuts that are ROTTEN and SPOILED. There is NOTHING worse in the culinary world than chewing on a nut and realizing that it's spoiled. It takes 3 teeth brushing to get rid of that awful taste! Avoid even trying Bergin nuts! So, if you want good Brazil nuts, buy the product you are currently looking at: Foods Brazil Nuts, Raw, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3) I've bought from them 5 times and each time nuts are fresh and tasty, just like they are supposed to be.

 Unbelievable cherry taste,5,"Okay, maybe it's not exactly unbelievable, because it is exactly what good maraschino cherries looked and tasted like when I was a kid. They are dark. The syrup is thick and dark. The aroma is the essence of cherries and their presence in a cocktail is magical -- taking cherries from a flavorless, if colorful, garnish, to another layer of delicious bouquet and taste. Unless you are over 45, it is quite possibly you never tasted a maraschino cherry like these While the price is not inexpensive, the value, in terms of what is added to any drink or recipe with these, is quite high. Two of these cherries will outpower a dozen of those bright red ""things"". And don't let cocktails be the only use. Your children deserve to experience what a ""cherry"" cola or other soft-drink ""should"" taste like, or an over-the-top sundae or banana split. Similarly, I believe I am going to get my wife to make a Bavarian Schwartzwalder Kirchtorte (Bavarian Black Forest Cherry Cake) with these to really experience the sublime bliss that is cherry and chocolate. They muddle in cocktails extremely well and infuse the entire drink with an exquisite hint of cherry. Old Fashionds and Manhattans become more sublime, and cherries suddenly hold their own with oranges, lemons and other fruits in a cocktail. …",45 out of 45 users found this review helpful
 My biggest problem is the description...,4,"The description does not mention anywhere that ""nana"" is mint. I probably would not have ordered this assortment if I'd known that -- I absolutely detest mint, though I was able to pass the 10 mint tea bags to someone else. But as a result, I've paid for 8 varieties and gotten 7. Saying that, the others look to be good. The cherry tea has a wonderful fragrance, for example, so although I've not tasted all of the 7 I like what I've tried and gave it 4 stars. It's the usual problem with assortments: you can't control the mix. I got this because there looked like some flavors I really wanted, and it got a good review for quality. But it would be so much better if there were some way I could CHOOSE the flavors from a listing. …",5 out of 13 users found this review helpful

" Get educated, save $",1,"Even at $6 per canister, this product is inexplicably overpriced. Let me explain why: Intro to Oats 101--Oats, in whole form, are known as groats. In an effort to cut down on cooking time (or eating time, for those on the run, who don't have the time or patience to chew @mouthful 20-30x), oats are refined into the following: -steel cut oats--cracked into two or more pieces -oat flakes--flattened with an oat roller -oatmeal--same as flakes, but parboiled -instant oatmeal--more processed than reg. oatmeal -oat flour--milled into dust, for baked goods or as a thickening agent. This product fits into the first catagory. Their claim of ""guaranteed uniformity"" is a coined phrase, meaning each cracked grain is the same size, a gourmet characteristic. All this being said, I am not aware of oats from Scotland or Ireland having any magical or mystical quality, outside of marketing hype or myth. Truth be told, you could go to any health food store with a bulk bin (one sign of a conscientious health food store), buy whole oats, certified organic, for about $2 per lb., and crack your own oats with a grain mill (Corona brand, one time investment, about $70, lifetime expectancy), or in a blender. For those more ambitious, you could cook them whole, which involves soaking them overnight, then simmering for about 90 minutes. Do not be put off by the cooking time, it is unattended, with a flame deflector. Cooking becomes a chore because of prep time, not the time on the stove. Why whole? Because any time you grind or crack a grain, there is nutrient loss and, to those open to more estoteric models, a loss of life force (a.k.a. ""chi""). I did buy this product, and as connoisseur of oats, I was not impressed, did not give the same energy boost as others. Did not taste fresh, either. Now, onto an advanced concept: if you truly want the ""Rolls Royce"" of oats, there is a brand called ""Really Raw Oats"". Why is this? Because the oats commercially available are partially steamed to protect against rancidity (oats are about 10% fat, albeit an exceptionally healthful fat). How do I know this? Because a truly raw grain will sprout. Attempts to sprout other oats have been fruitless. The Really Raw Oats carry a price tag of about $11 per lb., but are worth it. Conversely, the product here, in my opinion, does not command the price point it seeks. p.s. the best TASTING oats I had came out of Canada--when you dry-roasted them in a pan, it took on the aroma of vanilla--BLISS! Haven't seen them, however, since the mid 1990's.

 Really Good,5,"This product is very good. I follow the directions exactly and mix it with water.. I havent tried mixing it w/ jelly or honey or anything else, as some others have suggested; the whole reason I bought this was because I wanted a lower calorie, lower fat alternative to regular peanut butter, so for me, mixing it with 150 calories worth of jelly doesnt make any sense. In any case, this is definitely NOT exactly like regular peanut butter.. the consistency is a little different, but I suppose you could adjust that to your own liking by adding more or less water. Also, you can definitely tell that this is a lower fat product than regular peanut butter; I mean, when you take a tablespoon of regular peanut butter, you can instantly taste and sense the richness due to the fat content, and when you eat PB2, you definitely notice the difference. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, just different. Its almost the same as if you are used to eating super premium, high fat ice cream, and then one day you switch to low fat; the low fat may still taste very good, but because you are so used to eating the high fat stuff, you will instantly notice a difference-- however, once you get used to it, it wont bother you. I would say PB2 is the same... its definitely NOT the exact same taste / texture as regular peanut butter, but its still very good. it has a very fresh, ""clean"" taste. in my opinion, its DEFINITELY worth the compromise, considering the huge amount of fat and calories in regular peanut butter, and how much healthier PB2 is in comparison . I have cravings for peanut butter just about every day, but up to now, I have only allowed myself to eat regular peanut butter about once a week, due to the fat and calorie content... but now, since finding PB2, I allow myself to have it whenever I want it. By the way.. I tried the PB2 Chocolate version-- I ordered a sample from their website-- it was OK.. not fabulous, not bad. to me, if I am going to really ""go for it"" and eat chocolate peanut butter anything, its not going to be a low fat version, because its just not worth it. in other words, if I had a craving for a Reeses peanut butter cup, chocolate PB2 would not satisfy that craving. On the other hand, when I have craving for regular peanut butter-- in a sandwich or right off of a spoon, regular PB2 will satisfy that craving without wrecking my diet. Bottom line: if you arent sure whether or not you will like this product, go to the Bell Plantation website and spend the four bucks and order a sample, and give it a try, then you will know for sure before you commit to buying 4 jars plus shipping. ( and folks, the shipping costs almost as much as the 4 jars, so make sure you like this before you order it! ) My final verdict is I am pretty sure I will be replacing regular peanut butter with PB2 for as long as they keep making it, and will probably order it by the case in the future to save on shipping. …",24 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 Dark and Delicious,5,"If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur. When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress. If being ""in love"" gives you a zest for life, then the ""I Love You"" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites. Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection (dark if you order this box): Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate. Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce. For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rêverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate. Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache. Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling. Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache. Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache. Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling. Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling. Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling. Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream. Also Recommended: If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations. Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior. My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September. ~The Rebecca Review …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful

" Fresh, flavorful, and hexane-free",4,"I've tried a few different brands of extra-virgin coconut oil, and for the most part I'm equally satisfied with them all. Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar. I should specify the qualities I look for in a coconut oil: I want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste, maximum nutrition, and minimal processing. For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil. I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find ""packed on"" and ""best before"" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the ""best before"" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet. According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as ""organic."" Do a little research; ""cold-pressed,"" ""organic,"" AND ""hexane-free"" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes. I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn't found it on sale at a good price. I put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar. …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 DEEEEEElicious!  My new favorite sweetener,5,"I've tried several brands of Xylitol and only disliked one (""Ideal"") because it contained other ingredients. This brand does not. The granules are sugar sized and it tastes like sugar and can be used like sugar. I even put it in my coffee bean grinder to see if I could turn it into powdered sugar and it worked (very quickly) and was delicious. The down side is that it became very hard a couple days later, but that may happen with regular sugar too...I know that powdered sugar is sugar plus an ingredient to keep it ""powdery"" so this shouldn't be held against Xylitol. Several things worth knowing about Xylitol: 1. It is very hard to tell the difference between Xylitol and sugar, both by the way it looks and the way it tastes. The only real difference is that it has a cooling effect on your tongue, rather like mint. It tastes like sugar on your tongue but I've found when cooking/baking with it, it takes a little bit extra (maybe 10%) to achieve the same sweetness. Also, it doesn't caramelize when heated. Xylitol definitely does not have a chemical taste to it like other sweeteners, which makes sense because it's not a synthesized product like other sweeteners. I far prefer it because I don't expect to hear about discoveries in ten or twenty years from now that it causes cancer or tumors. 2. If you want an artificial sweetener for diet purposes and don't care about chemicals, this probably isn't your best bet. It has fewer calories than sugar by about 40% but the artificial sweeteners have fewer calories. (I personally think chemicals are far more hazardous than calories, but to each his own!) 3. It kills harmful bacteria. A great use for this is dental care (you'll find it as an ingredient in many mouthwashes, toothpastes, and gum) and it works very well. I dip my toothpasted toothbrush into Xylitol sometimes when my mouth hasn't been feeling clean and after brushing my teeth, they feel smooth like after a dentist visit. Possibly the slightly abrasive effect of brushing with crystals has something to do with it but my mouth also feels pretty clean after drinking hot cocoa made with Xylitol and that's not the case when I make it with sugar. I use Xylitol because I have Candida and I can use the help killing it! 4. It is known to soften the stool and I have personally found this to be true. I told a friend about it and he now eats Xylitol specifically for this purpose, something I hadn't thought of. So one person's downside is another person's upside! I don't know if this is a universal effect but I would recommend keeping your intake small (a tablespoon or less) for a few days to see how it impacts your system. I baked a cake with it and didn't have a problem (and ate probably 1/4 cup of Xylitol that day) but I'm not sure if that was attributable to the baking or some other reason, perhaps the softening effect is achieved with a small amount and larger amounts don't increase it. …",85 out of 85 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 NOT what was expected.,3,"I was delighted to discover this product whilst browsing online for a birthday gift for my youngest daughter, who has recently turned six and has long been bugging her mother and I for a pet. As a busy father it pleased me that, in the modern age, a ""fresh whole rabbit"" could be crated up in a tiny, airtight box and the little fellow flown direct to me for my convenience, saving me much of the trouble associated with fatherhood. Although irksome that no individual pictures were attached (other than that of what appears to be a rather old, sleeping rabbit), it seemed to good to be true, especially when I learned it could be delivered in time for my daughter's party, to be opened and enjoyed by both the eager birthday girl herself and her rabble of little friends. However, much to my daughter's horror upon opening her much awaited, rabbit-shaped gift, she discovered what I now, after much consideration, believe to be - not a fresh or whole rabbit - but rather a dead rabbit - thus, decidedly neither fresh, nor, vitally....whole. Perhaps the vendors could consider selling this item under the heading ""deceased rabbit"" or ""rabbit corpse"" to ensure no future confusion amongst the realms of well-meaning, loving fathers, such as myself. Hysterical tears ensued, divorce was threatened and several children fled the house never to be seen again. More importantly, despite much coaxing I can't get the little fellow to hop around the hutch I built for him in the garden and, after a week, he is starting to smell (which, I grant you, is something that rabbits naturally do, but the neighbours are starting to complain). Mind you, this rabbit has proved most economical, as I have not had to replace the carrots and lettuce leaves in his bowl once since we got him. Must be on a diet. My wife has since left me, claiming she is ""taking the children to her mother's house"" as this is just too much after the ""fresh whole Pony"" I ordered for my eldest daughter's birthday last September. Why does no good, fatherly deed go unpunished? On the plus side, week old rabbit remains delicious. Thoroughly recommended as a snack to gnaw on whilst sitting on the sofa in one's underwear, watching football re-runs at 3 in the morning after one's wife has left one. …",52 out of 61 users found this review helpful
" Smells good, but tastes like coffee-flavored water",3,"These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces. It didn't help. I compared them to Senseo medium roast pods. The Senseo pods make a cup of coffee that is stronger but doesn't taste as good. I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee. I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides. As long as I'm having bad coffee, it might as well be organic and fair trade and all. So they are somewhat useful to me, hence three stars. Coffee maker: Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer Update: I stayed in a hotel with a small, cone-type coffee maker (not a Pod system). I put two Marley pods in the maker and made about 12 ounces of coffee, which I ran through the maker a second time (the first time it was very watery looking).

" Too Much Sugar, 83% By Weight!",3,"Initially I was a fan of Starbucks VIA Iced Coffee. It's convenient, it's tasty, and it's an affordable alternative to an in-store iced coffee. However after taking the product home, I was shocked to discover just how much sugar it contains. The first thing you notice when emptying the packet into a cup is the huge amount of white granules staring back at you. Each VIA packet contains 22g of sugar, and just 4.6g of coffee! This is the equivalent of SIX packets of sugar! Starbucks says each VIA is two servings, meaning 11g of sugar each, but you're likely to have the whole thing (14-16oz with water) in one sitting. That's 100 empty Calories (more if you're adding cream). PROS: Quick, tasty. CONS: Too much sugar, slightly bitter/burnt taste. NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: Starbucks needs to either cut the sugar content in half, or make a ""light"" version using Splenda or Stevia as a sweetener. …",45 out of 50 users found this review helpful

Having to order a minimum of two boxes from Superstore only compounded the problem. I am giving this product one more star than it otherwise deserves because when I called the company to complain, they did send me one free box of just coffee k-pods. However, the combination of deceptive labeling and having to throw away a third of the contents of the box unused makes this a poor product choice in my opinion.

 Can't live without it,5,"Having suffered from Chronic Candida Albicans for over 10 years, I finally came to terms with the idea that I CANNOT have any type of sugars or sweeteners, not even natural sugars from fruits. Being a fruit lover who used to eat lots of fruits on a daily basis, I started looking for a safe way to have sweet stuff without feeding the microorganisms that have been for so long attacking my system. After a lengthy research of more than a year, I found out that though most sweeterners FEED bacteria and Candida Albicans, Xylitol DOES NOT. I started using Xylitol regularly and found out, to my surprise, that my worst Candida symptoms were GONE. The symptoms would recur every time I had fruits (darn!)or something made with refined sugar or other sweeteners like Splenda or Stevia, or even the Aspartame that is used on Diet Drinks. Whether I liked it or not, it became clear to me that I could not eat or drink anything sweet, that I could neither have any fruits and that I could not drink any diet sodas. I have intensely and extensively ""tested"" Xylitol for over a year and I can AFFIRM without a doubt that it is the ONLY sweetener I can use without getting my symptoms back. I buy chocolates made with Xylitol on a regular basis and I use this brand of Xylitol to make chocolate bread and all kinds of cookies. I also make healthy chocolate ice cream with Xylitol, unsweetened cocoa powder and soy milk. If it were not for Xylitol, I would not be able to put anything sweet in my mouth. One of the most recognizable and annoying Candida Albicans symptoms was that I had to get up every one or two hours every night to urinate (!!). It was a nightmare, but it helped immensely when it came to ""testing"" what was good or bad for me. Conclusion: If I stay away from all types of sugars, natural fruits, fruit juices and sweeteners, and only use Xylitol-sweetened stuff, I feel much better in every respect and, very importantly, I can sleep 6 or more hours in a row without waking up to go to the bathroom. …",30 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 Coconut Palms and Ocean Breezes: Paradise Rising?,5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 9:08 Mins </span>While this review features the book, COCONUT OIL MIRACLE, it displays and describes other products [including coconut oil] which that book catalyzed into a healing synergy. I've reviewed most of the products shown in this video. Johanna Galt, thank you for your comment and question posted under the original written review I had submitted here, which I've deleted and replaced with this video [6/25/10]. Most of the content below was written in response to your question. I had purchased this brand a few years ago, and to be honest, I don't recall much about the flavor. It was my first experience cooking with coconut oil, and I hadn't yet read any books on it. The brands I've used recently and favor most for quality, aroma, and flavor are: EFAGold Coconut Oil, Extra Virgin, Organic, 16 oz. Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 2) Both of those brands, from my experience, are excellent quality. When I read Coconut Oil Miracle (by Bruce Fife) I learned a greater variety of uses of the oil and how to work with its relatively hard texture. I had kept it in the refrigerator until I read Fife's book and learned the oil [if it's in good condition when purchased] could be safely kept in the cupboard, usually for a year or more. There's lots of interesting, valuable information in that book, which helped me conveniently expand my usage of this miracle oil. I had recently read the later reviews on this NOW Foods offering and had felt that possibly I was lucky to get a better quality batch than some of those reviewers, because I don't recall the oil tasting off. But after reading those reviews and experiencing what might be higher quality products [linked above], I will probably stay with EFAGold or Nutiva, but I'm curious enough to try the NOW Foods product on this page again for flavor and purity comparison, in case the poor reviews came from an uncommon occurrence of a bad batch of the product. The EFAGold jar I received seemed to be of slightly higher quality, but Nutiva is very near as good, and sometimes priced more economically. The information on some of the Superstore product pages for Nutiva is interesting, very helpful, and impressive. I'm now cooking so much with the oil that I bought the larger size, Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 54 oz. But I will also keep the 15 oz jars, as they're convenient to take with me away from home. To be fair, I should buy this NOW brand again to compare it to these others which I've experienced. I've used other NOW Foods products and have been pleased with them. I've noticed additional brands available on Superstore which look good, too. From the information in Fife's book, I might try any oil which is cold pressed [ANH, absolutely no heat] and extra virgin. I LOVE cooking with coconut oil. It seems to me to enhance the integrity of the flavor of the food it's used with, and the savory flavor of beef steaks and other stronger meats can be furthered and the coconut edge removed by use of garlic, onions, and salty spices added to the oil when cooking. Some of my reviews on the above linked product pages give different information from this one, and hopefully more helpful written information from the original one which had been posted here. In view of some of the comments and the collected ""NO"" votes on that review, I decided to post this video, to delete the original written review, and plan to include a copy of it at the end of the first 6 comments which had been made on the original review. May pleasant aromas follow your nose, Linda Shelnutt NOTE: If you have a magnesium deficiency like many people are experiencing now, feel free to read some of my reviews on magnesium products for information about ways to retain that index mineral into your system at adequate levels. Most coconut oil has a lot of potassium in it, which can replace some of the needed magnesium. …",10 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 a little bit disappointing,3,"I've ordered beef jerky online several times over the last few years. It's usually overpriced at the store, especially when it comes in 1 to 2 oz. packets. Yes it takes a lot of beef to make beef jerky, but I suspect some of the big players in the industry are making a lot of money. So I try to keep my eye on the smaller outfits which will sell excellent quality jerky for $20 or less per pound. I think my favorite to date has been Tillamook Country Smoker, especially their hot varieties, though jerkyusa is quite good too. I've got a background in jerky which extends beyond what you'll find in the typical grocery or discount store, though I have eaten my share of those brands too. The price on the Golden Valley's Peppered Beef Jerky is excellent, so I figured that I'd give it a shot. I'd say that the two qualities that beef jerky should have are: 1)texture (esp. chewability) 2)flavor Regarding the texture of this jerky -- this particular batch was not great. Some pieces were better than others, but on average, it was pretty tough. I'd say it's a bit better than the megabrand that you'll find in most grocery stores, but I was expecting a little bit more. The flavor was OK, but nothing special. Overall, I prefer my peppered jerky to have more of a black pepper bite to it - this was definitely on the less seasoned end of the spectrum. In addition, the jerky had a relatively sweet flavor to it that I don't particularly like. I found this particular batch to be relatively average in both texture and flavor. I've decided to give it 3 stars because the price is very reasonable. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful

I am so happy we decided to try this coffee. We are now monthly subscribers. This is also the first review I have ever posted and I have bought quite a bit from Superstore. This coffee is GREAT! …,12 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Good Stuff!,5,"These are along the line of Slim Jims but have a milder, less spicy, taste. The X-Sticks also have a much better texture than Slim Jims, these things actually look like they are made of real meat, NOT the 'mystery meat - goat hair/cardboard' texture of the modern Slim Jim. The X-Stick is 'not exactly' a health food snack. They have a fair amount of fat, a little over 5 grams (each stick, in this package, is 14 grams total mass). Sodium content is about 224 mg and, about 3.2 grams of protein and only 64 calories (about 47 calories from fat) per stick. What the X-Stick is, is a very satisfying snack. I sometimes have to miss a meal, due to my work. One or two of these take the hunger away and puts some energy back into me. I do try to limit my fat intake but do not feel guilty about snacking on these once in a while. Enjoy. Ken …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful

" the best ""san marzano"" tomatoes",5,"I've been buying these San Marzano style tomatoes for at least ten years now. The can (I've got one in front of me as I'm writing) actually gives no information at all on where they come from, so I don't know on what basis one reviewer claims they are grown in California. (Also, the picture on the label is a not a photograph, but a stylized drawing of a tomato, and I think the contents do in fact look like the picture.) It would be nice if they were more up front about the provenance of the product, but... But all that's really irrelevant. I've tried a dozen canned versions of San Marzano tomatoes, mostly pricier and actually imported from the San Marzano region outside of Naples, and these are the tastiest: sharp, tart, depth of flavor, and very meaty. Individual tastes will vary, but if you put olive oil in a pan, cook some garlic, and simmer these bad boys for about 30 minutes, you'll have an amazing sauce, especially with a basil leaf or two. For that matter, these are as good as the tomatoes I've had actually in Naples, so I'm really not going to complain about where they are grown. Lastly, the crushed variety of these--which admits openly on the label that the tomatoes are grown domestically--is even better, producing amazing pasta sauces, pizza sauce, and the like. Superstore should carry that as well. …",8 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" These are good.  Very, very good.",5,"I don't mean ""good for a gluten free cookie"", or ""almost like a normal cookie"". No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good. No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells. No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture. They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free. No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also. According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well. That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff. You're probably wondering what the catch is, right? It definitely isn't the taste. As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good. I only see two drawbacks. 1) Cost. Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected. 2) Quantity. The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies. 16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them. However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us. I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag. Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating. Even so, I still wish there were more in a package. One last note, just because I found it to be unusual. Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight. These aren't. Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others. There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space. It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Very pleased so far,5,"Aside from digestive issues, I have suffered from adult acne in recent years. I have noticed a correlation between stress and breakouts (and that familiar female response once a month) however I have not yet found a complete system which had worked to eliminate my acne. After reading of coconut oil and Lauric acid, I have put it on trial... and have thus far experienced some impressive results..! It took about 8 days before I noticed the large cysts subsiding, and they have stayed away now for several weeks. Even my monthly cyst is keeping in check. Who would have thought rubbing your face with coconut oil twice and day and taking it internally would make the oily patches on your face actually improve? It seemed a little counter-intuitive, but so far I am experiencing some very clear skin... for the first time in years... Of course, I believe in coupling the outside assault with an internal one, so I have been taking the coconut oil daily (usually on bread or I just add it to cereal) as well as a wonderful greens mix (powder) and a pro-biotic. Of course, water is paramount, and I drink plenty every day, but I always did... Finding your balance is the most important thing - what is right for some is not always right for all - I will report back in a few months to let you know if the coconut oil has continued to impress me. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Purina Busy Bone - A Lethal Product for your Dog,1,"I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish. On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ½ year-old registered female Pug. Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone. I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves. I find this absolutely appalling. I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child. And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product. And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder. She's simply devastated - and angry. And so am I. Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children? Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for ""Best in Show,"" including the Chinese Pug? Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands? I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can). And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on. I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone. I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone. I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows. He certainly appreciates those visits. But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier. Spencer will turn 12 in May. Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues. Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog. And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today. His dog has given him something special - the gift of life. Something which Purina has stolen away from us. You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man. But tragically that's not the case. Yet there's more. We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill. Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion. And like us, he's now subdued. He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why. This concerns me. I am a professional photographer and writer by trade. I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence. Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well. As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later. The guilt is killing me. How can I write? How can I do anything? Grief passes they say. But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime. And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented. Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it. So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem. In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with. In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product. And why should such a product even exist? Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard? Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores? The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence. A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life. We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor. I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words. It's now the closest we can get to our special friend. We are utterly distraught. Greta, only 2 ½ years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever. It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina. The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.

 Does NOT promote healthy growth and development,1,"I was hoping that the new recipe would include more protein/fat than the original, since in my opinion, the protein/essential fatty acids that are abundant in salmon are the best reasons to feed it to a baby.

 Top of the samples line,5,"This coffee came with the ""starter pack"" for our Keurig coffeemaker and was near the last of the pack to be sampled. It rated 5/5 and #2 of 25 by Dad and #3 by Mom. Brewed/reviewed using the largest (automobile tumbler) water size. As stated, a ""bold"" taste with a heady toasted coffee aroma. This is a medium-body coffee, despite the implication on the packaging that it is a dark coffee (it is not a dark or french roast).

 This thing is ginormous!,5,"Wow! My dog has jaws of steel and can crack deer antlers, so I decided to go with this antler (and my dog is the size of a border collie). I got the Superstore Prime delivery to my work... I work in an elementary school. This antler is so big and heavy that I couldn't help laughing a little when I unwrapped it and showed it to my students. They suggested perhaps I use it to smack them when they are naughty (I wouldn't...this was their suggestion). Anyway, it's about a foot long, an inch and a half in diameter, and must weigh about a pound and a half. The only thing one might worry about is that the thing feels like a piece of concrete. A dog with a strong chew might break a tooth on it if he bit down the wrong way. My dog really chews on this, although he tends to lose interest in it unless I occasionally slap some peanut butter on the cut ends. He'll chew on it when he gets bored, too, but he's mostly a chewer who likes to chew for a purpose, and he can't do too much damage to this. Fortunately, he knows to not bite too hard, so no tooth damage has occurred. Keep an eye on your dog when he chews it, and avoid giving it to dogs who bite down too hard on things, especially if they have a history of chipping teeth. Great for dogs with strong jaws. Oh, and don't throw this thing. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" outstanding flavor, no MSG added, slightly lower sodium",5,"I have enjoyed nong shim's flavorful ramyun offerings for 10 years now. I only recently saw their Black label product and hesitantly indulged as it was $2 a pack. worth it for me. I think i like it a little better than their classic ""gourmet spicy"" and am now subscribing for a case every 6 months. It has beef and beef bone flavorings, perhaps an acquired taste, but they are well executed for an instant product. It's less piquant than the ""gourmet spicy"" classic flavor, but very rich in taste thanks to the beef bone extract and other seasonings. If you like nong shim's gourmet spicy, you'll probably like this. I like pork bone ramen (Tonkotsu) and really like this as it has the same milky richness in the broth. I am excited that it's relatively lower sodium (920mg per serving=half pack) than most similar products and apparently has no added MSG... with so much flavor they apparently don't MSG or so much salt. *edit- to other folks that prefer gourmet spicy... i agree that is a classic but enjoyed these more: very good broth especially, less heat but more rich flavor than gourmet spicy. the lack of sumptuous hunks of freeze dried beef doesn't bother me, I'll garnish mine with whatever I have in the fridge.

 Makes great coating for chicken or fish when mixed with breadcrumbs!,5,"I have been using Bob's red mill unsweetened coconut for about 2 years now and it's great. My favorite use for it is as part oif a coating for chicken or fish. You just toast the coconut in a nonstick pan until nice and deeply browned and then mix it half and half with Panko crumbs or regular breadcrumbs. Dredge your chicken pieces in flour, dip in egg and then coat with the coconut & breadcrumbs. I bake mine in the oven but you can also deep fry. This coating is also excellent for shrimp or scallops. Since it's unsweetened, you can use it in carribbean stews or any other savory dish. For baked goods it's especially helpful in controlling the amount of sugar in the final product. Coconut doesn't really need to be sweetened when it's added to other sweet ingredients. For example, those 7 layer dream bars with chcolocate and butterscotch chips as well as sweetened condensed milk don't really need sweetened coconut now do they? I also add this coconut to banana nut breads, chocolate brownies and icings for cakes. If you are making a regular white cake with coconut icing, you can punch up the coconut quotient by trhwoing in a half cup or so into the mix and then some more into the custard filling and get triple coconut cake! Yum. It's not hard to toast this coconut but be aware that once it starts browning, it browns VERY fast and will continue browning even after you remove it from the heat. Once you have bought this and used it, you'll find a hundred other uses for it. try the coconut encrusted chicken for something different! …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful

" Beware, not the same as the one from the Korean Market",1,"Just receive the noodle and try one. The package looks similar but not the same as the one that I got from the Korean market. I just finish the box of Shin noodle that I bought from Korean town so I know the differences right away. I thought I got a good deal and save a trip to Korean town. Guess not, I am wrong. I am going to the Korean town this weekend to get the real stuff. A little disappointed, I really want my authentic spicy red Korean Shin instant noodle tonight... This Shin noodle is made in the USA and it is a American version of the very popular Korean instant noodle. This American version is only one-third as spicy and the noodle get soft and mushy very fast like the regular instant noodle. The dry vegetable package does not go soft even after 10 minutes. To use the dry vegs in the future, need to soak it for at least 30 minutes so the dry mushroom will get soft. The spice package is orange color, the real Korean Shin noodle is bright red in color and the noodle will not get mushy after 10 minutes. I think it is something to do with the red pepper that the Korean use and not the picante in this USA version. It is spicy but taste totally different than the Korean kind of red pepper which make it so special. Really want to return it but since I got it with the lightning deal discount, I will eat it like regular instant noodle to save the hazzle. So beware if anyone reading this is Korean or have tried the real Korean Shin instant noodle. This is not the real thing, do not order this and do not pay full price for this American version of the Shin noodle.

These bags tear with any application of weight and do not trap odors whatsoever. In an attempt to be ""green,"" biobags miss the boat on basic trash bag functionality. Purchase at your own risk. …",5 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 jttodd,5,"Makes a great cup of sugar free-fat free 25 calorie hot cocoa! It's not quite as ""rich"" a product as some of the gourmet cocoas, but for those of us on restricted diets, it's a really good product. I like the canister because it's convenient and pretty much spill proof. I took the little single serving packets on vacation and they just don't travel as well as the canister.

 For the birds,2,I was surprised by the number of 5 star reviews of this product. Its a tiny gritty seed that gets stuck in every corner of your mouth and the taste is like nothing. Kind of like poppy seeds but with out the taste.

 So Decadent!,5,"For those who have never tasted a creamy hazelnut/almond/chocolate praline, you must try this! It's Nutella times 100!! Keep in mind it is very rich and creamy. Leonidas also has a Gianduja Emballee which is pure hazelnut/chocolate paste, which is to die for! And for all those comments I see about Godiva comparisons, pah-lease...it's apples and oranges. Americans do not know that there is better chocolate out there. People- take a journey beyond Godiva and you'll never go back. Promise! :) …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 half of the bag is amazing,3,"These chips are quite literally a mixed bag. If not for the yucca chips (I think it's the yuccas), this would be a solid 5 star bag of chips. The problem with the yucca chips is that they are very hard and difficult to chew. The reviewer below who complained of jaw problems after eating them was not off the mark. I had minor jaw pain myself after eating them. I am not sure why, but half to most of the bag consists of these undesired tooth killers. They are also the chips with the least flavor out of the bunch, so I'm guessing they are also the cheapest to produce. It's a shame, because the yuccas are really dragging this bag of chips down and keeping me from recommending it. Get with it, Terra! …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 High quality tuna that's easier on my conscience,5,"I originally tried Wild Planet tuna back in 2006 when Superstore carried their ""minimal mercury"" products, and I was extremely impressed by the taste and the quality of the tuna. I was never a fan of tuna in the past, but I thought their canned tuna was outstanding. They stopped selling tuna with the ""minimal mercury"" label, and I drifted away from buying tuna until recently. I decided to try Wild Planet again. I don't know if their ""low mercury"" label is any different or perhaps the standard definitions have changed, but the online discussions make be believe that the mercury content in this product is really quite low. The taste is still excellent, and I'm happy to see that the product is still like it was over three years ago - in that the chunks of tuna are large and nothing is added (besides salt in some versions). The natural juices from the fish keep it very moist and taste great. I also believe that their fishing practices are more sustainable and have less collateral damage (i.e. killing other animals) than other methods. That makes me feel much better about buying their products. Few things make me as upset as needless death or outright cruelty, and so while I enjoy eating meat and seafood, I look for people and brands that strive to avoid those things. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Does NOT promote healthy growth and development,1,"I was hoping that the new recipe would include more protein/fat than the original, since in my opinion, the protein/essential fatty acids that are abundant in salmon are the best reasons to feed it to a baby. Well, I should have taken the time to research the nutritional info before purchasing, because this item actually contains less of both. If you can manage to get your baby to eat an entire pouch of this, he/she will get a mere 1 gram of protein, or 6% of the RDA for a baby, .5 grams of fat, and 50 calories. That makes this a nutrient poor food. And HappyBaby a pretty despicable company. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful
" Excellent brew, economical too!",5,"With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time. Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?). I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig. It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well. I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags. This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup). Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here. Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like. Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there. Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder. Ok, on to the the ekobrew. They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing. The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds. Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew. I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill. I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter. Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper. I'll be looking into getting another one of these! …",44 out of 45 users found this review helpful
 Pure vanilla powder made of maltodextrin,3,"I deducted one star for the ""pure vanilla powder"" name, and another for not being as aromatic as pure vanilla, so 3 stars. I read the description above and thought I scrutinized the wording well enough to detect any misdirection, so unfortunately I didn't get to the ingredients list. I have some Rodelle vanilla pods and the fragrance is amazing. Compared to any vanilla essence I've ever tried, it's like the difference between freshly roasted coffee beans and folgers. So I thought this ""pure vanilla powder"" would be the closest thing ([...] bucks for a little jar!), and easier to use than vanilla pods. Well it turns out it's a jar of essentially corn syrup solids laced with vanilla extract. It's hard to avoid maltodextrin in pre-processed foods from the supermarket, but I'd rather not have it in my homemade foods too. It's a good thing that there's a powder version on the market, because it has its own kind of convenience, but it doesn't seem to me any more fragrant than regular extract, and unlike other reviewers' experience it seem like I do have to use more than liquid extract (also it cakes up terribly). Might be worth $3.50+shipping for the added convenience of the powder, but otherwise it's a pretty pedestrian product. Win some, learn some... …",42 out of 42 users found this review helpful

 Deceptive! Be warned!,1,"*** Buyer Beware: Note that all negative reviews are from Superstore verified purchases. The positive reviews may be shills! *** The ""tower"" is less than 1 foot and most of the stuff inside is paper straw filling. Imagine going out to the grocery store and getting a few random bags of low-quality chocolate and stuffing them inside a box along with straw. Hardly an item worth giving as a gift. Unfortunately, what you see in the picture is not what you get. I am not sure how other reviewers can give this 5 stars. I can only assume this is an item that's fulfilled locally and therefore quality varies. The items inside are worth less than 1/4 the price of the box. The only decent chocolate inside are the Ghiradelli squares. The peanuts inside the peanut covered chocolates had gone bad. Get something else. It's almost embarrassing to give this as a gift. …",58 out of 60 users found this review helpful

 They changed the Chips now they taste horrible,1,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy. I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan. About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket. I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it. After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to. They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed. So I e-mailed Kettle with the following: ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering."" I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag. This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks. Please let me know if I can be of any more help."" Well the next bag was good. Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost. I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company. So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle. Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand. increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand. Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same... …",20 out of 27 users found this review helpful
