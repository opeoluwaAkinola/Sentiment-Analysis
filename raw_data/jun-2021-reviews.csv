 Only buy if you are prepared to become addicted!,5,"This is one of those ingredients that people either love or hate - but most people I have served it to love it. The scent of the truffle in the honey is amazing. It is best served with a nutty hard cheese such as parmesan regianno (this is how it is served in Italy) and a mild cracker or bread. I have tried other brands which are also good and sometimes have more truffle flakes, but in side by side comparisons, I prefer this brand. Try this: Take a plain pizza shell with just a light brush of olive oil and some grated parmesan and a sprinkle of sea salt and bake until crisp and then remove from the oven, drizzle with the truffle honey and serve as a appetizer. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 My little yorkie is 14 years old and developed digestive problems a couple of years ago,5,"My vet gave him a prescription diet which helped him tremendously but he HATED it and wouldn't eat it until he just couldn't stand being hungry any more. With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return. Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription. Not only did he like it, he was fine! I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine! I was so happy! And so was my little dog! …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Popchips RULE!,5,"Popchips are really, really good! Don't expect a regular old, greasy potato chip, but DO expect something equally AWESOME that stands on its own. Popchips don't leave any funny residue in your mouth like some other ""diet"" chips, and they don't have a lot of fat and calories - only 100 cal. per single-serve bag! I got the variety pack, and liked every one of the six flavors - some better than others (because I'm not a big fan of cheddar chips by ANY maker, so these were as good as any), but all were good, most were GREAT. Even non-dieters who tried them liked them. It seems like they cost a bit more than the average bag of chips, but maybe that's because I had to buy a case. Even so, they're worth it if you're fighting the battle of the bulge and want a lo-cal indulgence you wouldn't otherwise be able to enjoy. My recommendation: EAT POPCHIPS! …",30 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 Mastered it!,5,"My cat enjoys feeding ****, and my dog loves his big Kong Wobbler so I decided to see if Nugget could manage this toy as a food dispenser. He is very interested in it and periodically bats at it to see if food will come out, but so far he hasn't mastered the necessary technique. We show him how it works by pulling on the attached attractant at the top to spill food out for him. That always gets his interest, but he just hasn't figured it out for himself yet. We haven't given up and are still hopeful that a light will suddenly come on. The concept is fine and the interest is there, but the motivation may not be high enough for a cat. I like the idea of my animals ""working"" for their dinner because it adds interest to their lives. It's what they are meant to do. We will keep trying with this toy and I'll update this review if we are successful. However, at least for my cat who is used to feeding toys and clicker training, this toy requires input from the human(s) in the family. That's not a bad thing. It's too easy to put the food in a bowl and walk away. Interaction is something we should encourage with our animals and the Kong Cat Wobbler requires that in our situation so far. (UPDATE) Nugget has mastered the Cat Wobbler at last and loves it! This took several months with us helping him spill food from it. At some point recently , he got the idea that food would come out if he just pushed it around enough. He uses the plume to pull it over. I love this toy for him because it is a real challenge. Nugget has cerebellar hypoplasia with moderate motor problems. He cannot jump or climb vertically, and he has an uneven gait. For him, any new skill or accomplishment builds confidence and makes him happy. I give him the Cat Wobbler with pellets (not filled because it would be too much food for him) several times a week when we go to bed. I hear him working with it throughout the night; he has emptied it by morning. It was worth the time showing him how to use it because it gives him something interesting to do for several hours at a time. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful
" Fresh, good price",5,"I bought several items from Barry Farms, all of which were very fairly priced and arrived promptly. It is not always easy to find pumpkin seeds that are shelled, ready to consume. Pumpkin seeds are chewier than sunflower kernels and can be tough or stale, but Barry's are crisp-chewy. Because I snack on them and toss them in the nightly salad, I haven't added them to homemade crackers, breads and muffins as planned, but I think they'll be ideal for those projects when I order more. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Not exactly water like,3,"I often drink vitamin and oxygen enhanced water so I thought I'd try this water due to the trace minerals. This was difficult for me to drink, the flavor is not water like and while it doesn't taste dirty or gritty, it's a mental thing. The water is very very black almost like a strong dark coffee. I'd strongly suggest trying a single serving before buying an entire case because out of 4 people in my family no one really liked it,...that leaves 20 bottles. …",64 out of 74 users found this review helpful
 McCann Steel Cut Oats,4,"SHIPPING As was stated by many others, the shipping for this product is too hard on the cans. Of my four cans, one was nearly undamaged. One had cosmetic damage in the form of a dented side. The other two were dented to the extent of having sharp creases in the bottom and flaws near the seal lines at the top. I never buy cans like those at the supermarket. COOKING The cooking went much better than I expected. The evening before, I put 1/4 cup chopped black walnuts, 10 pitted prunes cut into pieces with scissors, and two cups of water into my saucepan. I brought this mixture to a boil over a simmering-level flame on my propane stove. I dumped in one-half-cup of McCann's steel cut oats and stirred. I waited for the mixture to come to a boil again, stirred it a little, turned off the flame, put a lid on the saucepan, and went to bed. In the morning I was surprised to find that it was perfectly edible with no further cooking. I did heat it up again on the stove before serving but it stuck to the pot, so I think in the future I will microwave it right in the bowls just before serving it. EATING These oats were good, but it was hard to say if they were ""nuttier"" in flavor than the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats which I had been eating because I cooked them both with nuts. The texture was of course firmer. I do like bulgar wheat and these oats are more like that in texture. Since I was careful not to overcook the rolled oats, there was not much difference in the ""slime"" feel of the two, but the rolled oats were papery much like eating raw oatmeal cookie dough. NUTRITION I found little difference between the nutritional content listed on the McCann steel cut can and that listed on the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats container. I had to do some Internet research to find the differences which turn out to be subtle but important for certain types of health conditions. There is also the likelihood of the product simply being fresher due to less processing and better packaging at the mill. REPEAT PURCHASE Now that I have found that the cooking of steel cut oats is much less intimidating than I had imagined, I will probably eat these in preferance to rolled oats in the future. The possibility of adding them to soups and other cooked entrees in place of barley or bulgar wheat is a bonus. However, I will probably try a more economical source as I am not convinced that Ireland's soil is superior to that in any other region in which oats are farmed, and metal cans with sharp creases and bent seams don't seem worth the extra cost. …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Great  taste and texture,5,"Absolutely delicious and so easy to prepare! Just add eggs, milk, and vegetable oil. You can use your bread machine if you put it on the ""Quick Bake"" cycle. It comes out of the pan easily and intact with a crusty exterior/moist interior, and maybe just a hint of sweetness. As for the jalapenos, we don't find them to be hot, but they do add a little zest. We usually enjoy this with a nice hot soup on a cold day. …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 Our Cat's Can't Get Enough!,5,"I heard great things about this cat food by word-of-mouth from several people we know, so we decided to try it out. Our cats, without exception, LOVE EVO cat food. We even purchased a small bag of their dry food locally and they loved that too. I must say that we'll be buying this again and with the price of gas these days, Superstore is a great way to order this cat food and other items. Everything shows up on your porch and no need to search anywhere. I did notice a negative review for this product. With cats things can be a big hit or a big miss. If you can buy one can locally to test things out with your feline friends to see how they'll take to it first, it may be best. Or you can buy a small case and if it doesn't work please donate it to a local shelter as I'm sure they'll welcome the assistance. So far, feeding them EVO 95 percent meat, they still love it and ALWAYS show up at dinnertime two months down the road. We've noticed that our cats' fur is softer too, possible a result of the higher protein content of this food. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" BAD, do NOT buy!",1,"Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!! Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling ""corn gluten meal"" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google ""U.S. Patent 5,030,268"" you will find out. By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier. Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price. …",13 out of 33 users found this review helpful

 Alright... maybe 2 1/2 stars,2,"I got this for soap making. I'm a beginner so I can't really say anything about the quality. I received my bottle today with it in solid form. Granted its around 45 degrees outside, so it was most likely becoming a solid. I guess I'll just have to keep it warm to let it go into liquid form. ALSO the biggest complaint I have besides it being in complete solid form is that there's a huge bubble meaning its definitely not a full one quart as advertised. On top of that the bottle seems incredibly cheap. We'll see how the quality is when I start making soap. …",1 out of 30 users found this review helpful
 The Best Chips...PERIOD!,5,"You don't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips. And these chips prove it. The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best. …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 The best bread crumbs...you'll never go back,5,"Panko bread crumbs are just awesome. When used for breading they make a light yet crispy coating...The are different than traditional *american type* crumbs in the way that soft powder snow is different than heavy packed snow. <p>The crumbs themselves are larger and irregularly shaped so as they lie on eachother they don't form a dense compressed breading but one with substance that still remains airy. Their flavor is very light and seasoning is needed but this is a plus for me as I can season to taste.<p>I have also mixed these with traditional bread crumbs at times as these tend to be expensive for a lighter style coating but still essentially very much like all panko dishes. I tend to use a light egg wash with these as I find using just eggs to dip the meat/poulty/fish in a bit heavy for these crumbs. <p>In general I find these far superior for coating food. These aren't the kind of bread crumbs I use for adding bulk (ie meatloaf, meatballs etc). I have been using these for a few years now an there is a huge difference between these and the others. I think if you try them you will really enjoy the light crisp crusts you can achieve... …",27 out of 27 users found this review helpful

 A little secret/new product idea,4,"Previously to receiving this system, hubby and I were attempting to train our 2 young kitties to use a human toilet, to no avail. I learned about this system and decided to give it a try, thinking I'd buy some reusable training pads instead of the ones made for this system (which were more than I wanted to pay). That way we would be able to save some money and the earth a little bit as well. Then, I realized I could potentially skip the pee pads entirely and just replace our toilet training system with the Breeze litter box...on top of the toilet, sans tray (and toilet seat/lid/mounting parts). This is exactly what I did this morning when I received the system, and the kitties were ecstatic not to have to use the wretched toilet training system anymore. They took to it immediately... probably because they were glad to go back to a litter box and also because we had been using Feline Pine with them, so they were used to pellet-type litter. So we're all happy... the kitties are peeing in the toilet, although they don't know it, and all we have to do is scoop the poo, which doesn't smell as bad when the kitties bury it. I was really hoping they would be able to use the toilet on their own, but I think we've reached a pretty good compromise. I did have to cover up part of the grid with some clear mailing tape, however, because the corners of the rectangle grid did not quite fit over the oval toilet bowl. Had to clean up a puddle of piddle after I realized I had miscalculated. :P All that being said, it would be great if a company came out with a Breeze-like system made for toilets. That would be AWESOME... *nudge nudge to the litter companies* …",27 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 Makes a Great Latte - Here's How,5,"I am a Latte fan - Starbucks has been by favorite for years. Lately I've been tired of spending $4 a cup and having to drive to my local shop to get my morning fix so I started to venture into making them with my K-Cups. I've tried out a few different brands and have found that this Big Easy Bold is great. It is strong enough to keep a good flavor after adding my milk and flavorings. Here is how I do it: 1 K-Cup - Emeril's Big Easy Bold 3 ounces of milk 1 tablespoon of cream 1 teaspoon of sugar optional: flavoring of your choice (cinnamon, caramel, chocolate, syrup etc.) In a microwaveable cup (at least 8 ounces)- warm the milk and cream for 30-45 seconds in the microwave on high. In a large mug brew the K-Cup on the espresso setting. Take a battery operated milk frother like Milk Frother, Satin Finish and spin the milk until it is to your liking. Add the teaspoon of sugar to the milk mixture when you have it almost finished. Pour the milk into the mug with the coffee - stir just a tiny bit and you are ready to enjoy. If you choose to add the optional flavoring add it to the coffee before combining it with the milk. Enjoy - you will be surprised that it is actually better than you have had in the store. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Much better than ordinary vanilla,5,"In response to those who say this is no different than typical artificial vanilla, Molina Vanilla actually contains both real Mexican vanilla and artificial vanillin. It's much different than the stuff you'd buy in the supermarket. If you don't believe me, do a side by side taste test.

" Not Peanut Butter, Peanut Flavored Peanut Butter",2,"I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair. The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter? The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again ""regular"" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food. Pros +lower calorie +great price here on Superstore +does taste similar to peanut butter Cons -less nutritional value -doesn't taste like real peanut butter I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else. …",13 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Unbelievable !!!,5,"If you were to imagine the biggest, sweetest, most tender escargot in the universe, you'd still be pleasantly surprised after opening a can of these lovelies and baking them gently. I'm an escargot lover and also a Yankee. The combination of those 2 things has made it hard for me to order escargot in a restaurant. I have on occasion, but $10. for 6 tiny, albeit tasty morsels has caused minor pangs in my Yankee heart. Add to that the trend in the US for more casual dining and even finding escargot on the menu now is less likely than it was 10 years ago. So, not a big deal. Life goes on...no snails for Jo Ana. Until now. I was doing some grocery shopping on Superstore the other day and discovered the Subscribe and Save program.

I'm not a big eater, but 6 of these with a small vegetable portion is dinner for me. I bake them with organic extra virgin coconut oil heavily laced with garlic and WOW !

 Lecithin and Cayenne,5,"All you you have to do is search the web for Lecithin and Cayenne. Lecithin is a natural emulsifier that suspends fat in your bloodstream instead of on your arterial walls. Cayenne is a vasodilator that lowers blood-pressure and increases blood-flow. This unique combination both lowers cholesterol and reduces blood-pressure plus it reduces plaque on arterial walls. There is no excuse not to try this homeopathic remedy. Personally, I take one cup of hot water with one dropper-full of cayenne tincture (homemade) and one tablespoon of lecithin with one teaspoon of granulated garlic per day. I don't take any statins whatsoever; nor, do I take the hypertension drugs at the high-dosages I used to. My blood-pressure and cholesterol are both within the safe ranges. As a replacement for the statins, I take presciptions fish oil (Lovaza) and niacin (Niaspan) daily as medications. Comment if you want to know how I make my cayenne tincture.

 This natural food works ... a genuine SUPERFOOD,5,"Given the lack of response to some key criticisms, though relatively few, of this food, I'll focus my review on why this nutritional powerhouse is classified as a SUPERfood and why, for what are obvious reasons, some folks do not like this awesome Organic Raw Maca. Maca is surely classified as a superfood, and why that is the case pertains to its exceptional potency. General speaking, the ""better"" a superfood tastes, the lower (that's right, the lower) the nutritional density. And why would this be the case? Well, simply because the most nutritionally dense superfoods -- such as Maca, chlorella, spirulina, broccoli sprouts, etc. -- often have very strong tastes that seem unusual to people used to drinking sugary beverages like sodas, processed fruit juices, etc. Fortunately, since it's abundantly obvious to me that not everything that's good for me is going to taste like a Ritter Sport chocolate bar, I've been able to get past the subjective definitions or pronouncements on Maca's taste or flavor -- and most reviews by far out there, by the way, indicate a much more neutral, even positive assessment of Maca's taste. I for one, like so many Americans, want really good and sustainable energy, not the kind that comes at any kind of unnatural price, e.g., sudden crashes, nervousness, the jitters, stomach aches, headaches, cramps, etc. Fortunately through Maca, I've found significantly increased energy, overall alertness, focus, and enhanced powers of concentration....not to mention the physical energy for my lengthy & strenuous workouts. Though I jus' luvs me my coffee, there are numerous ways of getting that energy without the price of the smaller dives, total crashes and inevitable burn-outs. If this entirely natural, special Maca-kind-of-boost is not important to you, then you don't need to try it. Having communicated all this, careful readers of all of the reviews here will probably be able to see why some do not like Organic Raw Maca Powder, often linked to questions about taste, culinary expectations, etc. To note, it's difficult for me to place much weight on reviews by those who have tried out a food (and I view Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Maca Powder, not as a product, but as an exceptional nutritional food) for only a few days (only 3!, in some instances) or a few weeks. Generally speaking, the better a superfood tastes, the lower the nutritional density, and this is because the most nutritionally dense superfoods -- such as wheat grass, spinach, barley grass, chlorella, spirulina, green tea (extract), broccoli sprouts, etc. -- often have very strong tastes that seem unusual to people used to drinking sugary beverages like sodas or processed fruit juices. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Product not as described,3,"Package arrived in time. I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery.

I'm a very fussy coffee drinker - too weak = bla; too strong = bitter and undrinkable. Tully's coffee as a rule is a little stronger then the GM brand, overall. Typically 'House' blends don't mean a whole lot to me, but this one is exceptional. Not bitter, not watery, wonderful aroma. The only other decaf brand I would ever recommend is Emeril's. All the other brands are too weak for me. My husband can only drink decaf and we tried every, single brand when we were switching from ground coffee to the K-cup. This is the only one he liked - and he doesn't like strong coffee and I don't like weak coffee - WE BOTH LOVE THIS ONE!

 Not Raw Almond Butter,1,"If the government says you can lie, then it's okay to lie? California almonds are not raw except for a few loopholes, so why is this company saying these are raw when they're not? Because the USDA says they can! Trader Joe's uses the same ""legal lie"" about their almonds and almond butters but that doesn't make it right. Artisana, the manufacturer says the process of making the butter only reaches 115 degrees but they leave out the part about the almonds are already partially cooked. You can buy truly raw almond butter from unpasteurized organic almonds but this isn't it. ""California almonds"" is the giveaway.

" Fantastic Coffee, BUT...",4,"BEST INSTANT, PERIOD! BUT... I can't drink VIA made according to it's instructions. It's just way, WAY, too strong. (I'm talking seriously stronger than what you get at a local Starbucks.) Let me explain. When I make brewed coffee, I freshly grind beans to a very fine texture, using two or three tablespoons of grounds per 6 ounces of water. So I'm used to a strong cup of coffee. Since one packet of VIA makes even a large mug of water into an un-drinkablly strong brew, I use only half a packet. The problem is, a couple hours later, the left-over half becomes an unusable blob that won't come out of the packet. No great loss... I've had a GREAT cup of coffee, and I can just toss the other half packet, right? Well, acutally, that's a problem for me. I'm of the 'clean your plate / starving kids in Biafra' generation. I would prefer a smaller packet at a smaller price. So one star off from someone who was taught 'waste not, want not' and is too old to change ;-) …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" IF you like this, just try tasty east Soy Jerky",1,"First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And, we found out it has granulated garlic, possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to ""spices"". Here it is part of the ""vegetarian spices"" ingredient. The company does not seem very forthcoming. Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available. Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them. This tasty eats soy jerky is the best tasting and what more, no onion or garlic powder in any of their product line. They are rated 5 of 5.

 Beware...,1,"My wife and I have purchased J. LeBlanc Champagne vinegar from other suppliers on the net and become great fans of it. So, when my usual supplier had no stock, I ordered the product from Touch of Europe, who were a dollar or so more expensive, but who had stock. When the vinegar arrived, it was not the white wine colour of previous bottles I had bought, but brown - rather like cider vinegar. The taste was awful - not at all what we had gotten to expect. So I returned it to Touch of Europe, saying that, based on my experience with this vinegar, their product tasted bad and was probably ""off"". To cut a long complaining consumer saga short, the company has continued to insist that there is nothing wrong with the product they supplied. (Whatever happened to ""the customer is always right""?). And the bottom line, after multiple e-mails and phone calls, is that they have now agreed to refund me - but I have to bear the shipping costs of the return, which was around $8.95. I have previously found the J. LeBlanc Champagne vinegar to be an excellent product. The product supplied by Touch of Europe was unacceptable, and when I returned it, I was not dealt with the way customers ought to be treated. …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" Great in the tall can, horrible in these small ones--edited review: don't buy these cans, get 17.5 oz ones!",5,"Please see update at the end of this review. For fairness sake, I'm leaving original review I did when I tried the 17.5 oz cans intact. But the smaller cans do not contain the same quality product. Whether bad batch (one time) or just bad distributor/supplier for small cans (ongoing), I'd beware. Now, the original review, then the updates: This is far and away my fave coconut water now that I'm self-exiled from the horror that is new Zico (they ruined a terrific product by making it from concentrate). Note that this comes in cans, not tetra paks, and the cans are BPA-free. These are recyclable (well, as long as your area accepts cans.) Note as well that Amy & Brian's coconut waters are flash-pasteurized (like ONE and Zico and others). Unless you wanna risk crazy bacteria, coconut water must have some sort of pasteurization. I've been sampling various Superstore-available coconut waters looking for my new staple. History: I was a loyal Zico subscriber/drinker for a couple years. They changed. It's awful. I canceled my subscription. I've had and enjoyed O.N.E. in the tetra pak and Nature Factor's organic in a can. I've had and not liked as much VitaCoco and Harvest Bay. But all those are fine depending on your own taste preferences. Previously, I had also tried supermarket brands like Goya and Conchita. I'm always willing to try coconut water, looking for good price and great taste. I decided to try Amy & Brian's cause I learned about them from googling ""coconut water taste tests"" due to wanting to see what others thought of the brands out there. One taste test comparison mentioned this one tasted most like the actual coconut that was used in the taste test for comparison. Another taste test gave A&B props, too. So, yeah, got my attention. This one is now my new fave. I have subscribed to the A&B pulp free in both can sizes. Second fave based on flavor alone (not processing, container, etc) is Nature Factor's organic one. After that O.N.E. VitaCoco is good for those who prefer less sweetness, more of a slightly sourness. Something out there for everyone, right? I can say this to coconut water lovers: those above are definitely worth trying to see if you enjoy them, too, before you decide on a permanent subscription. But do try this one if you enjoy a bit more sweetness. So good. But if you hate any sort of higher sense of sweetness in your beverages, this isn't for you. I'd recommend ONE or Vitacoco for you, or maybe Harvest Bay. What makes this one a bit different than the good brands I've named: Big can option or small can option: 17.5 ounces vs this one that's 10 ouncnes. I buy both now, cause some days I want the bigger can to take with me to Pilates. Sweeter: Maybe it's where they get their coconuts from, but this brand has a delicious sweetness that is lacking on ONE, VitaCoco, Zico (old and new), and Harvest Bay. Nature Factor's is a bit sweeter than the previous, but Amy and Brian beats them all. I like sweet. :D Because another reviewer called it ""unnaturally sweet"", I emailed Amy & Brian via their website to ask if this is from concentrate or has sugar added or manipulated. I was told it's juice as it came from the coconuts, not from concentrate, no sugar added. So, I'm content. Some facts: 8 oz = 76 calories This is more than ounce per ounce for other brands, but this is probably explained by the sweetness (meaning more natural carbs). Worth noting for those who are on low-carb/carb-conscious diets. For the rest, it just means MORE FLAVOR. I wish Amy & Brian would put the potassium count on the label, though. This matters to a lot of us, including those who need to watch K intake due to drugs that spare potassium or folks who have high blood pressure and want to see how much K in their diet controls it. To the manufacturer: PLEASE add potassium to labeling under the sodium. Thanks. I love, love that Superstore offers this on subcribe and save. Makes life easier. Thank you, Superstore, for this wonderful addition to your S&S coconut water offerings. Enjoy and be healthy! Update: I emailed Amy & Brian after I posted this review, and lo and behold, they will be adding Potassium and Magnesium to their labels. FYI, here are the counts: Potassium: whole can: 780, 8 oz serving: 360 Magnesium: whole can: 31.2, 8 oz servinng: 14.4 I confirmed that A&B is ""flash pasteurized"", and got email from them to prove it, which is the same pasteurization used for the tetra paks, as I understand it, so the nutrients should be comparable. They heat their at a lower temp than, say, Zico's, but for a bit longer. If you google ""Crossfit Adventure"" and this coconut water brand name, you'll see the article about the specifics: A&B heats their juice to 160-165 degrees for 15-20 seconds so that the nutrient content is undiminished. Also, the can is not BPA - it is Aqualure 900~19%. The other brand I liked the taste of, Nature Factor, does heat up their CW to a very high degree, so that one may be of concern nutrients-wise. Not A&B. They use Thai coconuts. :) Addendum: For carb watchers-- The carb count for A&B is roughly twice that of others. I used the brands I had at hand at home (and a calculator) to save you time making comparisons. The number stands for carbs per ounce: Amy & Brian: 2.375 Nature Factor Organic: 1.6 O.N.E.: 1.33 New Zico (from concentrate): 1.07 I think Old Zico was more like ONE in terms of carbs per ounce. I wonder if the selection of coconuts can give higher sodium (see new Zico's much higher sodium count), then can the selection also be chosen to have higher carbs/more sweetness? HTH UPDATE: WHOA! Talk about variety. I have to say that my second order of Amy & Brian's is not as nice-tasting as the first. My first batch was really delicious and natural tasting. The second order tastes like candy-water. Seriously, it has an unnaturally sweet, unusual flavor. It's still not as offputting as the sour/cereal taste of the bottled Zico, but it's not something I'd recommend. So, a warning--you might get a great batch or a not so great one. But I thought you needed to know that flavor is not consistent (and it wasn't with original Zico, the one I used to drink the most, as coconuts will differ, coconut from coconut, therefore coconut water will have certain inconsistencies unless it's ""jiggered"" for consistency.) I hope, if you ordered, your batch is wonderful. But I am reconsidering my subscription, cause this variation is just a bit too disparate (a little change is fine, but from amazing to odd-sugary-candy-water will not do.) I have to amend my rating to three stars. HTH. Update July 12, 2010: Okay, I couldn't resist the sale this month that gives me A&B for half off, so I ordered the large/tall can in the pulp version. FANTASTIC. It seems that every case I've gotten in the Tall cans is great. All the cases in the small cans are horrible. So, take my advice: skip these 10 oz cans and get the tall version of A&B, either with or without pulp. Delicious. A&B needs to research why those small cans are so bad versus the tasty and coconutty tall ones. …",40 out of 42 users found this review helpful
 Wonderful,5,"I was reluctant to try this out, because I've had so many terrible jarred pasta sauces and no one had reviewed this product yet, but my fears were quickly put to rest. This is the BEST jarred pasta sauce I've ever had. Actually, it's probably the best pasta sauce I've ever had prepared by someone else, period. Only a super-fresh homemade sauce, made with wonderful ingredients (San Marzano tomatoes, roasted onions and garlic, etc.) can compete. Considering that such a sauce really takes hours to make, all told, I'm thrilled to use this instead. This flavor in particular is an excellent base to use for other sauces - it won't overpower the other ingredients you add, but it has such a fantastic flavor it can easily be used on its own. One of my favorite things to do is use a half-a-jar of this sauce over organic prepared ravioli - it's a super-quick, somewhat healthy meal that tastes amazing. The heat from the freshly boiled ravioli is sufficient to warm up the sauce, so there's no need to even cook the sauce separately - you just pour it on and you're done! The jars are very nice, thick, reusable polypropylene (#5). I use them to bring my lunch to work everyday - it's pretty surprising how nice they are - they are definitely not disposable junk. There are some reports of an occasional jar arriving broken if this item is shipped via ground, which is honestly hard for me to imagine. I use Superstore Prime, so mine arrive via two-day, and the packaging is always flawless. To address this problem, Superstore had a ""Pasta Lovers Gift Set"" from this company with extra packaging, but it doesn't appear to show up in searches anymore. It contained four flavors - Marinara, Arrabbiata, Tuscan Vodka, and Barely Bolognese, if I remember correctly. All delicious - the Arrabbiata is fairly spicy, though. Anyway, buy this sauce! The more people buy it, the more wonderful flavors Superstore will presumably carry. One final note - this is a GREAT DEAL for these sauces. If you don't believe me, take a look elsewhere on the web for this company's sauces - five bucks a jar is an absolute steal for an all-natural product of this top-notch quality. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Great for vines and small trees,5,"Had vines that were taking over. They were creeping / had buried roots growing horizontally, which can complicate killing them. To get rid of them, I cut the upward=growing vines about half a foot above the ground. I did this so that if I had to apply the product again, I would have enough vine remaining to cut again. Sometimes if the vine (or root or base of tree or shrub) is really thick, it can take more than one application. (It's best to apply the product to a fresh cut.) In order to apply it twice or three times, you want to leave enough length so that you can make the cut again. This stuff is strong, so don't get me wrong. But, for really large diameters, leave yourself some extra in case you have to come back. I've used this on oak trees too. Just cut the sapling down to size and spritz the stub. If anything grows back, you can spray the leaves or make a fresh cut. Eventually when enough of the root is destroyed, it will not grow back. Great product. Would buy again. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical,1,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands. This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi. Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering. The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much. While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal. Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products. Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money). Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer. One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer. Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail *Concentrate Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99 Liters of product per container 12 Flavor/l $0.42 *Carbonator Volume of CO2 130 Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99 CO2 cost per liter $0.23 *Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter Equipment cost $89.00 Equipment life (years) 5 Discount rate (cost of money) 8% Liters per month 10.00 Monthly amortized cost $1.80 Cost of equipment per liter $0.18 *Water Cost with Brita Filtration Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004 Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95 Brita cost per liter $0.0373 Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377 (assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration) ***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2 SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73 Without filtered water: SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65 *****What does CO2 Really Cost???? THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW *Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit) weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2 cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35 CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams *Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation losses: 10% available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85% net accessible CO2 of total: 77% usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams *Output carbonated liters of water: 2,479 cost per liter in USD$: $0.014 *SodaStream Output SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product) Cost per refill: $30.00 cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231 *SodaStream Markup Economics ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534% math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing This is an incredible 1500% markup Pros Saves plastic Allows flexible mixture of flavors Cons Cost of output is not compelling Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit ***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

" Great shelf life, very good for general use",4,"I use this product frequently. Like most tofu, you need to press it (between paper towels with a heavy skillet on top works fine) to get the excess water out. The more water you can remove, the less you'll have to deal with sloppiness when cooking, something the previous reviewer did not like. As for a blank slate on taste, that's exactly what makes tofu great. It will take on any flavor you want to impart. Our most common marinade is placing the pressed, cubed tofu in a Ziploc with a mix of soy, honey, and lemon or lime juice. A quick search online for a marinade will give you ideas (many also include minced garlic, ginger, etc). You can also purchase a premade marinade, like a teriyaki sauce. The more liquid the marinade (and the more water removed from pressing), the better it will penetrate the tofu. Even a half hour in the bag works fine. We saute it right in the pan with the stir fry veggies (add tofu last--it just needs to get warm; or, for a firmer style, you can bake or ""brown"" it separately first) and pour in the remaining marinade as the final sauce (you can thicken with cornstarch if desired). Handle the tofu cubes gently as they are not firm like most meats, but broken up pieces taste just fine too. Marinated tofu cubes also do well on kebabs with veggies on the grill. Plain tofu ""creams"" well and is often good in a dish that requires thickness. We've made chocolate mousse with it as well as scrambling it like eggs. We have great success breading pressed cubes of this tofu just like you would the chicken in a General Tso recipe. General Tso's Tofu is AWESOME. The flavor comes from the sauce so you don't need to marinate first. Some people also freeze tofu--generally remove from packaging and press first--to give it a firmer consistency. Tofu is all about how you prepare it. Most people will NOT like it plain, so don't expect to just dig a fork into it. This particluar product is great because of its all-purpose nature (firm is definitely better than soft for saute, etc) and its shelf life. I would have given it five stars but the must-be-refrigerated versions packaged in fluid do seem to be firmer. They don't last as long in the house, though, so this is a perfect choice to keep in the pantry (usually dated a few to several months out). …",27 out of 29 users found this review helpful

 Impressive Customer Service,5,"During shipment, the lid detached, leaking the contents of the starter culture. Contacted the seller who immediately responded. Received a personal note stating they would replace the item, that they had identified the container flaw, and had already implemented a new process to ensure it wouldn't happen again in the future. Later the same day, was surprised to receive an email that they had additinally credited my account $10 for delay in receiving (based on original order date, not replacement date). Very impressed.

 The bread you can actually enjoy!,5,"This bread mix really is ""homemade wonderful""!! After so many disappointing frozen loaves of gluten free bread, I decided to try to make some at home. I took a chance on this product and I am so glad I did. It doesn't seem like it will work out as you are mixing up ~ it seems like batter bread rather than a traditional yeast bread. Just follow the directions on the package and you won't be let down. Remember to remove the loaf from the pan as soon as it is done or else the bottom of the loaf will get soggy. (cool it on a rack) I found out that this bread doesn't store well for me. It gets stale/moldy very quickly (due to the fact there are no preservatives). I slice up the whole cooled loaf and freeze it, defrosting slices as I need them. Then you can enjoy the whole thing without waste. …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Tasty but with a big drawback,2,"Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot. Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!! Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Superstore product description. Ouch! So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter. Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten. That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past. However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is ""imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources. We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west."" All that said, taste is pretty good and the ""wet"" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer). …",10 out of 13 users found this review helpful

" Convenient, Healthy, and Tastes Great",5,"Chicken of the Sea Premium Wild-Caught Pink Salmon, 2.6oz pouches are a very convenient method of eating on the run or preparing a quick meal when time is short. I recently began using Salmon in the pouch and really like how convenient it is to use and it taste great. The pouch is very easy to open just by tearing the top of the pouch which has a pre-made notch to initiate an easy opening. Once the pouch is open it is not resealable. The Salmon can be eaten directly out of the pouch or you can empty the contents to make a salad or other meal. I now keep some of these Salmon pouches at work and I carry a few in my every day carry (EDC) bag in case I get stuck somewhere and need a quick, easy, and healthy snack to keep me going. I also carry some when hiking, backpacking, or camping. The pouch is relatively strong and would not easily be punctured by an object. As a precaution I do wrap the pouch in a one gallon freezer bag when carrying the Salmon in my EDC bag just as an added measure of caution. Each pouch is considered one portion and contains 70 calories with 20 calories from fat. Each serving contains 13 grams of protein. The pouch has a label stating that the product is skinless and boneless. This Salmon is a good source of protein and Omega-3 fatty acids. The Salmon is labeled as a product of Thailand and the expiration date is over 2 years from that date that I purchased the Salmon so it will last awhile and there is no need to be concerned about the expiration date. I have seen this product on sale at a local grocery store for under a dollar which is a great deal. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend Chicken of the Sea Premium Wild-Caught Pink Salmon Pouch to others. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

I used to feel this price was ridiculous but now, after four months without CLC, it is most certainly fair, and can be delivered overnight by air for you prime members. The prime is an end in itself, to have things delivered in two days for free: that is a lot of products that can make their way to you. It is the world's largest grocery store and bookstore. Everything--the world in all its muchness--is yours for the ordering. I love all of it, the world, these reviews, Superstore and its slightly salacious/campy name, Superstore prime, the website, the other reviewers who gave it five stars, and their children.

 Hubby's Best Friends,4,"As a married man, I'm constantly in a state of conflict. Left to my own devices, I'm perfectly content to shovel food, guzzle beer, emit various gasses and generally befoul my surroundings like the coothless savage half-shaven chimp I am. But with the missus around, I'm compelled to be on my best behavior -- for the next forty to sixty years. Or until I drop dead of an aneurysm from trying to remember which fork to eat salad with, or which indistinguishable shade of white I'm supposed to paint the bathroom. Clearly, I need some help. Nothing says ""love"" like ""Honey, I'm sorry I'm a slack-jawed Neanderthal with the social graces of a lobotomized hyena."" And nothing says ""I'm sorry"" better than roses. Lots and lots and lots of roses. So I figure, screw it. It's too hard acting civilized, trying to look sharp and walking the straight, narrow and uncomfortable path that leads to Miss Manners' cottage. The lessons are unlikely to stick, anyway, so I might as well get on with my filthy heathen life and apologize with flowers when I step out of line. With lots. And lots. And LOTS of flowers. Yeah, it could get a tad expensive. But if the alternative is 'fork classes' and learning the difference between eggshell and ecru, then color me rosy.

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",18 out of 24 users found this review helpful
" Outstanding, Bold, Lively Sumatran. best of the K-cups",5,"First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine. Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being ""tangy"" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich. IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4. I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc. Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star. Stale and bitter. I will definitely stay with Puck's. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Good but not great quality,3,"After visiting a local chocolate factory, I was interested in incorporating cacao into my diet for health benefits. I like to put a tablespoon into my morning cereal. This is my second time purchasing cacao nibs through Superstore, and although the price was right, the quality of nibs was not as good as the first, which cost almost twice as much. The nibs taste and smell the same, but there is a bloom (white film) on them. As I understand it, this is caused by not storing them under ideal conditions. You can kind of see it in the picture for this product. The other brand was a richer brown color. The bloom does not affect the taste but makes them look less appealing and leaves a film (cocoa butter, I think) on the glass jar in which I store these nibs. There are also some shell fragments to watch out for.

 Picky dog LOVES this and it's PERFECT nutrition!,5,"Our lab is a picky eater to the point that she was about 10% underweight just eating barely enough to keep her alive. That was on Lg Breed Puppy Eukanuba (sp?). Then, I ignorantly switched her to Purina Puppy Chow before I knew how bad corn is for dogs, the number one ingredient of that awful formula. She didn't really like that, either, thankfully. Then, I switched her to Large Breed Puppy EVO. She liked that a bit better, and it didn't have corn. But, I still had to put a bit of hot water on it and essentially drag her to the bowl. She did gain weight, though. Then, EUREKA, we found Taste of the Wild. NO GRAIN!! All the nutrition she needs - I think she eats better than we do with this stuff. I guessed that being a bird dog she'd like the Roasted Fowl flavor. I opened the bag in the store and she wolfed it down like nothing else I'd ever seen. Since then she's eaten the amount of food she's supposed to for her age and weight with no water added or cajoling into into eating. Granted, she's still not a huge eater, but by the end of the day her allotment is eaten. Her weight is perfect, and she really does like the food. I'm glad I don't have to add water so her teeth stay clean - it's nice and crunchy. Her coat is gorgeous and her muscles rippling (we exercise her a lot). She's got an amazing physique, and her dry skin/dandruff seems to be markedly reduced. Taste of the Wild is worth every penny, and I believe in my heart that she'll live a longer, healthier life (possibly years longer) for our having found it. Thank God for Taste of the Wild.

 Diabetic who loves Dreamfields.,5,"Who better than a diabetic to vouch for this product? Unlike most low-carbohydrate dieters, I test my blood sugar at least four times a day. I know how foods affect me. I have very tight control on my blood sugar; my readings are very predictable. Because of that, I know when foods have hidden carbohydrates in them. I experimented last year with Dreamfields. I paired one serving size of the spaghetti with an olive oil and garlic sauce and topped the dish with some Parmesan cheese. Because some diabetics complain of delayed spikes, I tested every hour for four hours just to make sure. Pre-meal: 69; 1 Hour: 62; 2 Hour: 73; 3 Hour: 82; 4 Hour: 69. As you can see, I returned to pre-meal levels by four hours and my third-hour reading was the highest, but the number wasn't high in itself. I have since eaten Dreamfields on two other occasions with similar results. I think the key is restricting your portion size to that listed on the box. Cook al dente, as overcooking can weaken the protective coating that blocks the carbohydrates. Be mindful of the sauces you're using. Jarred tomato sauce is just full of sugar. I buy a jarred Alfredo that only has 1 gram of carbohydrates per serving. Pesto and olive-oil sauces are good options, too. Add a protein to your dish; that helps. As far as taste goes: amazing. Tastes exactly like real pasta. No one in my family knew that it wasn't the 'real' stuff. I love that Dreamfields makes more than just spaghetti. I actually got to enjoy macaroni salad at my last family gathering thanks to Dreamfields. …",34 out of 34 users found this review helpful

In the morning(especially during the warm season), I enjoy making a cold/ice coffee with a 50/50 mix of Silk brand Chocolate Soy milk (light) and water. Very refreshing.

 Is it Rapadura?,3,"This review is some research about whether or not this product is actually rapadura. Although this product is indexed under ""rapadura,"" which is a Portuguese name for dried sugar cane juice, this company (Rapunzel) used to sell a product that is specifically labeled ""Rapadura"" (see below; also Google ""rapadura"" for more info). In researching whole cane sugar, brown sugar, and sugarcane, etc., on Wikipedia, ""rapadura"" is the name used in Brazil, Argentina, some other South and Latin American countries and the Caribbean, whereas ""panela"" is used in Columbia, ""piloncillo"" is used in Mexico, and ""jaggery"" is used in India for what appears to be identical products--unrefined, dried, natural sugar from sugar cane, minimally processed, with all the natural vitamins and minerals still intact. From the pictures I've seen on Wikipedia and other websites, ""organic cane sugar"" is quite a bit lighter in color than rapadura, panela, jaggery, etc., suggesting that is has be refined to some degree, like adding calcium carbonate to remove some so-called impurities. From Wikipedia entry for ""Rapadura:"" ""Despite the fact that rapadura is a very old foodstuff, predating even the colonization of Brazil, a German company called Rapunzel has registered the name as a German trade mark DE 1143537, an event that has greatly angered Brazilians, as they see the name as a generic all-purpose word, like 'lemonade' or 'sandwich'.... As of February 2009, Rapunzel has removed the Rapadura name from their unrefined and unbleached whole cane sugar product sold in health food stores, though their website has not yet been updated to reflect this."" …",22 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Crispy Ginger Cookies,5,These are the best gluten free ginger cookies I have tried. They have a snappy ginger flavor and are very crispy.

 Great snack....even during battle!!,5,"I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Superstore). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it. For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product. If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it! …",51 out of 59 users found this review helpful

 NOT CRUNCHY,1,"Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months. They are heat sensitive. As the packaging states ""IMPORTANT- STORE IN COOL DRY AREA"". The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together. They probably cooked during shipping and are not a ""Raw Food"" and not as ""Nutritious"" anymore. Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened. Superstore does not accept grocery returns. It was a waste of $40. …",21 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Target and BJs carries it cheaper,3,"I recently started supplementing with Similac Advance and find its taste matches the closest with breastmilk. My baby hated Enfamil/Gerber. However, I found BJs carries this a lot cheaper at $28 for a 34 oz can compared to $40 per can here. The price difference is HUGE and not sure why someone would buy this from here. Even target carries the formula a lot cheaper. Superstore seems to have missed the price competitiveness on such a widely used product. …",17 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 Pregnant wife loves them,5,"So last week my lovely and pregnant wife was eating a bowl of Lucky Charms cereal and made some comment in passing about how she wished she could have a bowl of just the marshmallows. I quickly did a search and somebody suggested I check Superstore for ""Dehydrated Marshmallows"". A few minutes later I found and ordered these. Three days later a box arrived via USPS. I told my wife it was a gift for her. She absolutely LOVES them. I have scored ""a months worth of brownie points"". They are exactly what she was hoping for.

 Caribou Pulls a Fast One on Loyal Customers,1,"I've been drinking Caribou Blend for years and it is just right for my taste... or at least it was. Got a new shipment in and I noticed a color change on the K-cup, orange to light green. Uh-oh, wrong product? I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change. My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad. I would have gladly paid more for my favorite. The new blend is far inferior. If you're a regular, have someone brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference. Time for a new favorite with a company that doesn't play sleazy tricks on its loyal customers. If and when prices return to normal, watch the return to the old orange based on ""we listen to our customers"" and more corporate-speak BS. …",21 out of 24 users found this review helpful

" Good product, but...",4,"I've yet to find any of the dogs I know that love it. I still have my allergic dog eating it, but she has to be hungry to eat this without doctoring. My vet doesn't want me feeding her people food so I add some of Newman's or Happy Hips canned to it. I've talked to a couple of vets about prescription diet and they all push the big company brand names. The common objection appears to be the soy used in Newman's to increase the protein count. I am willing to put a little flavor in this to feed may dog high quality, social responsible food. I may be the only person who has made the following mistake but, assuming you catch the Superstore sales, make sure you are ordering the bag size you want. I thought I was getting a good price on one order until the food came and it was the seven instead of twelve pound bag. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Be Careful With Your Order,2,"Since this is a sale price, I assumed it was for the 30 lb bag. My bad, as I ordered the product and then emailed to verify. Turns out it's for their smaller bags. There's a good chance you can buy the same product for a lot cheaper at your local pet store.

 What this stuff really tastes like...,5,"I love bonito flakes. I'll tell you why - they taste like bacon to me. There is no religious reason for me NOT to eat bacon; however, these give you that smokey flavor of bacon without the fakey smoked tasted of turkey bacon or just that liquid smoke stuff. I love bacon, I love bonito flakes and have become addicted to dashi, the basic Japanese broth they use in almost everything. It's much more natural, it's delicious, it's not like anything else.

 improved freshness!!,5,"Original review: This is a good quality product and a great value, but the bag I got was a little stale. When I open the packages of other brands, I get a noseful of fresh peppermint aroma and that is missing here. Davidson needs to use more sophisticated packaging to keep it fresh. How about something similar to the bags coffee comes in, instead of a paper bag with a folded over top? Update April 2011: Davidson's has upgraded their packaging to a zip-top bag with a foil barrier, and the difference is amazing: intense peppermint aroma and rich flavor. Excellent. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Great value and taste,5,"When you go through K-cups like I do, this large quantity purchase is perfect. Hazelnut is always a favorite and this particular brand holds up to a generous cup serving. Some brands get too watered down in a large mug, but this has body enough to take it. Since I store my K-cups in a drawer, it doesn't matter that the shipping box is a bare bones container. I just appreciate the value. All in all, it's a great way to buy K-cups in quantity. Highly recommended. …",49 out of 49 users found this review helpful

 The only toy that won't be immediately destroyed,4,"I never liked nylabones before I got them for my dogs. They always seemed dirty, hair sticks to the ends after they've been chewed and dogs will make their gums bleed chewing them. But my dogs make quick work of any chewy (they finish even very large edible chewies in less than one minute), so we got the durable nylabones and the dogs love to chew them. They are not indestructable but they last for months even with daily use. The dogs do make their gums bleed chewing them at first but I was surprised to see how clean their teeth are now. A good thing to have for a serious chewer. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Delicious and addicting and healthy snack food!,5,"I'm really impressed by these corn thins.....when the huge box of them arrived, I was dismayed at first thinking, what have I done here?! How will I ever eat these?! But now that I've started munching them, I don't think that's going to be a problem! These are delicious. Unlike rice cakes, which they resemble, they are much denser so they don't crumble apart when you eat them. You can actually use them as you would a piece of bread. In a sort of sandwich capacity. Terrific with cheese or nut butters. But there is something addicting about them, it's very easy to start chomping away at them as it they are potato chips. IF you can control yourself, they are relatively low in calories. I'm really pleased with this purchase, I was looking for something to rotate my grains,,,and this was a good choice. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
