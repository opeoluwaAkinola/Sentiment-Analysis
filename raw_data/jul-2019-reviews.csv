 Beware the difference between Caramel and Classic Caramel,1,"I have been round and round a bit on this. This item and UPC are for the CLASSIC Caramel flavor from Torani. It is terrible. Don't get this confused with the regular/plain Caramel flavor from Torani, which is fabulous. Make sure you note they are DIFFERENT products. Superstore created this Classic Caramel page based on the Caramel page, then renamed the old page to Classic Caramel as well, which is a confusing mess. You need to ignore the reviews on the other page as they are for a different product. The UPC 089036241397 is for Classic Caramel. The UPC 089036241434 is for regular Caramel. Superstore, incorrectly, kept references to Caramel on this page. It is not! The taste difference between the two is shocking. This one tastes like turpentine-soaked shoe leather. In fact, I spit out my first cafe lattes based on this thinking it was spoiled/rotten. Finally, note that Superstore does not allow returns of grocery items, so be sure you like CLASSIC Caramel before you are stuck with 3 bottles of the stuff. …",36 out of 38 users found this review helpful

 Great Cereal,4,"If you are looking for a healthy, good tasting cereal you should try Kashi's GOLEAN Crunch. Compared to most healthy (particularly high protein and high fiber) cereals, it has a higher protein and fiber content per serving. As important, it tastes good. Its taste obviously cannot compare to some sugar filled normal cereal, but as health cereals go, this one is a keeper. I eat it 3-4 days a week and have done so for over a year and I still like it! Just note that you may want to buy one box from your local grocery store before buying a six pack from Superstore just to make sure you like it. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
" Against all logic, it's a whole shark! What craftmanship",5,"The sharkbanana is an amazing piece of work. While, as you'd expect, the shark is stitched inside the banana, I can tell you, from personal experience, that if you manage to play with your Sharkbanana too hard and the stitching rips out, you too might be shocked to find, THERE IS A WHOLE SHARK PLUSHIE IN THERE. That is what I call attention to detail. So rather than being, as some might describe it, half-shark, half-banana, it's actually whole-shark, whole-banana [peel]. And each piece is fun. Protip: insert a shot glass into the stuffed banana peel and fill it with banana-infused rum for a truly surreal experience. Just don't slip on the peel or get attacked by the shark. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" Great alkaline water, 9.5pH",5,"Got a bottle of this at my local Whole Foods market to try. It has a silky taste as it advertises and it is a great starting water for people -like me- who want to see if alkaline water can make a difference in how they feel and with stomach acidity. I liked it so much, I got a case from Superstore, delivered 2-days later with my Prime account (I love it!). I am slowly going through the case, one bottle every other day, sometimes everyday. I have to say that I have noticed a stamina related improvement but I will have to watch this for more days. I was away for 5 days not drinking it and my stamina was hampered so that is an experiment I can believe, but I need more proof. Tha page says bottles are BPA free but the label on the bottle has no such remark so I am not sure which is true. The price for the 12-case was just $20 when I bought them a few weeks ago, but now I see that Superstore has increased the pricing to $25. I will check with my local Whole Foods market and if price is lower for a case there, will not buy from Superstore the next time around -sorry Superstore. If you are now starting to get interested in an alkaline diet for improving your health, this is a great introduction along with several books on reducing the acidity of food intake and stomach environment for all of us with GERD, like Acid: The Reflux Diet Cookbook & Cure which I also purchased. …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" Nice mix, but..",3,"I was looking for a mix like McCormicks Medley blend which has the 4 types of peppercorns, coriander and allspice. This was the closest I could find, minus the allspice. This blend has great flavor. The only problem is the coriander is so large that it's hard to get into the grinder and the grinder gets plugged up, having to reverse grind. I do have a very nice William Bounds grinder, so it's not the grinders fault. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Blk y2k,5,"I randomly was driving to the airport and started to feel awful. My stomach hurt and I felt nauseated.I stopped at the gas station and weirdly picked this out of the cooler. I drank two big gulps of it and noticed it has a unique, waxy quality. It sort of reminded me of burnt paper, in a good way? Whatever that means. About 1 minute went by and my stomach seriously ceased hurting. My friend googled it and it has some crazy minerals in it. After drinking the whole bottle, I feel super refreshed. I guess it's true that your body really knows what it needs. Would be good for hangovers, I'd imagine. …",1 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GREAT THESE GINGER SNAPS ARE,5,"Six ingredients...Dates,Almonds,Pecans,Ginger,Cinnamon, and Cloves....that's it....I don't know how they do it but it is the most delicious treat i've had in a long time The ginger, cinnamon and cloves give off a pungent aroma and packs a punch-the dates give it a sweetness but not too sweet and the nuts add crunchiness but WOW!WOW!WOW!

 What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical,1,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands. This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi. Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering. The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much. While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal. Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products. Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money). Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer. One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer. Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail *Concentrate Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99 Liters of product per container 12 Flavor/l $0.42 *Carbonator Volume of CO2 130 Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99 CO2 cost per liter $0.23 *Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter Equipment cost $89.00 Equipment life (years) 5 Discount rate (cost of money) 8% Liters per month 10.00 Monthly amortized cost $1.80 Cost of equipment per liter $0.18 *Water Cost with Brita Filtration Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004 Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95 Brita cost per liter $0.0373 Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377 (assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration) ***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2 SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73 Without filtered water: SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65 *****What does CO2 Really Cost???? THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW *Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit) weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2 cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35 CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams *Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation losses: 10% available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85% net accessible CO2 of total: 77% usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams *Output carbonated liters of water: 2,479 cost per liter in USD$: $0.014 *SodaStream Output SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product) Cost per refill: $30.00 cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231 *SodaStream Markup Economics ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534% math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing This is an incredible 1500% markup Pros Saves plastic Allows flexible mixture of flavors Cons Cost of output is not compelling Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit ***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times. At the time of this review, I did NOT have an investment in SodaStream either short or long. In the past, I have both owned the stock and shorted it (bet against it). I may be on either side of the trade by the time you read this -- I am not very sentimental. …",31 out of 36 users found this review helpful
" Never recieved it, company ignoring my emails",1,"This item was a part of an order that had two other items, each from different sender. I received the first two within a few days, this one never showed up. When it was already a few days late I had an order number so I checked where it was to see why I haven't still gotten it. It was delivered. To San Diego, California. I live in SLC Utah! OK. Just a mistake, no problem. I emailed the company and they gave the shipping number to check where it is because they sent it. First of all, they gave me a wrong number, luckily I had mine saved from when I made the order. When I copy pasted the delivery to Sand Diego info and asked them what is up with that, I never got the reply back. I tried again a few days later asking do they intend to resend this item or will they give me a refung....still no replay. This is not a lot of money, but it **** me of that I ordered something through Superstore and the company is doing this. I will most definitely never order anything from them again, and today I am contacting Superstore to see what they can do about it. it isn't the money, it's the principal! …",16 out of 51 users found this review helpful

" Flour, as stated, not powder",3,"Searching the internet may tell you that malt flour is sometimes called malt powder. This may lead you to believe that this is a malt powder, such as you might use for making beer or a killer malted milkshake. Although this product is visually indistinguishable from such malt powder, it tastes like flour, and cannot be used for these purposes unless you like four in your milkshake. It does make for really good pancakes, as long as you don't add too much. I would go no more than 1/4 malt flour to 3/4 regular flour, and possibly less. …",19 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 A remakably mixed review,4,"This olive oil adds a freshness to every dish that you're bound to notice. It's true what the others are saying, this oil is different than most others. When I first got tasted it strait, was shocked at the resemblence to wheat grass juice and the bitterness that lingers in the back of your throat. Compared to my regular store bought EVOO's heaviness and richness, this one is clean and bright. But my first reaction was to write the seller and find out if my bottle tasted as it should or if I'd gotten a bad bottle. They wrote back saying that the grassy flavor and ""peppery notes"" (bitterness, in my book) comes from the relatively young olives. I was also impressed by the fact that I got this in Sept and it was bottled as recently as August, probably also responsible for the fresh taste. Getting this olive oil inspired me to try some other brands and I have found a very similar taste without the bitterness in the slightly less exensive Trader Joe's Australian variety of EVOO. Both are great when used in fresh dishes and shine best when they aren't cooked. My biggest question is, why aren't people reviewing more EVOO products on Superstore. The fact that this one is the only one who's following sings it's praises here should tell you that it's worth trying. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!,5,"I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy. The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes. My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical. Obviously, my experience made me a believer! I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands. And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Tasty but high-fat,4,"These cookies are very tasty, surprisingly crisp and light, and don't taste at all like comparable inexpensive packaged cookies from the US. They are made in Poland for a German company and taste a lot like many confections from Europe, where crisp wafers and balanced tasting fillings are the norm(rather than the over-sweet cream fillings common here in the US) Contrary to another review here, the ingredients/nutrients list states that are are 0g of trans-fats in theese cookies. However, there's a LOT of saturated fat. That's a concern because if you're a normal healthy adult, you could easily eat a package of these in one sitting (only 5 ounces!)...in which case you would have had about your week's worth of saturated fat in one sitting! Since our country has a massive (literally) weight problem, that's something to be aware of. Hard to beat the taste for the price, but eat with care. …",29 out of 36 users found this review helpful

" Not bad, not great either.",3,"I purchased this coffee because both the Newman's Own and Sumatran Reserve were priced up near $1 per k-cup this month, and I needed something dark and bold to replace them until the prices came back down. This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish. The caffeine content is acceptable. The package could have been treated a little better during shipping as there were lots of dents, crushed corners and sides, and evidence of bending on the sides of the k-cups. None of the cups have thus far shown a broken seal though. Overall this is an acceptable extra bold style k-cup, but there are better options out there. My favorites have been the Newman's Own and the Sumatran Reserve. I haven't tried the Black Diamond K-cups as they are a bit pricey right now also. I'll probably end up using a coupon and buying my preferred flavors in a brick and mortar store nearby for a better price, or ordering some Coffee People 50-count extra bold flavors. Their boxes have had pretty stable pricing for the past 6 months or so. If you are out of options, this is a cheaper substitute for a pricier extra bold flavor. I wish Superstore could sort out their supply issues and keep K-cup prices a little more stable. Lastly, I wouldn't buy these again if I had other similar priced options. TL;DR - These are okay, but go for other extra bold flavors if they are priced about the same. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Great Coffee--competetive price!,5,"I've had my Keurig brewer for 5 months and have tried a lot of brands and the Coffee People Donut Shop regular is among my favorites. Green Mountain Nantucket Blend and Timothy's Italian Blend are also favorites. One reviewer remarked about Subscribe & Save costing less. It's only a dollar and a few pennies cheaper than this packaging and Subscribe and Save does not offer Donut Shop ""regular"" but instead has ""Extra Bold"". Also, this packaging gives you 50 k-cups as opposed to 48 (2) 24 count packages in Subscribe & Save. Another reviewer complained about not having the standard boxes to dispense the coffee.

" Good, for American tea",4,"While Lipton seems to have borrowed the pyramid shape idea from PG Tips, they have improved on the concept of the triangular bag. This mesh bag allows for more water to pass through and for the tea drinker to observe the handsome, long leaves.

 The office coffee club consensus,3,"My office has a coffee club where everyone chips in and we buy coffee to try from all over. We ordered Kicking Horse Coffee Kick **** Dark to give it a try. This coffee is roasted very dark roast without being burnt. Those of us in the office who like our coffee on the strong side really enjoyed the blend. It is a blend, I would assume of Sumatran and Costa Rican beans. The roast was actually too strong for the coffee drinkers who like light to medium roasts so we will not be purchasing this one again. I took a little of this home and tried it in the Moka pot. I personally like dark roasts and this was too strong for me when using the espresso esk method. I'm giving this three stars because it's not for everyone. I feel the blend could have been a little better (use of cheaper Central American beans) at he $11 plus per pound reduced Superstore price. …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 The price is right,5,"We have a little Maltese that we spoil to no end. These treats are the perfect size for him and he loves them. He can be a little picky. Among his daily treats are Greenies and since we found these on Superstore, Zuke's Jerky Naturals. I will say that we tried two different kinds. Along with these, we tried the WellBites Chicken and Venison Recipe Dog Treats, 8-Ounce Pouch . The Zuke's are really potent. When you open the bag, you catch a big whiff of how strong they are. They're probably real flavorful because of it (I didn't try one). The Wellness treats seem a little dryer. While our little guy likes both of the treats, the Zuke's win over the Wellness. Plus they're cheaper so that's even better. He can't get enough of them. We also tried the Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch made by Zuke's. He doesn't like those as much as the Greenies. I would say that this product is one of the best we found for our dog. Plus we were able to take advantage of the free super saver shipping as well. These are highly recommended. [Edit: August 14, 2011] He still loves them! We've had to start giving our little guy Remedel for a little shoulder injury he had. These Zukes make it real easy to give him the pill. Since they're moist, we just put the pill inside and press it all around the pill. That way he doesn't even know he's taking it. Trying to give him pills with the Wellness treats doesn't work so well since they're dryer. [Edit: September 29, 2012] Anyone else notice that they seem different?? The last couple packs we bought were dryer and brittle. They also weren't as potent as the other ones were. He doesn't seem to like them as much any more. I don't know if the bags we bought were partially opened so they dried out by the time the were delivered or if their recipe changed. I'll buy some more and see how they turn out.

 Not a K-cup but works in a Keurig,4,"As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on Superstore. Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable! …",45 out of 48 users found this review helpful

" Not great matcha, but for the price it's good for everyday use",3,"It tastes good enough and is affordable enough to use every day. It's not sweet and super bright, almost-neon green like medium and high grade matcha, but it's not bitter, unpleasant, stale, and brownish like Malden's similarly priced matcha. It is only slightly more expensive than Malden's matcha ($3.40/oz. or $2.62/oz. in bulk vs. Malden's $2.50/oz) but the quality is superior. I highly recommend this as an overall good mathca at a really good price. If this is the first matcha you try you won't be disappointed.

 For those  who like mild coffee,5,"I have a Keurig in the office for guests (and myself) but I learned that most of my guests prefer a lighter roast than I do. After tasting the Veranda Blend, I found it was light, but very aromatic and you could still add sugar and cream and it was very similar to a good restaurant coffee. So when supplying choices of blends for guests, I'm including Veranda as a milder blend for those who don't like French Roast or Sumatra or other bold blends. I find that there is a bit of woodiness, but also a slight flavor of nuts and cocoa. It's a pleasant blend of coffee and a very good cup if you don't want something awfully strong. Some lighter roasts are acid to me, but this one seems to be balanced. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Can't live without it,5,"Having suffered from Chronic Candida Albicans for over 10 years, I finally came to terms with the idea that I CANNOT have any type of sugars or sweeteners, not even natural sugars from fruits. Being a fruit lover who used to eat lots of fruits on a daily basis, I started looking for a safe way to have sweet stuff without feeding the microorganisms that have been for so long attacking my system. After a lengthy research of more than a year, I found out that though most sweeterners FEED bacteria and Candida Albicans, Xylitol DOES NOT. I started using Xylitol regularly and found out, to my surprise, that my worst Candida symptoms were GONE. The symptoms would recur every time I had fruits (darn!)or something made with refined sugar or other sweeteners like Splenda or Stevia, or even the Aspartame that is used on Diet Drinks. Whether I liked it or not, it became clear to me that I could not eat or drink anything sweet, that I could neither have any fruits and that I could not drink any diet sodas. I have intensely and extensively ""tested"" Xylitol for over a year and I can AFFIRM without a doubt that it is the ONLY sweetener I can use without getting my symptoms back. I buy chocolates made with Xylitol on a regular basis and I use this brand of Xylitol to make chocolate bread and all kinds of cookies. I also make healthy chocolate ice cream with Xylitol, unsweetened cocoa powder and soy milk. If it were not for Xylitol, I would not be able to put anything sweet in my mouth. One of the most recognizable and annoying Candida Albicans symptoms was that I had to get up every one or two hours every night to urinate (!!). It was a nightmare, but it helped immensely when it came to ""testing"" what was good or bad for me. Conclusion: If I stay away from all types of sugars, natural fruits, fruit juices and sweeteners, and only use Xylitol-sweetened stuff, I feel much better in every respect and, very importantly, I can sleep 6 or more hours in a row without waking up to go to the bathroom. …",30 out of 30 users found this review helpful
 Not as heathful of a snack as you might think,3,"The good news is that the peanut butter flavor of these granola bars is really good. When I first bit into one, I immediately thought I was eating a peanut butter cookie. They're very reminiscent of a Girl Scout peanut butter cookie, minus the cream filling of course. That brings me to the bad news. While a serving of these granola bars has a tad less fat and sugar than a cookie, the difference isn't great. If you don't believe me, just look at the nutritional information for a Nutter Butter cookie here. That doesn't mean that this isn't a good snack to have on occasion. These are a healthier alternative than a candy bar, for example, but they're really not much different than a cookie. In other words, even though most people would equate granola bars with health food, one must be careful not to overindulge in these. …",21 out of 26 users found this review helpful

Those who say they work for a while and then quit need to remember that the traps are only meant to catch flying stages of the insect. I use these traps once or twice a year, whenever I see a moth or two, once the infestation problem has been solved. 1) Use Pantry Pest Traps to eliminate all ADULT moths. 2) Next, go on a larva hunt (in the early stages they look like caraway seeds -- dark little crescent shapes about 1/8"" long). Check all the food in your cabinets. Take it all out. Anything can house larva. Look in the flour, cereals, boxes, bags, anything with a seam or crevice. Think like a mother -- she is trying to hide her young so that they will survive! 3) We have a pantry cabinet with adjustable shelves. When moths kept coming back, I got a flashlight and discovered that there was larva in every single hole for the shelf brackets. Swabbing the holes with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol produced mixed results, so I finally placed a piece of tape over each hole. If the larva survived the alcohol, they starved to death in their little cell. Using this method, I buy traps when moths come in with the groceries. I use canvas shopping bags that I wash every now and then so that the bags from the store (especially paper bags) don't bring in larva. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Not nutritionally sound,1,"I had been using this food mixed with the canned science diet for my lab puppy (because that is what the shelter had used), and didn't have any issues. However, after reading the other review, I asked the manager at a local pet food store what he thought of this brand, and he said it was NOT good - all fillers (corn) and animal by-products. He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content. (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc). He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist. (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.) Finally, he also said that bully sticks are far better for dogs than rawhide (which are basically like eating leather). …",6 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Nut Milk Bag vs Paint Strainer Bag,5,"I bought a couple strainer bags at Home Depot for about 2.50. I used one bag for maybe 5 times and it was obvious that it was loosing integrity every time I used it. I don't think I could have got 5 more uses out of it. It did work fine... though I think that the pulp was starting to stick to the bag a little. I would NOT recommend buying paint strainer bags. This nut milk bag works great. I have used it to make almond milk about 20-25 times now. I can see it easily lasting quite awhile....at least a year. Though I will update my review as time passes. It is easy to clean and the mylk goes through well. I think it is well made. For the convenience of buying this and having it last a long time and not making one myself, I think this bag is definitely worth the investment. The only thing I think the maker should change is the drawstring. It is made out of a slippery type rope and when you tie it, it does not knot tight and stay knotted. So I have to re knot it many times. Also, the rope is starting to fray at the ends. Even so, I am still giving 5 stars for this product. Advise....buy this nut milk bag and not the paint strainer bag …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Superior product!,5,"I have just recently begun using VCO for nearly all of my cooking. After purchasing two books on the benefits of coconut oil, I have purchased several different brands of oil. The Nutiva Organic EVCO is by far a superior oil with a delightful flavor. The price from Superstore if you are a Prime member is the best I have found for this quality of oil. I began eating the oil mixed in about 1/2 cup of cottage cheese because I read on a forum that cottage cheese has properties which help the body assimilate the oil. Since then I have expanded to many other uses. I use the oil to sautee garlic, onions, peppers, etc for all of my soups and stir frys. I spread it on toast and add it to my corn bread. In just the first week of eating coconut oil regularly I noticed that my chronic aches in my joints and muscles subsided. My skin is smoother and blemishes began to disappear. I began using it as a topical ointment on my hands, feet and face along with knees and elbows. It is a much better skin conditioner than almost anything else I have used. I found that it also works great as a conditioner for all of my wooden cooking utensils and I rub it into my cutting boards to condition them. It is far superior to mineral oil! I have introduced the oil into my husband's diet also. He has been a Type II diabetic for about 15 years and just turned 77. He is beginning to notice positive benefits also. He particularly has noticed more mental acuity. He adds the oil to his morning cereal and spreads it on his toast and really enjoys the flavor. I am so happy to have found this wonderful Nutiva oil and appreciate its many benefits. I find it kind of addictive. I now look forward to adding the oil to more and more foods and it seems to make nearly everything, including eggs, soups, stews, casseroles, muffins and breads more delicious. I highly recommend the Nutiva brand of Organic EVCO for a huge variety of uses. To those who think it has too much coconut flavor - well, I guess you can't please everyone. Try it and decide for yourself. The health benefits are worth it! This oil has given me a new energy and improved my health so positively that I would recommend it to everyone. The only downside I can mention is the plastic container. It would be better if it were packaged in glass, but hopefully all those anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties of the oil will negate the use of a plastic container ;-) …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
" Bold robust flavor. Refreshing for all occasions, great for colds and weight loss!",5,"Red Zinger is the tea that made Celestial Seasonings famous. This was the must-have tea in the seventies. Every well stocked hippie cupboard had to have this tea next to the brown rice and soy sauce. The ingredients are healthy and tasty, and blend into a tasty ruby potion that smells lemon-mint tart. Red Zinger is especially good for colds--the ingredients strengthen the immune system and the tea is soothing to the throat. It is also great for a diet tea--the bold flavor helps with cravings and the diuretic ingredients prevent and ameliorate water retention. And aside from its benefits it is just a delicious tea! The flavor is sour-cherry with a hint of mint and flavorful hot or cold. Hibiscus is the first ingredient. First consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Hibiscus tea has diuretic qualities, can lower blood pressure, and has minerals and flavonoids. The second ingredient, rose hips, are very high in vitamin C and are used in herbal medicine to prevent urinary tract infections. Other ingredients include peppermint, lemon grass, orange peel, lemon myrtle, licorice and wild cherry bark. Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface. Quote from the box: ""Passion colors all that it touches in its own hues.""

 Now I Make Pad Thai that Tastes Like It Should!,5,"Tamarind paste has not been a staple in my pantry -- until I discovered what a difference it can make in my cooking. I created a marvelous Pad Thai sauce, simply by using this paste (and a few other ingredients). For all its goodness, I have to say that you've got to have a little faith in order to put something like this in a sauce. It resembles nothing so much as road tar, black, gooey, utterly yucky-looking. But do give it a shot -- its worth your time and effort. By the way, I bought the 6-pack.

 Deceptive labeling for glorified peanut bars,1,"I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description. It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond, walnut and macadamia, especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list. Maybe they think that people can't tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts? I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK, but I have a hard time believing that the 4.5 star rating the product currently receives hasn't been created by company shills. It is a shame too, since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description.

So when supplying choices of blends for guests, I'm including Veranda as a milder blend for those who don't like French Roast or Sumatra or other bold blends. I find that there is a bit of woodiness, but also a slight flavor of nuts and cocoa. It's a pleasant blend of coffee and a very good cup if you don't want something awfully strong.

 Better than most,4,"This came in a small box of ten foil packages three inches long and a half-inch wide. There is a cut at one end that allows you to open the foil package so none of the usual difficulties with getting these things open just to spill out some of the contents. The package says to mix with one 16-ounce bottle of water. The powder mixed into the water completely by the time I was ready to put the lid on to shake it up. It turned the water a light pink. This flavor of Stix To Go does not have aspartame in it. The box says sweetened with honey and indeed honey granules are the first ingredients, however there is also sucralose, similar to Splenda. There is also maltodextrin, which is often used in soda or candy as a thickener, but it is made from real food not chemicals. The other ingredients are the flavors and hibiscus extract. WebMD says that hibiscus extract is used to improve odor, flavor, and appearance of tea. The package also says that a serving size is half of a package at five calories, but you are told to add the whole package to a bottle of water, so beware if you are counting calories. The taste is not bad. I do not drink anything with artificial sweeteners because I cannot stand the aftertaste, but I did not notice an aftertaste with this.

 VERY FRESH PEANUTS THOUGH AN EXPENSIVE WAY TO BUY THEM,4,"IN A NUTSHELL: EACH PACKAGE CONTAINED 2 OZ. OF FRESH PEANUTS OR CASHEWS These 2 oz. packages are filled with fresh nuts with nothing but salt added [& peanut oil or cottonseed oil]. As snack foods go, this is a very healthy choice. Although expensive on an ounce for ounce basis, as portions of snack foods go, this is still a fair value and a relatively healthy choice. Bear in mind that about 75% of the 170 calories per ounce are from fat, but there are NO TRANS-FATTY ACIDS or CHOLESTEROL while there are some healthy mono-saturated oils. My big complaint against many other snack-nut products is their lack of freshness, and in fact a rancid taste to the nuts which NEVER happened with these Planters nuts. In fact, each individual package has an expiration date clearly marked on the front of the package. BOTTOM LINE: I PREFER THE LARGER JAR BECAUSE I EAT MORE THAN 2 OZ. AT A TIME My preference is to get these peanuts and cashews in the larger jar and unsalted, but for the summer, the salt is okay and the freshness was consistent in every package.

 NO MORE CRAMPS!,5,"I used to have EXTREMELY bad cramps during my time of the month. When I say EXTREME, I mean cramping so bad that I would have minor blackouts. My mother-in-law suggested I take some organic virgin coconut oil and I took a tablespoon of it, however it didn't taste good at all. It did make my cramps go away for that entire day. So my wonderful husband went out and bought me some of these capsules from the health food store, I was kind of skeptical b/c he paid $20 for it, but I thanked him and started popping the suggested amount, 3 caps, 3 times a day. Since the caps have a small amount in each cap, you have to take that many to get it in your system. The first month I took them, the cramps subsided to just enduring slight pain in the morning on my first day. The second month I didn't experience any PMS symptoms and even less pain on the first day. The third month I experienced NO PMS and NO PAIN through my whole 7 days. I've heard it is good for lowering your cholesterol and help maintain weight amongst other things. I'm just happy they made my cramps go away. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product.

 NOT natural - ingredient list NOT accurate,1,"I was very excited to find a natural beef jerky without any wheat in the ingredient list! HOWEVER, once we actually got it and read the (very long) ingredient list, we were very disappointed. Here's what the manufacturer listed as ingredients: Ingredients: Beef, Lite Salt (Salt, Potassium Chloride), Chilies, Brown Sugar, Sugar, Black Pepper, Garlic, Citric Acid and Cornstarch. Here's the actual ingredient list from the Hoppin' Hickory flavor: Ingredients: Beef, water, corn syrup, sugar, salt, soy sauce powder (naturally fermented soy beans, wheat, salt, maltodextrin), worcestershire sauce powder, corn syrup solids, salt, caramel color, garlic powder, sugar, spices, soy sauce solids, naturally fermented wheat and soybeans, salt, maltodextrin, caramel color), palm oil, tamarind, natural flavor, citric acid, garlic powder, onion powder, spice. Not the worst ist in the world, but since we have wheat allergies, we can't actually eat the product. We're also trying to avoid corn syrup. I realize it takes a while to type out all of the lable ingredient lists, but since these are non-returnable items and will be ingested, it is the manufacurers responisbility to inform customers accurately regarding what is actually in the product. Another reviewer mentioned that a product had sucralose in it...some folks get very sick from these ingredients. It's my responsibility to read the package and double check prior to actually eating someting (which I did) - but it's disappointing, expensive, and a hassle to get something other than what I've ordered.

For the most part, Gu gel is good tasting, and I agree that Espresso Love is the best. The plain is ... well ... plain, but the chocolate and berry are also good. Like I said, I prefer the consistency of PowerGel better because it is easier to get down when you are running and sucking on a gel packet, a little thicker.

I refrigerate them in the summer or they kind of ""wilt"". The ingredients are fresh, and the nuts are crunchy. What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them. Those nuts are meant to be chewed and not inhaled, unlike a lot of snacks that disappear as soon as you get the wrapper off. I can't eat one in front of my favorite dog, as this is one snack I am too fond of to share with her... much to her dismay.

 Love it!,5,"I have a 8.5 month old Aussie mix. She's about 42 lbs now. This food is magic!! I love it! She's never been ""food motivated"" and so she's always been a little reluctant to eat her kibble, but she honestly LIKES this stuff. She'll do tricks for it like it is a treat. More importantly, her poop is GREAT on this kibble. Finally, it's easy to pick up! This food is a godsend. We've previously tried Innova EVO, California Natural Lamb and Rice Puppy and Adult, and Canidae All Life Stages. Innova EVO gave her the runs, but she was a new puppy. (The pet food store said EVO was rich enough for puppies. My vet disagreed.) California Natural seemed better, but her poop was always so soft that it was messy to pick up, and she never really liked it. She liked the taste of Canidae better - so much so that she would pick it out when I mixed it with the Lamb and Rice. However, her poop didn't really improve until we shifted to Orijen. Magic. This stuff is magic, I say. Besides being the magic food for my dog, it's also made in Canada with almost all Canadian ingredients. From what I've read, they get rice from California and Lamb from New Zealand, but otherwise -- everything comes from farms in and around Alberta. No food recalls on this brand!

 Excellent,5,"I've come to trust the Stash brand, among only a few others due to its consistently excellent product line and variety. I was initially a fan of English Breakfast tea, but was introduced to Irish Breakfast tea some time back. A slightly thicker liquor produced than does English Breakfast, it mixes well with a variety of items (sugar and milk are recommended, but certain alcoholic bases or mixers sit quite nicely if you want to switch up the classic Hot Toddy concept or use Kahlua instead of sugar), and has an even stronger aroma and flavor than your regular black tea. If you're a fan of weaker brews where one or two dunks is good enough, this is not for you. I tend to steep this for a long while (tea experts would call me nuts for doing this as it could scald and alter the flavor of the leaves), but I love the strength of the brew afterwards. This is great to have on-the-go, too, and hearty to drink if you're ill and require a lot of liquids. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" Still Too Much Fat, But Less Than Some Flavors...",3,"Tried this, recently, (in all dry flavors) for my German Shepherd Dog. At first, he wouldn't touch it, but after about a week, he decided he absolutely loves it. The biggest problem is within the first month, he had gained 3 pounds, even though he was eating less than the recommended amount and less than he was previously used to eating. Also, he had soft, oily looking stools while eating this. He is an active, very healthy, well-exercised, older dog. He did seem to be more ""chipper"" and health-wise, he seemed to do fine, except for the softer stools and weight gain, but reluctantly, we had to stop feeding this, exclusively, as we were feeding less and less and he was still gaining weight AND seemed hungry all the time, looking for any other food to eat. Since he loves the taste so much, we have decided to give him only a cup or so a day, in his Kong, with his other food or as training treats and have switched him to another food. I'm not sure I agree with the ""good for all life stages"" philosophy either. In the old days, that was what one did, but now that we know much more about nutrition, I believe that different life stages do require different nutrient levels. Much as humans do. Sadly, for our dog, this can not be the only food he eats, but it will remain a part of his daily diet, since he loves it and did well, except for the fat content. Hope this helps! …",15 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Based on beef being grass fed however . . .,5,"the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately I'm unable to review the flavor as I forgot I can't have beef anymore (due to health issues). Ingredients: beef, flavoring supplement (salt, dextrose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, spices, spice extractives, soybean oil), vinegar, brown sugar, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices Here is some info found on the internet: Maltodextrin ~ maltodextrin from corn or soy can be very unsafe/poison for anyone. As all GMO products like corn and soy are genetically engineered from the monsanto company. they insert a bacteria in all GMO products, and this changes the natural organic developing of corn or soy. do not buy anything that contains maltodextrin or titanium for your own health. Maltodextrin made in the US is made from corn. Corn in the US is a GMO food so Maltodextrin as derived from a Gmo is extremely unsafe. Soy ~ this particular info from: (...) . . .fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits. Fermented soy does not wreak havoc on your body like unfermented soy products do. Here is just a sampling of the health effects that have been linked to unfermented soy consumption: *Breast cancer *Brain damage *Infant abnormalities *Thyroid disorders *Kidney stones *Immune system impairment *Severe, potentially fatal food allergies *Impaired fertility *Danger during pregnancy and nursing and for all ~ Jesus Christ (Yahushua HaMashiach) is coming back. Don't leave this world without Him... Gift of God With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news. It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world. Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God. The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God. The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction. Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc. The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever? Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God. God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven? My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight! It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him! Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death. Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ! Yahushua loves you! …",3 out of 38 users found this review helpful

 The Pros and Cons,3,"Kellogg's Special K Cereal, Red Berries, 16.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4), is a delicious cereal. Since Kellogg is number one -- the number one producer of convenience food in the world --we know Kellogg will give us what we want while ignoring the things that do not matter to us. What do we want? (1) Flavor. Those real freeze dried strawberries are so delicious that we are tempted to eat them dry out of the box and leave the cereal. The cereal tastes good too. It is sweet, and there is malt flavoring that we love. (2) Nutrition. With 110 calories per cup, we can measure out a cup and use it for diet food. It has vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, B vitamins, and minerals. (3) Grain. There are crispy rice and wheat flakes. What does not matter to us? (Or does it?) (1) Sugar. The cereal is loaded with it, but if we did not have it in the cereal, many of us would spoon in a generous application. The second ingredient is sugar. Is that cane or corn? Also listed in the ingredients is high fructose corn syrup. (2) Nutrition. It is hard to stop with one cup full because we are used to feeling full. A cup of light cereal takes us through the motion of eating slowly . . . that's a plus . . . but does not satisfy the way whole grain cereal does. About the added nutrition: some of us don't need all of what it gives us, or maybe we really do prefer to take them in pill form so we know we exactly what we are getting. Many of us take in more iron than is considered healthy for our specific needs. What your physician will tell you about this issue may be surprising. (3) Grain. If we are allergic to wheat, we need to pay attention to the label. Also there is corn in the form of fructose. What we are getting is highly refined grain products when whole grain would be better for our health by providing fiber. With the price out of the range of what we usually spend on breakfast foods, I don't find it a good value. …",22 out of 29 users found this review helpful

 best dog food!!!,5,"I've been giving this brand of dog food to my small dogs (10-12 pounds each), since the tainted dog food incident a few years ago (it takes them probably 6-8 months to go through 30 pounds). When I got a new puppy (doberman), I thought this would be a little expensive, since he eats a LOT. I looked through PetCo at just about all the different dog foods around this same price (I didn't really look at the ones that were more, since I'm pretty happy with the food). I found that this was the ONLY dog food in this price range that had the first TWO ingredients being meat (or meat by product). In fact, many of the dog foods (the kinds that you find in the grocery store) actually had the FIRST ingredient being filler. In case you don't know, the largest quantity ingredient is listed 1st and so on down to the smallest. He did have diahrea for the first couple of days, but that is because I did not transition him to this food. Sadly, he had moved from one house to another house to our house within 36 hours, and I did not get information from the original owner about what he had been eating. I mention this mostly to refute the other lower rating - most dogs need to transition in foods or they will get diahrea. So typically, one should mix the old dog food with the new one, in decreasing increments over about two weeks, until the dog is eating 100% of the new food. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Very Good Meat Snack - Highly Recommended,5,"Jack Link's ""X-Stick Original"" snack sticks are very good tasting and far less greasy than other ""meat sticks"" (like Slim Jim). These are great snacks for diabetics (like me) since they have a negligible amount of Net Carbs.

Overall, these are great as a snacks between meals and they are so much better than the competition. Highly Recommended! CFH …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Pleasantly Surprised!,5,"I was skeptical about purchasing a coffee specifically formulated for making iced coffee. I mean, I spent all last summer making iced coffee from extra bold k cups and they were very good. So, what's the big deal? I'll tell you, I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't realize it before, but the flavors of doing it my old way were not quite as rich and complex as these Nantucket blend iced coffee k cup. Plus, when I was brewing it my old way on the iced coffee setting and barely getting a cup full. With the iced coffee k cups, I brew it on the 6 oz setting, and get a nice big full cup of iced coffee with just enough room to add a little 1/2 and 1/2. Sir in a generous spoon of sugar and you get an iced coffee better than the donut and coffee shops for a mere fraction of the cost. Try these; you'll love 'em. Oh, and it might be worth noting, for those of you who feel the same way and were wondering, I do not particularly like the regular Nantucket K cups for hot coffee. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Money saver!!,5,"As a huge fan of Keurig brewing, I was delighted to discover Solofill cups! I have been using mine for a couple months and love the versatility and the ease of using this Kcup replacement. Unlike the ""My Kcup"" holder that you can use with most Keurig machines, this little gem pops right in without having to remove the pod holder from the brewer. The Solofill takes about 2 tablespoons of coffee and that's the main appeal of this. You can use your own ground coffee instead of always having to buy the pricey pre-filled Kcups. It makes a great cup of coffee and allows users to buy any kind of coffee they please. Some users have complained about cleaning the Solofill. I find it easy. Just tap the cooled coffee grounds on the edge of your trash receptacle and most will fall out. Then rinse it out and it's ready to go again. I keep two handy so I can be using one and cleaning the other. I see this little invention as a great way to save money and have options as to the kinds and types of coffee you want to use. …",538 out of 544 users found this review helpful
 Wonderful if you can handle salt,5,"I was delighted to be able to order these, since local stores no longer carry them. The bags contain what appear to be chips of pork skin that were parboiled in salt water, then flattened under high pressure. Be sure to shake them around to distribute them throughout the bag before cooking. They expand considerably in the bag during 1:00 to 2:00 of nuking, depending on the wattage, etc., but it is a slow expansion, unlike the vigorous popping of corn. Also, the bag only expands about half as much as with popcorn. When ready, these resemble the ones available in cellophane bags that were deep-fried, but these are far tastier, fresher, AND MUCH LOWER IN FAT AND CALORIES. A whole bag is 210 calories, about 50 calories from fat. This is less than the low-fat microwave popcorn I use. One bag, however, has 50% of the daily salt limit for an adult. I especially like these sprinkled with garlic powder and dried marjoram (together). Other herbs and spices are interesting variations, such as sage or cumin or whatever else might appeal to you. …",31 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 Sweetened cardboard,1,"This cereal is extremely crunchy and tends to be formed in huge lumps unsuitable for eating. ""Sweetened cardboard"" is what always comes to mind when I try to describe the taste. It is extremely low in calories compared to other cereals and granolas, but I found it practically inedible. …",6 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Great Green Tea and Great Company!,5,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family. I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine. After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals. Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide. I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others. Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me. I think it tastes great for a decaff tea. It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste. I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Best Baby Food Maker,5,"I got the Brezza as a gift right before my son transitioned to solid food. I didn't think I was going to be the type to make my own food, but it was so easy with the Brezza. I would throw a bunch of raw veggies in the cooker and in 10 or 15 minutes everything would be cooked and pureed. Seriously, the easiest thing ever. Plus, after having bought some jarred baby food from the market, I can truly appreciate the difference in food that is homemade. The clean-up is really easy too since all of the steaming and the pureeing happens in the same canister. It is definitely a great purchase if you are considering making your own baby food. It spans beyond purees too, because you can use the steam function to make veggies for the kids as they get older. From one mom to another, I would highly recommend the Brezza. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Great source of lean protein,4,"Perhaps the purest source of protein (70% of each serving is pure protein) that I've found out there. And for the health-conscious, it has very few ingredients (""hemp protein concentrate + natural plant extracts"") so there's really no filler or ****. It's made from ground hemp seed which has had the liquid pressed out of it and then the fiber removed so it is as high a concentration of protein as can be. Be aware: if you use a lot and don't get a decent amount of fiber and water, it could cause minor constipation since it's water-soluble. Normally, this is not a problem. It's great to have a plant-based, non-hydrolyzed, sustainable protein source for building lean muscle. Taste is okay. I can drink it straight mixed with water, but I'm normally downing it in one or two gulps. I love mixing it with oatmeal - doesn't really throw off the taste, but does give it a slight green tint - and putting it in smoothies. Mix it with berries and juices you love, you'll never know it was there! It is a bit pricey. I can get a decent deal when it's on sale at my local health food store, but it's cheapest bought directly from Manitoba Harvest's website. You can buy it in bulk there! Recommended. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 No Acai BERRIES ! very misleading label - not healthy,1,"Notice it doesnt say Acai BERRIES? That's because the interior of the candies are actually just a berry flavored gelatin - like the inside of a jelly bean. So these are just chocolate covered jellybeans, not real chocolate covered berries. Ingredients are fruit juice and fructose. Frankly it tastes like the main flavoring ingredient is sugar and cheap grape/apple juice to me. You cant even taste Acai. This product is intentionally trying to ride the healthy berries and chocolate bandwagon. Yet it is full of unhealthy ingredients unlike what it label shows. So this is NOT a healthy snack like they are trying to portray. If chocolate jelly beans are what you want thats fine, just be aware that the label is very misleading IMHO. …",43 out of 45 users found this review helpful
 Don't use to color white chocolate or candy coating,3,"I bought these to color the coating I use for cake pops. With either melted white chocolate or the Wilton Candy Melts, both seized up when I added the gel coloring. I was able to get pastel colors okay without seizing but when I tried for a more vibrant look, it clumped so badly, I couldn't use it. The product is fine used for frostings or icings though. …",7 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Almond???,1,"It says almond blend, but it doesn't smell any almond, maybe there is only 0.00001% of the almond in the ingredients. It's pretty much rice powder, if you are OK to pay the price for rice powder, it's the choice. very disappointed. …",12 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Would not buy from again,1,"Seemed like it may have been a good product, but customer service was a nightmare. After multiple email requests to cancel my order to both their Superstore marketplace email and the customer service email on their website, I got no reply, except a notice three days later that my item had shipped. I refused the delivery and after a lot of phone calls finally got a refund. Hopefully not everyone's experience is like this, but as for me, I don't think I will be doing business with them again soon. …",0 out of 34 users found this review helpful
