" 1/10 as strong as other brands, won't disolve in HOT coffee",1,"I've loved using NuStevia for 5 years. I tried using this stevia instead. It's won't dissolve in HOT coffe. It takes 9 packets of this brand instead of 2 packets of other brands. Customer service refuses to pay for me to ship this back to them. Do not waste your money on this diluted, non-disolving stevia. It's cheaper to buy a more concentrated brand that will disolve in coffee. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Tasty Tea that Works!,5,"Along with pumping often, this tea has helped to increase my supply after returning to work. I tried fenugreek tablets, took the maximum dosage (12 tablets daily for the brand I purchased), and it did nothing. Lactation consultant said that for some people, the combination of herbs found in the tea is more effective than a single herb. I had a very hard time w/ my supply when I returned to work, but am determined to continue nursing. Here is what has helped: 1. Drinking this tea. I need to drink 4-5 cups a day for it to be effective. I just boil a pot of water in the morning, steep 5 bags for 15 minutes, and then drink the prepared tea throughout the day. 2. Pumping at least 3 times per day, either instead of nursing or 30 minutes after nursing. 3. Bringing pictures of the baby to work (not sure why this helped... maybe hormones?). Good luck! …",32 out of 42 users found this review helpful
 People consider this refreshing?,1,I'm sure the flaw with this product is with coconut water in general and not with Zico. I gasped when I first sipped this drink. There is a strange saltiness in the taste and the passion fruit and orange peel are barely perceivable. Superstore was kind enough to refund me the cost of this order. Lesson to be learned: try to find a sample of a product before you buy a case of it. …,11 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Traverse Dried Blueberries,4,"These blueberries are delicious. I just wish they sold an alternate version without sugar or oil. Blueberries shouldn't need sugar or, at least, I prefer them that way.

" Strong, Flavorful Coconut Cream",5,"This Coconut Cream has a bit of a grainy texture, which is not bad, as the cream melts easily in the mouth and leaves a strong coconut flavor. You can use it for curry dishes perfectly - just heat up the cream and blend in the spices. Yet, another good idea is to mix it with cacao powder and sweeten it a bit and cool it down in the fridge. You will get a chocolate with an exotic flair. I used to buy Coconut oil but Let's Do Organic Coconut Cream is much better for you. The latter has not only the good, healthy fats but also a lot of fiber, protein, and minerals, which the oil does not have. Unfortunately, they don't offer this cream in bulk or Food Service Size for the moment. As I use a lot, it would be more economical for me. I hope it will be available in bulk size again soon. …",48 out of 48 users found this review helpful
" No meat by-products, good and safe, Turkey & Chicken Dog Food",5,"Everyone knows about tainted pet food from China. Newman's Own is a branding that I can trust, and this one is a real winner. Newman's is what I would make if I were making it for my own family, as in you can trust that it is great tasting, good for you and safe to eat. I'm very pleased that the Newman's line was extended from people food to pet food. When it comes to moist dog food every single choice on the market has meat by-products except Newman's Own. My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety. In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too. While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog. One other finding: When you open almost any moist dog food you smell ""dog food"". When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat. It actually smells good. Imagine that. …",29 out of 29 users found this review helpful

 A very good product,5,"I have not purchased this brand from this company yet, but I am quite familiar with this product as a number of my friends, who I cook with, use them. These are a bit smaller than the normal size therefore are more suited for appetizers than for the main course. They are quite strong and very easy to work with. If you make an error, they let you off the hook. My friends have been delighted with the service this company offers and they have found them, i.e. the company, very easy to work with and more than accommodating. If you have never used spring roll wrappers, you need to read the directions carefully or work with someone who has experience with them. Having used the product and having dealt with people who have purchased these wrappers, I feel very comfortable in recommending them. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Very good coconut water,4,"I have been trying all brands of coconut water. I agree that the Vita Coco is perhaps the sweetest tasting coconut water. I bought the Naked Coconut water right when it became available (at a good price; keep an eye out as prices for several brands of coconut water has been fluctuating on Superstore). Anyway, Naked water is not as sweet as Vita Coco, yet not as sour as Zico. Naked water was certainly good enough to order more. I work outside in the Texas heat quite a bit. During this summer of 2010 (with temperatures above 100 degrees) I will work up a huge sweat, literally soaking my shirt. I found that drinking coconut water, of any brand, does wonders at refreshing me and giving me the energy I need to head back outside. Indeed, one memorable day I went inside to cool off; I was literally so tired that I thought I would not be able to go back out into that heat and finish my chores. However, after chugging down a container of cold coconut water and sitting for about ten minutes, I was amazed at how refreshed I felt. I was able to head back out and work up a new sweat. From that day on I have been a real fan of coconut water. I doubt the hype about being 'good for diabetes' and other health-related claims (I am diabetic and have found no difference in my blood sugar levels). However, coconut water does wonders at rehydrating the body: much better than Gatorade. Even Zico (which has been much maligned lately) does me great after a hot session in the heat. So, load up on coconut water. When you are overheated and thirsty, any brand will go down great. Keep an eye on the prices, since they seem to vary. …",27 out of 30 users found this review helpful
 sigh.,2,"i was thoroughly and deeply disappointed with this 'creamed coconut' specifically for one reason: the back of the box says to just combine it with water and 'allow it a minute to soften.' i just don't understand how they could write this. i waited for a few long minutes, and it simply softened, by the tiniest bit, around the edges. the rest, perfectly solid. so i left it for about four hours, by which time my cake had cooled, and still, it was utterly solid. depressing. eventually i pureed it in the food processor... and it even then did not reach the desired consistency, but at least i could pour it over my cake and give it the mild coconut deliciousness i wished for. i would only recommend this product to someone who had absolutely nothing else to use, so please do not buy this if you have another option, like organic cream of coconut. this only gained two stars from me for being organic. …",5 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Superb Dark Roast,5,"On their web site, Coffee Bean Direct advertises this as their darkest roast. Previously, on Superstore, I reviewed Coffee Bean Direct's Italian Espresso Roast and find the Super Dark Espresso to be equally good and only slightly different. For my basic observations see the previous review; this review will serve to give the reader my observations made in a side-by-side comparison. I have uploaded an image of the two roasts, the Italian Espresso on the left, the Super Dark Espresso on the right. Both are, clearly, Espresso roasts as evidenced by the surface oil on the beans. Both roasts are slightly unevenly roasted, the Italian Espresso more so than the Super Dark. Not clearly shown in the image is the fact that a small percentage of the beans of the Super Dark roast are starting to break apart, a consequence of exceeding the usual roasting temperatures of the so-called ""second crack."" So what? It indicates to me that the Super Dark roast beans have been roasted to a point beyond which further roasting would not be possible without destroying the beans (yielding a charcoal-like product). However, as noted, the added roasting has produced a more even dark roast which, in turn, has produced a coffee that is slightly more rich than the Italian Espresso roast. Here I would emphasize the word ""slightly""; apart from a side-by-side sampling, I doubt I could distinguish one from the other on a day-to-day basis. In a word, both roasts are superb and nicely priced. If I recall correctly, the Super Dark roast cost $3.00 more than the Italian Espresso roast, I should think a reasonable difference if one's palate is able to differentiate between the two roasts. In either case, I think anyone who enjoys dark roast coffees or Espresso will be happy with either of these blends. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 I Lost 6 pounds in 2 weeks!,5,"I was just two pounds shy of my Weight Watchers goal when I fell off the weight loss wagon and gained four additional pounds. Life was busy, and I wanted a fuss-free way to lose those last pounds before swimsuit season. Since I enjoy Special K products, I thought I'd put the Special K 2-Week Weight Loss Challenge to the test. I ate Special K cereal for two meals, snacked on fruits and veggies (instead of the recommend Special K snack products) and made healthy dinner choices. I didn't expect to lose 6 pounds as advertised, since my weight loss had slowed from months of dieting and I was near my goal weight. To my surprise, I lost 6 pounds and have finally reached my goal weight! ABOUT THE DIET: It's convenient and doesn't require much planning. However, it could get a little boring in the long run. It could also be difficult to meet daily nutritional requirements. Also, rapid weight loss could be difficult to maintain in the long run. If you've been dieting and just can't lose those last few pounds, or if you need to lose a few pounds fast for a big event, give Special K a try. ABOUT THE CEREAL: One can usually find a box of Special K in my kitchen cabinet. Most often, it is the Red Berries variety. I enjoy the Fruit and Yogurt flavor, as well, but the serving size is 1/4 cup less. The original flavor is also nice from time to time, but the Chocolatey Delight is just not a good idea, in my opinion. But back to the Red Berries. The cereal consists of the usual Special K flakes with dehydrated strawberries. Once I pour on my Silk Light soy milk, the berries plump up to add lots of real strawberry flavor. There are generous amounts of berries and the flakes stay crispy in milk. All in all, this is an excellent cereal that I highly recommend. …",12 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Buy Sicilian Almonds--All US Almond Crops are void of Nutrients!  Boiled/Pasteurized/ Radiated!,1,"All Almonds grown in the U.S.A. are DEAD! I found out that they are either full of pesticides and/or boiled. I purchase Sicilian Almonds, because they don't have to be ""pasteurized"".Russ Bianchi is the most famous formulator in the world. Here is THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENT and certified organic: [...], you can read about his company Adept Solutions, Inc. His credentials include PhD Harvard, PhD Berkley and UCSF. Here is his review of Almonds grown in the U.S. Illegal/medical legal POT is the number one cash crop in California, followed by almonds. As a matter of fact our founder and true great and good soul Ken Brailsford grew up in a part of California that had many almond orchards, where as yours truly grew up among the prune orchards (all now gone to grapes). California's gross production in revenue remains agricultural and mineral or petroleum output; not movie stars and silicon valley. I remind you the USDA (Congress - all incumbents in the US House and US Senate) LIED a few years back to EVERYONE, and ordered the ""pasteurization"" of the entire California Almond Crop (approximately 98 percent of the world's supply). There are always major problems whenever Uncle Sam (proven pimp for death merchants like Big Pharma, Genetic Modification, Tax Revenue From Tobacco, Alcohol, Guns, Ponzi Scheme Social Security, Eugenics, etc.) sticks their gluttonous claws into anything. In the case of almonds, there is NO ""pasteurization"" going on, almond growers and producers are forced to harmfully IRRADIATE the almonds (just like cancer causing scanners from TSA in airports); ripping out the nutrient values on all almond products. Oh, by the way, almond milk is highly heated, enzymatically dead, nonabsorbable and nutrient void, aseptic, white, fake, sugar water. Ladies and Gentlemen, the canary in the mine is not only dead, when it comes to what Uncle Sam has allowed to happen to food and beverage processing in America, the canary long ago disintegrated, and the mine has collapsed and been abandoned.

 The people at Hawaii Roasters know this is good coffee.,5,"Kona coffee is world reknowned as being some of the best in the world, and I can speak with experience knowing that this domestic blend compares favorably with some of the best. However, I only ask those in Hawaii who farm and roast these beans to forgive me for saying that I think Konas are a bit overrated in the world of coffee. Yes, these beans have a lot of flavor. The body is unrivalled. Everything is balanced in a way that is unique to the Kona bean, but there are no subtle undertones prevalent that make me like the Sumatran and Ethiopian beans so much better. The beans are aesthetically perfect in every way, and I only have to use about 2/3 the portion of what I would use to make my favorite brews, but this is where it gets touchy for me. I pay about $12-13 a lb for coffee that might not be better than Kona coffee, but I like it better. Hawaii Growers makes a mighty fine coffee, one of the best Konas I've ever tasted, but it isn't worth more than $25 a lb. No coffee is worth that to me, and I've tasted the world's finest. Hawaii Growers is very competitively priced compared to other Konas, so if Kona coffee is the drinker's coffee of choice, then Hawaii Growers is a great choice. For someone who prefers coffee from other regions, Kona still stacks up well, but a purchase for me was to simply try something new rather than to look for a new regular. …",41 out of 47 users found this review helpful

 WARNING - Contains DRM!,1,"The manufacturer of this innocuous looking animal has seen fit to hide a rather disgusting form of DRM in it without disclosing this fact to us paying customers. I purchased this rabbit for my daughter, as I thought it would be nice for her to have a more realistic toy than her current stuffed teddy bears and dolls. To my astonishment, it began to smell very bad after only a few hours, and eventually degraded into a hard, wrinkly lump of brittle rabbit flesh. Totally unsuitable for cuddling. It is obvious that the manufacturer expects you to then buy another to replace it. Well not this guy! Once I have been burned I do not return to the flame for more. I will not be purchasing another Cloverdale whole animal, and I suggest that none of you do either. If we continue to accept these practices, things will only become worse! What's next, Cloverdale? Bears with claws? *EDIT* It has come to my attention that this animal is intended to be either frozen or consumed immediately at time of receipt. I believe Superstore should be more thorough in their descriptions of products such as this! I do not think it is unreasonable to assume that people will be buying this animal for reasons other than consumption. Until Superstore changes their description, I will stand by my 1 star rating! …",45 out of 66 users found this review helpful
 A little secret/new product idea,4,"Previously to receiving this system, hubby and I were attempting to train our 2 young kitties to use a human toilet, to no avail. I learned about this system and decided to give it a try, thinking I'd buy some reusable training pads instead of the ones made for this system (which were more than I wanted to pay). That way we would be able to save some money and the earth a little bit as well. Then, I realized I could potentially skip the pee pads entirely and just replace our toilet training system with the Breeze litter box...on top of the toilet, sans tray (and toilet seat/lid/mounting parts). This is exactly what I did this morning when I received the system, and the kitties were ecstatic not to have to use the wretched toilet training system anymore. They took to it immediately... probably because they were glad to go back to a litter box and also because we had been using Feline Pine with them, so they were used to pellet-type litter. So we're all happy... the kitties are peeing in the toilet, although they don't know it, and all we have to do is scoop the poo, which doesn't smell as bad when the kitties bury it. I was really hoping they would be able to use the toilet on their own, but I think we've reached a pretty good compromise. I did have to cover up part of the grid with some clear mailing tape, however, because the corners of the rectangle grid did not quite fit over the oval toilet bowl. Had to clean up a puddle of piddle after I realized I had miscalculated. :P All that being said, it would be great if a company came out with a Breeze-like system made for toilets. That would be AWESOME... *nudge nudge to the litter companies* …",27 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 Amazingly Lifelike,4,"I grew up in a diabetic household so I have always been aware of the difference between ""people"" food and ""diabetic"" food. Of course it was only recently that I was put on the non-people stuff exclusively. These candies are surprisingly satisfying. I have a doc who says artificial sweeteners are for those who haven't yet admitted that they aren't allowed to have a sweet tooth any longer. May be true but these little candies are quite nice. They are, in fact, hard. That is a nice change from diabetic candies when I was a child. They have a decent mouth feel and an almost caramel taste. I don't catch an aftertaste. So, when I ""need"" a fix, these are nice to have around the house. Won't mistake them for ""people"" candy but these really are amazingly lifelike. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" "" A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!""",5,"I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try ""Natural Calm""; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot. I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because ""Natural Calm"" does the job. I've been taking ""Natural Calm"" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff. As for negatives to ""Natural Calm""...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick. All in all 5+ stars. ""Natural Calm"" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer. …",39 out of 47 users found this review helpful

However, they are a decidedly poor alternative for travels, since most of the outer coating of the fruit turns into very messy powder. The strawberry flavor is slightly less of an ordeal in that regards but still messy. They are probably good for you if you want a stowaway fruit you can use when you haven't gotten to the store for awhile or want it out of season to sprinkle into something, but otherwise the price and messiness are both much too prohibitive.

We have a white machine in our laundryroom & then bought my husband a black one for work. Soooooooo I guess you could say we looooooove this coffee/method of making it, & medium roast is the best. I recently saw Douwe Egberts non-pod coffee @ a local gourmet shop & it was like $9 something for 12oz! Good to know one can get the coffee to use in a regular drip pot as well, however, @ that price, I guess we will just continue to have this as ""treat coffee"" via our machine. All this being said, I would like to say that @ both Target & Walmart here in Buffalo, NY area stores, I can get the pods for $4.24 each. However, when Target in particular, wants to rotate stock, they mark it down to the wonderful price of $4!!!!! Needless to say, I buy them out, go to another store & do the same. That's almost $4 less for 6 bags than Superstore sells it for!!!! I encourage all of you Senseoholics to do the same & check out the above mentioned stores.

These, however, were merely tossed in the box with my other items, and arrived half-melted -- they all oozed into the cracks and crevices of their wrappers, making them both difficult and messy to unwrap. I'd be even MORE annoyed if I'd planned to use them for anything other than personal consumption, as they're in no condition to be handed out for any reason.

" Great Coffee Flavor, Bad Quality K-Cups",2,"This has been my favorite K-Cup coffee for well over 9 months now, so I was very excited to be able to buy it on Superstore in large quantities at a reduced cost. Unfortunately, while the flavor is still my favorite, I've had terrible luck with the K-Cups themselves. Every second or third cup I brew leaves loads of coffee grounds in the cup. I've had this happen on occasion with other K-Cups over the two years I've owned my Keurig, but NEVER to this extent. I don't know if the foil cap is the cause of the problem or what, but it appears that every time the pin punctures the K-Cup it leaves a much larger than normal hole that causes the grounds to end up in the coffee. At first I thought maybe it was a problem with my brewer, but I've used 4 other varieties since the problem began and I've had zero issues with those. Obviously it's a issue with this particular product. …",18 out of 20 users found this review helpful

" great for the colon, not so great for your taste buds...",2,"the fiber content of this ""powder"" is amazing but the the taste and texture are almost unbearable. while hemp is not going to taste as good (by good taste-i mean an absence of taste) as soy or whey, it should at least be better than this. my gripes: texture- this product should not be called a powder at all. it's more like the contents of a tea bag. the product should be more finely ground. taste- this hemp has a stronger taste than other brands i have tried. i haven't found anything that really goes well with the ""earthy"" taste. the good news: fiber-i believe one serving provides 54% of the DV. that's 2-4 times as much as other hemp powders. this is why i gave this product 2 stars instead of one. the good news about all hemp: it's not highly processed like whey, soy, rice or other protein powders. it's organic. most hemp powders are organic because hemp is naturally resistant to pests. ever wonder why you never see organic soy protein? hexane. this is the chemical (similar to gasoline) that must be used to isolate the protein from the bean. it's raw. yay! other brands: i have tried nutiva, ruth's and living harvest. i currently use and recommend living harvest. it has the best consistency and taste. ruth's contains slightly more vitamins than living harvest but has a slightly stronger taste. nutiva is by far the worst with the strongest taste, grainiest texture and least vitamins. i find that the best recipe for a hemp smoothie is just a frozen ripe banana (use one with lot's of brown freckles-it may be a little gooey going into the freezer but as with banana bread, those bananas have the best taste), 2-3 drops of vanilla extract, some soy or almond milk and a scoop of hemp. hemp doesn't really seem to agree with berries or non-creamy fruits. bottom line-unless fiber is your #1 concern, go with another brand. …",66 out of 70 users found this review helpful

In other words -- nearly impossible. But lord help me, I try. I bought a bag of these biscuits, thinking I could coax the mutt into good behavior through 'positive reinforcement'. Though the idea sort of fizzles when the dog is too finicky to eat the stupid things. She gave the tiniest of disinterested exploratory sniffs, then scrunched her furry little schnozz like I was offering her a handful of barf-encrusted ****. (Which, based on her previous dietary choices, she would actually eat. Tasty baked tidbit? No, thanks; I'm trying to keep my greyhoundish figure. The poop du jour in half-digested BLEEEH-rnaise sauce? Mmmm-mmmm! Bon appeturd!) I tried to entice her, but she wasn't having it. I even tried a little nibble myself, to prove I wasn't trying to poison her. (Yet.) And actually, the biscuit was pretty good. It's got a nice crunch, with a taste somewhere between a heavy water cracker and reconstituted horse meal. But pretty light on the 'horse meal' part. All in all, not bad. I'd give it about a four on the people-food scale -- somewhere between a stale bag of Funyuns and a plain rice cake eaten off a sweaty Clydesdale's back. I finished the first one and had another. Pretty soon I'd gone through half the bag. So this was a complete waste for the dog. But I found a new snack for TV nights. Now if I'm out of popcorn, I set out a bowl of biscuits and munch away. They're not gourmet. But they're filling, and I'm getting my recommended daily allowance of hoof meat all in one sitting. That's a winner. …",9 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Fine Brandy + Rich Dark Chocolate = A Decadent Delight!,5,"A German friend, returning to his home in New York City after visiting with family in Frankfurt am Main, brought me back a gift box of ASBACH URALT Assorted Brandy-Filled Chocolates. That was about six years ago and I have been hooked ever since. I have tasted chocolates filled with liquor before, but the contents usually taste like alcohol, (the rubbing variety), made palatable only by the candy covering. For that reason I preferred my occasional after-dinner brandy in a snifter. Now, Asbach Uralt, which is recognized by connoisseurs to be the ultimate in liquor-filled chocolate, allows me to have my dessert along with a small taste of superb cognac in one bite. Actually, it is more like one long savoring session between me and a piece of chocolate. Hugo Asbach's company has been producing fine cognac, ""Weinbrand,"" since 1907 and it is this excellent brandy that is used to make the unique gourmet confection. A thin sugar crust separates the rich dark chocolate and the fine Uralt Asbach Brandy. It is important that the candy be consumed while fresh so the alcohol does not evaporate, and the middleman who sells this product through Superstore has consistently provided me with chocolates as fresh as I would get in Germany. I have ordered frequently over the years, for myself and for friends, as this makes a delicious and unusual gift. The Large Asbach Assorted Gift Box contains a variety of the liquor-filled chocolates. The assortment includes cherries marinated for over a year in Asbach brandy, praline, coffee and pure cognac. The chocolates are as fine as any I have had in Belgium and much less expensive. This is a real winner. 5+ Stars! JANA …",21 out of 22 users found this review helpful

I was pumping about 2-3 ounces at a time, but if he took a bottle of expressed milk, he would end up eating 4-5 ounces. After the first day of drinking this tea 3 times, I was able to pump at least 5 ounces, if not 6.

 Not the best,4,"I could not figure out what the difference was between this product and the one I have been using. This comes in a 16 oz. plastic jar, mine comes in 14 oz jar. this one is less expensive, that is where I get nervous. So I examined both jars, this one has 10 more calories than mine for each tablespoon. This one has 13 grams of saturated fats and mine has 12. None of these is a problem ans is well within range, then I noticed this one can be cooked up to 350 degrees. Mine can be cooked no higher than 280, this means that this one is refined, mine is unrefined, this one is more processed. Not what I want. I am sure it is not a huge deal but I want the best I can get. With all that said, I really cannot taste a very big difference between the two, I did a side by side taste and texture taste and they are close to being identical. There is a lovely coconut flavor and a nice oil taste. The coconut did not overpower the foods in my recipes which I thought it would. I used it on my face hair and body. It is cooling and smooth, it does take a little time to soak in so I use it at night and in the morning I feel silky smooth. It has not clogged my pores so I wake up and there are not blemishes. It is also extremely good for your pets, cats dogs and birds. My dog absolutely loves this but be careful you must start by giving a very small amount (1/4 tsp.)and build it up to a tsp. per 20 lbs. of animal over a month. If you are not careful they will suffer from die back. Google that, you may see Herxheimer's reaction, it is about the same thing and happens to humans also. I had it once it is not pretty, although it is very good sign in the long run. I like this product but I will stick to my unrefined brand. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful

The flavor is authentic, rich, smooth, complex and spicy, yet only mildly warm. (And, no, I am not one of those lunatics that says something ""isn't hot"" unless it has 500,000 heat units.) All but the very faintest of heart can handle this stuff. Williams chili powder is almost identical to ""Grandma's Spanish Seasoning"", which my family used for years in various favorites. I was crushed when Grandma's went out of business and thrilled when I found out that Williams had bought them out. I tracked them down on the web and Williams graciously sent me a sample packet of their chili seasoning. YOWZA!!! If anything, it is even better than Grandma's.

 Decent quality but a few shortcomings,3,"This is a nice quality cup and infuser -- it's sturdy and comfortable. The infuser is resistant to staining and the little lid that is used to keep the heat in when steeping can be turned upside-down to act as a holder for the wet infuser when you remove it from the tea. However, there are some problems. My main complaint is the design of the infuser. The sides are a nice, fine mesh whereas the bottom is plastic with some perforations. These holes in the bottom allow small leaf bits to flow-out. I have a Teeli infuser that has the mesh in the bottom also and it keeps all of the leaves contained. Second, and far more minor, the cup is rather small. It makes a nicely sized cup of tea, but if you're used to drinking from larger cups and mugs, you will find yourself gulping this one down pretty quickly. Overall, this is not a bad product and if it had the full mesh infuser, I would have given it 4 stars. …",32 out of 33 users found this review helpful

As far as we're concerned, it's a perfectly fine product. The reason I'm giving this only ONE star is because of the ridiculous price.

I live in downtown Seattle where prices are generally a little higher than most places and even I can go to my local store and buy this same size tub for about $20/tub.

 Bread from a tin can?  Preposterous!,4,"Bread in a can? Sounds positively revolting right? Not so fast. The Burnham & Morrill Co. of Portland, Maine has been in the canning business for more than a century now. These are the folks who bring you that staple of millions of American households--B & M Original Baked Beans. But the folks at B & M also produce a companion product of old New England-B&M Brown Bread. This is an item that most Americans have probably never sampled or for that matter ever even heard of. When you pop open a can of B & M Brown Bread (which is steam cooked right in the can!) I will be the first to admit that it does not appear to be particularly appetizing. But looks are deceiving. B & M Brown Bread has been a popular item around these parts for generations. For lots of New England families the tradition of having baked beans and brown bread for supper on Saturday continues to this day. Many of us grew up with beans and franks and brown bread on Saturday nights. This is just the kind of rib-sticking, intensely flavored food that we crave around here, particularly on a cold, blustery night. Legend has it that brown bread is closely related to an earlier bread known as ""rye and Indian"" (from ""Indian"" cornmeal) or ""thirded"" bread from its use of rye, cornmeal, and wheat flours. Now you might surmise that bread that is actually cooked in a can would be full of preservatives. This is simply not the case. Despite its downright creepy appearance B&M canned bread is actually about as natural as anything out there. The ingredients listed on the can include water, whole wheat flour, molasses, dextrose, rye flour, whey, corn meal, baking soda, buttermilk, salt and corn oil. Compare that to all of the junk found in your favorite snack food! What's more, B & M Brown Bread tastes great! B & M Brown Bread comes in two delicious varieties--Original and with Raisin. I love them both but am partial to the raisin. Brown bread is not something I purchase very often these days but when I do it is a real treat. Just heat and serve! B & M Brown Bread is great just as is or with some butter and really is the perfect accompaniment to a franks and beans or ham and bean supper. Try it sometime! Now I am not really sure if you can even find B & M Brown Bread everywhere in the country. It's great to see that it is available through Superstore. Around here it sells for about $2.00 a can. What prompted me to write this review is that I saw this product advertised in a catalogue for $8.50. Such a deal! The catalogue describes the taste of B & M Brown Bread this way; ""Extremely moist and dense, this New England treat is made using only natural ingredients and has a rich molasses taste that comes through with every bite"". I would concur. So go ahead. Be brave. For a taste sensation just a tad bit out of the ordinary I recommend that you give this all-time New England favorite a try. Highly recommended! …",21 out of 24 users found this review helpful

" Excellent Peas, Very Hot, Do Not Serve to Newborn Babies",5,"Hapi's Hot Wasabi Green Peas are a terrific replacement for granola! I eat a bowlful every morning with ketchup, green tea and scallions. Yummy! I tried rolling up the peas in an omlet and served it to my wife on our 75th anniversary. This was just my way of expressing my affection for her. Somehow she missed my sincere intentions and barfed all over my grandmother's antique quilt. Then our Irish Wolfhound jumped up on the bed, licked up the disgusting mess and yelped so loud that 3 of my goldfish jumped out of their bowl and were eaten by my cat. At least someone got a good meal from all my hard work. I had some small success passing out single peas to the neighborhood kids, telling them that they were a new flavor of M&Ms. Their parents really have no gripe with me, but I explained it all to the police. They could not find any violation of law, so I was released without charges. I did feel a bit ripped off by the 9.9 oz. packaging as I had expected a full 10 oz. bottle. After carefully counting all the peas I determined that 4 additional peas would make up the missing 1/10 ounce (yes, I did the math). So I called customer service, told them how unhappy I was and asked them to send me 4 additional peas. She was polite, but said no, claiming that they wouldn't have a pod to pea in. Whatever. These are really nice peas -- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! …",11 out of 21 users found this review helpful
" No hydrogenated oils, but too sweet",4,"I love that this is a no-stir option without hydrogenated oils. I really hate stirring natural peanut butter. Plus, oily peanut butter - yuck! My only issue is that it's far too sweet. I got used to peanut butter without sugar. I also think the company is being a little deceptive. They say that there's ""no added sugar,"" but then admit in the description that there's cane juice. The carb count, for anyone who's interested, is 8 grams (3 grams of which are sugar) per 2 tablespoons. Whether it's cane juice or sugar or corn syrup, it's really all sugar. Because of the over-sweetening and higher carb count, I probably won't be ordering from this company again, but if they ever make a no-stir peanut butter without any kind of sugar, I'll be the first in line. Fortunately, I was able to turn the peanut butter into low-carb peanut butter cookies. The sweetness doesn't bother me as much in cookie form. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Smells Great; Makes Things Taste Great,5,"Several years ago, I started making homemade marshmallows for family and friends. You'd be amazed at the simple joy that radiates from the face of a person learning for the first time that marshmallows can be made at home. Anyway, as a special treat for a friend who is so enamored with France that she grows French lavender in her backyard because it reminds her of her travels there, I decided to try a lavender marshmallow. I was able to find some culinary lavender in my local grocery store (near a pretty urban area), but it seemed so expensive. In the end, this is about a fifth of the price of my grocery store. Win! When I got the package in the mail, I could smell the floral, almost woodsy and astringent fragrance that I associate with lavender (and rosemary) before even opening it. The color of the flower buds ranged from shades of blue to purple. To cook with it, I dump what I need into a large bowl and use the sprayer on my faucet to put enough water in the bowl so that the flowers float. I give it a stir and then use a small-gauge strainer to scrape the floating flowers out of the water. Any detritus that may be mixed in with the flowers will sink to the bottom (though any stems will not - but then again, rosemary and thyme typically have some stems mixed in), so don't just dump it in the strainer. Glean the flowers from the top of the bowl. As for my marshmallows, which I topped with lavender-scented dark chocolate, my friend loved them and everything I've made since (lavender lemon cookies, blueberry lavender syrup, lavender cream, lavender, thyme, and rosemary roasted potatoes, lavender butter, strawberry lavender butter, etc.) has been quite delicious. When I need more lavender, I know where to come. Update: I also wanted to mention that 1 oz. of lavender is about 1.25 cups. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Banana bread brownie?,5,"Wow, I just had my first Larabar today after a long run, and I have been blown away. As of late my preference has been for protein bars, but I had picked up a Larabar a few months ago just because it looked interesting. I tried the ""banana cookie dough"" flavor, since I'm a banana nut. Unwrapping the package was difficult, though I've since found out that they have a multi-layer wrapper because there are no preservatives. Once open, I was confronted with a raw looking rectangle of brown with pale chunks in it. It looked moist and smelled phenomenal. The first bite made me think ""banana bread"", and as I ate the rest of the bar I decided it wasn't quite like banana bread, but closer to that than a ""cookie"", in any case. The pale chunks were the #1 ingredient - almonds. The #2 and #3 ingredients were dates and bananas, respectively. The #4 ingredient was.... nothing. There are only 3 ingredients. I actually flipped the wrapper over to see the continuation of the ingredients list before I realized that there was no more list! These bars are a little expensive for a non-protein energy bar, but the taste is like nothing you would expect from a brown rectangular smashed together food thing. Its simply incredible, and now I have to go back and purchase the other flavors to try them out, too. …",21 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Nice tasty tea!,4,"This coca leaf tea has a robust flavor, far more so than I anticipated. Not bitter, just richer and fuller than most teas I have had. It has a very mild stimulating effect, somewhere in between coffee and regular tea. However, it is far more soothing than coffee; no jitters or shakiness. I began having it in the mornings at work, and found it gave me the energy that I rely on coffee for, without feeling wired or sped up. I can see why coca is so sacred to the Peruvians; there is a definite medicinal quality to it. Not in flavor, just in how it effects the body. Overall, I would say that tea drinkers (or coffee addicts looking to get off the Bean) should give this a try. Tastes great, and does wake you up a bit. I recommend! …",21 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 I'm a Believer,5,"Everyone knows the old saying: ""A box on the table keeps my jimmies stable."" But is that just more of an old wives tale, or does this archaic rhyme actually hold some truth to it? I, like many others, had a tough time making it through the day. I would drag myself out of bed at 7'oclock, and sigh as I began my daily routine. Shave, shower, put on my suit, hastily eat a bowl of Cheerios, and then hurry out the door. That's when I would begin to feel my jimmies being rustled. Sitting there, stuck in traffic, as a BMW cuts me off. I finally pull into the parking lot, and somebody has stolen my usual parking spot. My jimmies become rustled even further. I get into the office, head to the break room to get a cup of coffee, and there's nothing left in the pot. It's only 9'oclock in the morning, and already my jimmies have been extremely rustled. By that point I figure my jimmies cannot be rustled even further, when my boss comes in and yells at me for only working 12 hours yesterday. What he doesn't know is how late I stayed up working my *ss off for him, only to have my wife walk in on me making cereal at 4'oclock in the morning. She asked me, with stress in her voice, what I was doing up that late and I reluctantly replied, ""because I've lost control of my jimmies..."" By lunch time, where they're always out of hamburgers, my jimmies lay on their deathbeds from the constant rustling. I didn't think there was anything I could do. I had come to accept the fact that my jimmies may be eternally rustled, a condition my physician diagnosed as Rustled Jimmie Syndrome, or RJS. I looked on the internet for answers, but it seemed like nobody knew how I could keep my jimmies unrustled. Finally, somebody contacted me with a tip: ""There is no need to be upset, try the cereal Gorilla Munch. A box on the table will keep your jimmies stable."" At that point, I was willing to try anything. I rushed to Whole Foods and found a box of Gorilla Munch. Even after just looking at the box, I could begin to feel my jimmies becoming unrustled. The gorilla on the front had such a calm look to him. I got home a placed the box on my kitchen table. That gorilla on the box seemed to stare in to my soul, as if trying to hush me, and plead with me, ""Shh, no tears. Only dreams now."" After my first bite of the delicious cereal, I could tell my jimmies were heading back to a peaceful, unrustled state. The next morning I went through my normal routine, but this time, I munched on breakfast with my new gorilla friend and his amazing cereal. The world seemed brighter, as if that gorilla's laid-back, calming attitude had pulled a golden blanket of deliciousness over my jimmies and tucked them into bed. Suddenly, being cut-off didn't rustle my jimmies. They were no longer rustled by having my parking spot stolen, or even there being no hamburgers left at lunch. Even after a yelling from my boss, my jimmies remained unrustled. I cannot recommend Gorilla Munch any more highly. I'm a new person. You cannot even imagine how unrustled my jimmies are. …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 Go for the burn!,5,"You are probably asking, ""Why would you review Diet Coke?"" It's a **** soda. It costs almost nothing! We've all had it and are probably already addicted and strung out to D.C. Well, the truth is that I am a true Coke connoisseur. I have spent many hours discussing a good coca-cola versus a **** coca-cola. This is a drink that can draw out the flavors of a good meal, just like a fine bottle of wine or cold glass of milk. Originally I only drank regular Coke. But there is no need to have all that high fructose corn syrup. It will ultimately lead to your demise. So make the switch to Diet Coke. You may need to do some 50/50 blends for a while, but in a couple of weeks you won't go back to regular Coke (it tastes way too sugary now). In general, any soda from a can actually can taste pretty bad due to changes in carbonation, flavor of the can, etc. But a soda from a bottle (glass or plastic) is the best. You know the batch is good when there is a major burn in your mouth after a big gulp. Pepsi won't do this the same, the pH is different and it has a different sugar content. Diet Coke has the perfect burn. Fountain soda almost universally sucks, so don't even go there. I recommend that D.C. accompany any rich, flavorful meal. It may overpower meals that have subtle flavors (for example, some French cuisine is quite subtle in flavor to me, and D.C. may wash it away). You already know D.C. will enhance the flavors of beef, fried food, pizza, potato chips (and most other snacks), most sandwiches, Italian foods of almost any variety, and greasy chili cheese dogs. So go buy a 2 liter, chill (4 degrees celsius at the lowest, preferably a degree or two warmer), go work off all that high fructose corn syrup you ate earlier in the day, and then getcha pull of D.C. If you don't like my review, you must be a Pepsi fan. So be it. Your teeth will rot sooner, it's got a lower pH. …",7 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" Alert -- this is designed for fountain drinks, not for plain milk",5,"This is a tasty product, but I want to alert other malted milk lovers that this is not suitable for simply stirring into a glass of milk with a spoon. It does not dissolve as well as the Carnation/Nestle malted milk powder. It is perfect for drinks where you are using a blender to mix everything together, but if you just stir it with a spoon you will end up with malt powder floating on top of your drink. As far as taste, I think it does taste richer and more genuinely ""malty"" than the Carnation/Nestle product. There's a kind of bread/beer/bakery overtone in the flavor that makes it taste more old fashioned. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

" Not exactly like traditional potato chips, but a great substitute",5,"One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips. I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips. In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip. This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind. I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco. I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area. Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any. I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Superstore in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me. They are definitely worth the money. I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips. The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips. I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do. Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them. As for the portion size, it's pretty generous. For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors. I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next. …",73 out of 77 users found this review helpful

 A tasty treat with omega-3s for all,5,"Because I'm a vegetarian it's a little tricky getting those highly touted omega-3s in my diet so I'm always happy to find food source that does the job. This tasty granola contains flax seeds (hence the omega-3s) and a veritable cornucopia of whole grains including amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet, brown rice and buckwheat, but no wheat so it's gluten-free. It's sweet, but not too sweet. It does have evaporated cane juice and molasses, but a one third cup serving only has 6 grams of sugar. That same serving size has 5 grams of fiber, 3 grams of protein, 130 calories and only 3.5 grams of fat and 20 mg of sodium so unless you overdo it, and because it is delicious that's possible, it's a guilt-free food. It's great straight out of the bag, or with milk or (my favorite) yogurt. There are several other flavors and they all sound good so I know I'll be checking them out too.

 This filter works PERFECT!,5,"Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the ""old fashion way"" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size. I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Superstore, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry. The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I.

" Finally, an affordable, delicious green tea powder",5,"I love drinking green tea. It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key. So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US. In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews. Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping. I was pleasantly surprised. The product works as advertised. It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too. The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.

 America's Favorite Cake!,5,"It must be true because it says so on the package: ""America's Favorite Cake."" I seem to remember a check box on the 2010 Census regarding cake preference, but I don't think I voted for Yellow Cake. I would have voted for Devil's Food Cake, although it may be politically incorrect these days to mention, you know, The Devil, so I may have voted for German Chocolate Cake, but Germany is, you know, the Old Europe, so I may have voted for a chocolate cupcake. But without peanuts because so many people are now allergic to peanuts that they can't even serve 0.5 grams of salted nuts on airplanes. Sigh. Where was I? Hmmm? Oh, yes.... I certainly would vote for Duncan Hines cake but I feel it should be mentioned that this is not cake.....yet. This is cake mix. Its sort of a cake fetus, or a cake stem cell. It still needs lots of development. You have to add additional ingredients and warmth and time to develop the mix into a cake. There is the promise of cake, but unless you follow the protocol written on the box very carefully, you may not get cake. Depending on what you do, you may get something very odd and rubbery or something very dark and charred. It's complicated! Superstore has allowed third-party vendors to offer Duncan Hines Cake Mixes for sale for quite some time. An example of this is: Hines Classic Yellow Layer Cake Mix 18.25 oz - 6 Unit Pack . Superstore, being a very clever retailer, has obviously read the numerous, highly enthusiastic customer reviews for this product, and has now started selling these products directly to its customers, so many of whom must be begging for a six pack of a product readily available in any supermarket or convenience store. In order to enhance customer demand, Superstore's copywriters have outdone themselves listing this product's outstanding features: -Pack of six, 16.5 18.25 ounces each (now 1.75 oz. lighter!) -The moistest, most delicious -A special treat for the special people Of course, ""the special people"" must be those who voted for Duncan Hines Yellow Cake Mix. That's why it's ""America's Favorite Cake"". Makes perfect sense. This is a Democracy! This is a great country and this is great cake mix! Another thing you should know is that you get six boxes of cake mix. This is enough mix to incubate a very, very big sheet cake that would require a very, very large incubator or oven. You could also prepare a tall 12 layer cake which would kind of look like a miniature version of the Coit Tower in San Francisco. Certainly enough ""the moistest, most delicious"" yellow cake for a very large number of ""the special people"". Finally, a charming aspect is that on the very same page as this product, Superstore suggests ""Customers Who Bought This Product Also Bought"": Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes, Refills, Case of 4 / 84s (336 ct). Obviously, ""the special people"" anticipate getting down with this cake. Six boxes of cake mix is bound to make a mess in the kitchen and later on, there will be cake crumbs on lips and chins and fingers. A few Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes could come in handy! Smart! …",11 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Tea For A Tea Drinker,4,"I'm one of those people that drinks a lot of tea. Expensive and inexpensive. This is a less expensive every day tea. It's not fancy, but it is above average. Strong flavored that will stand up to milk and sugar if you like. Think Irish breakfast commercial blends and you have an idea of the typical flavor. If you're a tea drinker, think a Anhui Province medium grade Chuen Cha. Overall a great bang for your buck if you are a tea drinker who isn't afraid of loose leaf preparations. The packaging concerns are pretty groundless. If you're drinking loose leaf tea, odds are you have a few jars or air tight tea containers. The packaging itself is good, eco-friendly, seals well but you might want to put half (or more) into a air tight container then use the stuff left in the bag first. This way you will avoid any flavor degradation when at the bottom of the bag from oxidation over time, if you don't use this tea daily or regular like. It is not a first flush premier estate tea. It is splendid tasting and a great value. Eco-friendly and organic are just valuable perks to the world conscious. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 The ONLY way to make coffee,5,"I use the Natural Brown, 2 cup Melitta filter paper and a Melitta cone to make the best coffee this side of anywhere. Of course, it is necessary to use the best coffee, and that can only be found at Peet's. The coffee must be ground very fine, and since I like strong coffee, I use two scoops to make one cup. OK, here's the rest of the drill: First insert the filter paper in the cone, position it over the cup and fill with hot water. The hot water rinses the filter and preheats the cup. Next, add two scoops (or one and a half if you like your coffee weaker)and lightly tamp it down to pack it but do not tear the filter. Pour the hot water out of the cup. Replace the filter and coffee over the cup and add a small amount of hot water, wetting the grounds. DO NOT USE BOILING HOT WATER! Boiling hot water dissolves acids and makes the coffee bitter. The water temperature should be about 180 to 190 Fahrenheidt. After the first bit of water had drained into the cup, add more water. Even if you have been used to adding sugar to your coffee, please try it without. There will be no bitterness and in fact, you can make the coffee stronger than you ever imagined and there'll be no bitterness. You are welcome! …",16 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 Changed Formula,2,"These were a staple for my gluten-free teenager until a few months ago when she started complaining that they tasted different, not in a good way.

 I have a solution to the black mold problem in the Beaba!,3,"Like most of you, I noticed the black mold problem and was horrified. I tried the vinegar solution to no avail. Then, I got to thinking....Why not try CLR! CLR is a green solution to rid your home or coffeemaker of calcium, lime or rust. I figured if it is safe to use in a coffeemaker then, why not give it a try! It WORKED!! I put in about a 1/2 cup of the product (undiluted)into the water reservoir, let it sit a few minutes and THEN scrubbed the inside with a toothbrush. Keeping the CLR in the reservoir, I ran the unit to steam, the black mold particles started pouring out. Then, I ran it several times with plain water. Particles kept coming. I took a look inside with a flashlight and after a few more touch ups with the toothbrush, the reservoir looked BRAND NEW. For safe keeping I ran it again with more fresh water. In the future, whenever you use your baby food maker, I would recommend emptying out the residual water (this is what caused the mold problem in the first place) then re-attaching the food basket/processor/bowl with the lid on and running the steamer with the LID OFF. You will be able to see the water bubbling, turning to vapor and then the reservoir will be completely dry. This step is KEY as you want to will ensure that your water reservoir is completely dry while you store it. Once this is done, you can re-attach the lid. It's also a good idea that you make sure your food basket/processor/bowl is dry as well. Hope this helps! …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Healthy Tea Supports Weight Control,5,"***** This Fasting Tea from Yogi Tea for Weight Loss Support is ""designed to promote healthy functioning of the stomach and intestines, and to help you feel more energetic while you lose weight."" Fasting Tea is based on an Ayurvedic formula---Ayurveda is an Indian form of health care now also becoming popular in the United States. It's suggested that you drink Fasting Tea 15 minutes before eating. I have done this, and it does really seem to help, although I'm not quite sure if the effect is physiological or psychological. Oh, well, I don't care, since it helps me to be in control of my eating. It has a sweet and pleasing taste, and is quite enjoyable to sip on while others are filling up on bread, appetizers, and high-calorie drinks and alcohol. I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Fasting Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Fasting is made with organic Red Clover and Garcinia Fruit designed to help support a healthy weight loss program, as it aids digestive functions, supports the metabolism and encourages internal cleansing. The tea includes hydroxy-citric acid that is found in the Garcinia Fruit, native to Southeast Asia. This naturally occurring substance has been shown to simultaneously suppress the appetite, help reduce fats and cholesterol in the liver and disrupt the process by which the body stores excess calories as fat. We have also included the warming herbs Fennel Seed, Cinnamon Bark and Black Pepper to help promote circulation, as well as Red Clover, which works as a tonic and a blood purifier. The recipe is complimented with Alfalfa Leaf, Indian Bacopa Leaf (Gotu Kola), and English Hawthorn Berry, all of which can aid the body in the elimination of wastes that are known to slow the metabolism. Finally, we've included Burdock, Dandelion and Yellow Dock Roots, all used by European herbalists for centuries to support the liver in eliminating toxins."" Other ingredients in this tea are Licorice Root, Alfalfa Leaf, Cardamom Seed, Ginger Root, Clove Bud, Barley Malt, Date Powder, Natural Plum Flavor, and Natural Passion Fruit Flavor. Almost every ingredient in this tea is also organic. There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Fasting Tea contains no caffeine whatsoever. It steeps for 5-10 minutes, a nice long time, but I find that I only need one tea bag instead of two for a wonderful flavor. I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting. Highly Recommended. ***** …",22 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 First Rate Blend.,5,"I really enjoy coffee, and I have ever since my teenage years. My tastes have gradually evolved and escalated. The first to go was any kind of instant coffee. How anyone could drink that swill is beyond me. Next to go was any kind of additive, such as cream or sugar. The next to go was any kind of ground coffee in a can. Some is marginally OK, but compared to whole-bean coffee, it just doesn't cut it. No, whole-bean coffee without any additives and ground on the spot is the only coffee I'll drink, short of some kind of emergency. When It comes to whole-bean coffees, there's quite an amazing variety. I found Trader Joe's to have an excellent selection from all over the world, and the cost (on a per pound basis) was typically about 50% that of what you might expect to pay in the local super market. I particularly liked their Columbian Supremo. The problem is, the local Trader Joe""s is a long way off and I sometimes run out between visits. Well, I've then picked up some large bags of beans, one of which was Starbucks French Roast, at my local Costco store and it was quite excellent. Starbucks is first rate, but tends to be somewhat pricey, even when purchased at Costco. Well, one day I discovered the Kirkland Signature House Blend bags of whole-bean coffee at Costco. In my opinion, Kirkland Signature products have always been of the highest quality but at a substantially reduced price. For example, this Kirkland coffee is almost half the cost (on a per pound basis) of Starbucks French Roast. But, right on the front of the Kirkland package it says ""Roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co."" Hmmmm. I just had to try this one. Well, it's excellent. It's a little less robust than my Starbucks French Roast, but I prefer it that way. I'd say it's first rate coffee at a bargain basement price. Buying whole-bean coffee at the local supermarket is now out of the question. Gary Peterson …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Excellent Source of Magnesium,5,"If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too. I've also tried a flavored version of this product (Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder). Unlike that version, this stuff is entirely odorless, and the only taste is a sense of tartness. I much prefer this non-flavored version over the flavored version. The only problem I have with this product is that it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage. That's pretty insignificant. So, I still rate it at an Excellent five stars out of five. Highly recommended. Especially if you're taking calcium. …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 My favorite mix so far,4,"This is my favorite gluten free pizza mix so far. I prefer thinner crusts (almost the cracker crisp type crust), but I'll probably never achieve that with gluten free pizza. This is the closest thing I've found, however. I had to experiment a bit to get it right. This mix makes TWO pizzas, and I use a very large 14"" pan (actually, closer to 16 inches when you include the edges, which curve upwards.) If you were using a much smaller pizza pan, you might get 3 pizzas out of the mix. I do the mix exactly as per the instructions, let it rise the recommended 30 minutes, THEN I divide the dough into two equal parts. One part I usually save and refrigerate (in a bowl and topped tightly with either foil or saran wrap) and I've used it up to two or three days later with perfect results. Then the other half I'll use the day I make it, since I usually only want to do one at a time. After the dough has risen (it only seems to rise slightly) , I grease the pizza pan using Crisco...my preference, and I like the results better. I don't roll it out. Rather, I put the blob of dough in the center, and use my hands to punch it down and push it outwards around the pan, bit by bit. So my hands don't stick to the dough too much, I use a gluten free flour mix such as the Amy's baking mix on my hands as much as needed, so probably a bit of this will get worked in as I spread the dough out in the pan. The dough would be impossible to roll out in my opinion, or at least, I don't want to mess with it due to the relative stickiness of the dough. After the dough is all evenly spread thru the pan and with a bit of an edge, I poke some fork holes around the bottom here and there. Then I bake the bare crust for about 10 to 12 minutes in the oven at 425...it will be faintly starting to brown at this point. This pre-cooking is important for gluten free crusts! Remove from oven, let it cool about 5 minutes, then put on your desired toppings. With everything on, it goes back into the oven for less than 10 minutes...just to heat everything up and melt the cheese, basically. The crust will brown a bit more in the process. Even done in such a large pan, the crust isn't as thin as you'd expect, but you avoid the soggy bottom so common to GF crusts. My whole family loves this pizza and the wheat eaters of the family don't really notice or care about the difference in the crust. The taste is quite nice, it has that usual yeast flavor of a wheat crust, and there are no weird rice flour tastes at all. If anything, it's somewhat bland, but that's probably a good thing for a gluten free crust. …",108 out of 108 users found this review helpful

 Fatal Flavor Flaw,1,"Roland Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce have a strange and unpleasant, vaguely chemical taste that is hard to describe, slightly metallic, perhaps an artificial smoke flavor or dried spices. Roland doesn't generally manufacture their own products but private-labels those from other manufacturers and I have to wonder who cans these. Other brands that I have tried like San Marcos and Casa Fiesta are much better and cleaner tasting. My advice is to buy one of those brands or at least try one can before committing to a case of these if you haven't tasted them. Besides this fatal flavor flaw they are pretty much the same as any other chipotle in adobo, nice whole peppers swimming in sauce, smoky and addictive to people who like to eat hot peppers. They will squirt when you bite them so I usually cut them in half in the kitchen. Bottom line, I have been using them in recipes where they lend heat and the flavor will be buried but I can't eat them with chips or use them as a sauce on top of anything because of the flavor and I won't be ordering them again. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 I know my mac & cheez,5,"The Annie's product compares favorable to Kraft Mac & Cheese. I just can't let stand some mis-information comparing the two. One correction needed is ""I love mac and cheese and I know how to make it. -- The cheese powder doesn't dissolve entirely, and it tends to stick to the pasta in dry little clumps rather than blend into an actual sauce."" But if the preparation instructions are followed this is nearly impossible to happen. On the other hand, if one were to improperly prepare the Annie's product (for example using the Kraft preparation instructions), then this is exactly what you could get - clumps! The Annie product preparation instruction state to put 2-4 tablespoons of skim milk + the cheese sauce mix into the warm empty pot and wisk well until SMOOTH, and only then to add the cooked pasta into the pot. Whereas, Kraft tells you to pour the dry cheese powder on top of the cooked pasta. As to the calories: ""Now hear this: Annie's has more and fat and calories than KRAFT."" This is not true, again, if prepared according to the instructions. Kraft is 380 calories 23% from fat whereas Annie's is only 290 calories 8% from fat. Note that Annie's obtains this by eliminating the need for butter. If someone were go and add the same amount of butter to the Annie's recommended preparation method, then the calories and fat count would be higher. But this would be silly, since the Annie's cheese mix is blended to replace the need for the butter. Side note: Annie's does list an alternative higher fat preparation method using ½ the amount of butter as Kraft. In this case the calories would be roughly 350 with 18% coming from fat, still a little less than found with Kraft. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
