 surprisingly good for a supermarket tea,5,"The conventional wisdom is that Lapsang Souchong is an acquired taste. It's probably more the case that you are going to either love or hate this tea after the first couple of cups (give yourself a couple of cups' worth before passing judgement, so that you don't confuse surprise with dislike). You have as much chance of liking or disliking this tea as you do any other. I personally think Earl Grey has a ""funkier"" smell and taste to it than Lapsang, though that doesn't stop me from drinking it. Do yourself a favor and start with fresh water in a clean kettle, and a fresh tea-bag in a cup or mug. Even with a mug, my experience has been that the brew time suggested is a little long. Go with 4 rather than 5, and that might help if you are nervous that the tea is going to be especially bitter. Really, this tea, if properly made, is not bitter at all. In fact, I never add sugar or sweeteners to any tea, and Lapsang tastes slightly sweet to me on its own. For a supermarket tea, this is a bargain. I got a 20-count in the grocery store on a 2 for 5-buck sale, and it's hard to beat roughly 12 cents for a pour, for this quality. To give you a comparison, I'm currently curing a Yixing teapot with a premium green tea that ran 40-some dollars for the quarter-pound. Consider that this Lapsang is costing you malt-liquor prices and you may be a bit more charitable with your expectations. And by the way, premium lapsang souchong is out there, but based on reviews I've read on other sites, many drinkers don't find that the taste is significantly enhanced, unlike other teas, which really do tend to get progressively better as the price increases. …",21 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 Great Bold Smooth Kup of Coffee,5,"This is Green Mountain's response to the Coffee People's Donut Shop coffee. Many people actually confuse the two which isn't difficult to do: donut house and donut shop -- both are extra bold in flavor, and both are excellent. Since Donut Shop is my favorite, I decided to conduct a taste test between these two rivals. Side to side they are very similar, very little acid taste, no bitterness which is what I look for in an extra bold roast. Head to head Donut Shop edged this coffee, Donut House, out by the slightest of margin. Donut Shop had slightly more body to it but frankly, it took me drinking a half cup of each before I could declare a winner. This is why I also think this is a 5 star coffee -- excellent choice if you want a simple, great tasting cup of coffee that you will not get sick of. …",42 out of 42 users found this review helpful

 Great Product,5,"I purchased after reading many reviews. Use on face, chest and hands. The first application was not dramatic as far as results go; but I use daily and the results are fantastic. It took me about a week to get the impressive results. I have very dry skin. My serums and creams were not penetrating into my skin to give me a hydrated look. Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating. My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking. I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes. Remove in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture. The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it. This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant! My hands were looking rough. My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help. I use this on my hands every night, remove with a microdermabrasion product then apply a thick lotion. Finally my hands look very nice. I have stocked up on this product, I never want to run out. I also use the eye treatment, spray toner (use throughout the day to freshen up makeup), body polish and body creams. Sometimes I can get lucky and find this product line in stores; but not very often. Finally a product line that works! …",20 out of 23 users found this review helpful

" too easy, even for ""not-so-smart"" dogs",2,"i called up Kyjen customer service for a recommendation on a puzzle toy, and *bonus* got a iive person on the phone (brownie points for great service). I have a mini dachshund, who, although adorable, is not so bright and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item, my dachshund figured it out within minutes---i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly! Unfortunately, I wanted this toy to last for a while but this one unfortunately is too easy. See, If you spin the star just 20 degrees, *all* the treat trays are exposed, and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dogs playtime and challenge them further. However, my dog does love other Kyjen Toys -- the Tail Teaser, Egg Babies platypus and Hide-A-Squirrel in the junior size. Based on the great customer service and other toys, i will try some different Kyjen puzzle games instead. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 Wonderfully addicting espresso,5,"This is a warning: A love for good espresso is an expensive habit!!! I've been making my own espresso at home for 20 years. Every morning I would grind the beans, measure and tamp them into the filter, add water, steam my milk, and then wash the entire machine and repeat. I have to wake up early because this is a time consuming process. I've tried other pod machines, and they just don't make a good cup of espresso. I recently began using the illy Francis Francis Y1 with iperEspresso capsules, and the result is better than my manual method, and takes a little over a minute a cup. Generally, I take my cappuccino cup and heat an ounce of milk in the microwave for 30 seconds, use a hand frother for just a few seconds, press the button on the Y1, and in about 20 seconds it brews a 1 or 2 ounce shot of perfect espresso (you have to depress the button when you think it is finished - there is no auto shutoff). Wham, bam, done! As far as I know, the iperEspresso system is the only ""pod"" that comes close to a real cup of espresso with crema. And this crema is really a thing of beauty. If you don't know what I'm talking about, try it once and you'll understand. As someone who likes strong coffee, the dark roast is almost not strong enough, but the flavor is so well balanced. It's the perfect blend of bitter and sweet with a body worth savoring. This isn't cheap, and it's more wasteful than grinding your own beans. So take that into consideration. But, I've only had espresso this good in Italy. Constant trips to Italy would be very wasteful and expensive, so that's my barely rational justification. I'd also like to share that the Y1 seems to be the most affordable offering in illy's line of iperEspresso systems. It retails for $295, but illy offers a promotion where you can buy the Y1 for $125 when you order a minimum of 2 canisters (21 count) through illy's website (illyusa ). There are no other requirements to fulfill. So the machine and the coffee adds up to less than the cost of the machine itself. I took advantage of this deal and I couldn't be happier. This coffee will put a new spin on your day. Not to sound too cheesy, but I can't wait to wake up each morning and enjoy my first cup. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Affordable Fun for your Dog!,4,"I have a golden retriever as well as a pembroke welsh corgi. They love their food and tend to inhale it. But they are also very smart and tend to get board. I bought the Star Spinner as well as the paw print shaped toy by this same company and they had a blast from the moment I filled it and set it on the floor! I love that the toys are plastic. So they are much easier to clean (just spray and rinse in the sink, or wipe out with a clorox wipe). Particularly since my corgi prefers soft/moist treats as compared to my dry kibble loving golden. I bought this for roughly $20 at my local canine specialty store, which is far more affordable than the ""name brand"" products. And since I worry about the bacterial growth on the far more expensive wooden models, the easy to clean and disinfect plastic one has been perfect for us. Safety Note: as with ANY dog toy, please supervise your dog while using. Their ""drive"" will be increased while playing with the toy, and with the paw print model with the removable cups, don't let your dog chew on the cups, but redirect him to the treat inside the dish after he pulls out the cup. My golden retriever loves it so much that I now use it to give him his kibble every day! Which is much safer as the bigger dogs tend towards bloat, which can kill your dog. This allows him to have fun while eating tiny amounts of kibble at a time. Win,Win! …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Delicious Sweetener for Tea and Baking,5,"Organic Sucanat is many levels above regular white granulated sugar. This sugar takes baking and tea drinking to new levels of pleasure. When holding this sugar in the palm of your hand, you will notice the irregularity of the crystals and the ""dark brown sugar"" color. This does have a flavor that is reminiscent of brown sugar and yet the texture is much more natural and the crystals take longer to melt on your tongue. Recently I've been discovering a variety of more natural sweeteners. This on is perfect for tea because it not only adds sweetness; it adds a caramel flavor to teas in which you use milk. There is a purity in the flavor and you feel better because you are supporting organic farms and keeping your body healthy. This is a one-for-one replacement for refined white or brown sugar. Sucanat is made from 100% certified organic sugar cane. The sugar cane is ""green cut."" This means the fields are not burned and the leaves and tops of the cane plant are left in the field. The sugar is minimally processed and once the sugar cane is harvested it is pressed to squeeze out all the cane juice. This juice is then clarified, filtered and evaporated. This helps to remove excess water. The syrup is then crystallized and a sugar with a molasses flavor is produced. There are also vitamins, minerals and trace elements from the sugar cane plant. One teaspoon of Sucanat contains 10mg of Potassium and 6mg of Calcium. If you are still using white sugar, try Sucanat. It might surprise you with added flavor, goodness and purity. I find the flavor to be superior to refined white sugar. This sugar will add a touch of caramel flavor to all your baking. If you are looking for an even deeper flavor for chocolate recipes, try Muscovado sugar. It has a rich flavor that can't be matched by any regular brown sugar you would find in your grocery store. With Muscovado and Sucanat, you can take your baking to the next level. ~The Rebecca Review …",63 out of 65 users found this review helpful
 tasty snack!,5,"Korean seaweed snacks are very tasty. My local Chinese supermarket sells this brand, in addition to another favorite Korean Seaweed Snack (Kim Nori), Roasted w/Olive oil & Sea Salted, 0.17-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12) . If you've tried Japanese seaweed snacks and didn't like them, you may like Korean ones. Korean seaweed snacks are typically roasted and flavored with salt and oil while Japanese ones are oil-less. This makes Korean seaweed sheets very light, flaky, and crispy. They just crumble in your mouth. Both are very nutritious and healthy, but Japanese seaweed strips are thicker and more chewy. The downside to the yumminess is that Korean seaweed snacks typically taste saltier, so it's best to eat them with a bowl of rice, though I've gone through several packs of them on their own. You also have to wipe your fingers afterward because of the oil. Inside each pouch is a plastic tray that holds 6 or 8 sheets of pre-cut seaweed to prevent crush damage. If you don't like seaweed at all, you might not like this. Seaweed snacks are not for everyone. But if you do, definitely give this a try. …",20 out of 21 users found this review helpful

" Agave ""nectar"" is a scam",1,"from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.: Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food. Sorry. Don't kill the messenger. It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word ""Agave"" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup. Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as ""diabetic friendly"". What's not to like? As it turns out, quite a lot. Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener. All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS. Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price. Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) . And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat. In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. Inulin is a fructose polymer and is not digestible. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to separate the inulin into fructose molecules, resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent. ""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"". Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you. …",13 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee,5,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday. I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now). However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee. I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"". Enter Donut Blend. I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family. When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it. Here is my take on it: It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity. Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii. It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee. If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup. Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one. Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.

 This one supplement has changed my life!!!!!,5,"I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.) None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life. That is, until Natural Calm. This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically! Here are the things this supplement has helped with: Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night. Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations. Mood--- Made me generally happier. Decreased muscle cramping and soreness. Improved gums and teeth. Improved hair loss. Improved digestion and transit time. Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too! But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really. There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Superstore if you want more science of magnesium.) I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement. If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want. Here's wishing you great health! …",37 out of 46 users found this review helpful
 Average,3,"Is this hot chocolate....yes Is this good hot chocolate....um, sorta Is this gourmet hot chocolate....not a chance. In my opinion, the only advantage you get but using the Green Mountain K-cups of hot chocolate is the simplicity of using your Keurig machine to heat the water instead of using the microwave or stove-top. Other than that the finished product is comparable to any Swiss Miss or other brand of powdered instant cocoa. It actually may be worse if you use the largest setting on your machine. The largest setting makes it much too watery. Green Mountain needs to go back to the drawing board on this. 3 stars because it does make hot chocolate in your Keurig without having to dirty dishes and tear open pouches, but if you're looking for good hot chocolate, keep shopping. …",40 out of 41 users found this review helpful

 TRIVEDI WATER IS GREAT!!  GREAT RESULTS!,5,"Transformed Favorite Tree with the Trivedi Blessed Water - After the San Diego Retreat - My story: I came home from the San Diego Trivedi Retreat and I remembered what Guruji said about wanting us to be ""the happiest we could be."" I had this thought in my head as I was coming out of my car and when I saw ""my favorite"" tree in the front lawn. I decided to convey this same message to the Japanese Red Maple tree and to the grass I walked on going to the front door as I poured the last of my Trivedi Blessed water around the base of the Japanese Red Maple and on the grass leading to the front door. Well, this year just 1 month later, the Japanese Red Maple tree has the most beautiful colored and healthy looking leaves and the most unusual beautiful arrangement of pink flowers I had not seen before. I asked my friends and family members if they ever remembered the tree producing so many pink flowers in this circle pattern ever and they all said they do not remember the tree having so many of these kind of pink flowers in this full circular pattern and so many all over the tree. Some remembered it had pink flowers here and there always, but this year they are all over the tree abundantly and each outcropping is in a beautiful and full circle pattern. The flowers are EVERYWHERE this year. ALL OVER the whole tree! Usually the flower bunches are just a few places on the tree, but after the Trivedi Blessed water; the flower bunches were so full and everywhere on the tree!! Also, there is a new Circle Pattern of Flowers on ONE Stem!! No one (friends, family) ever remembers seeing this beautiful circle pattern of a lot of flowers on ONE stem. Usually there are 2 to 5 flowers on a stem but here and everywhere on the tree EACH STEM had at least 500% more flowers per stem after the Trivedi Blessed water. In the past the tree never made this beautiful circle pattern of flowers per stem. Before usually there were just 2-5 flowers on a stem in a random pattern! Now there is this beautiful circle pattern of flowers we have never seen before. Aside from the plants, when I drink one bottle of Trivedi Blessed water daily I feel so energized and healthy. Since I have run out I see that my energy level has gone down some and I'm a little ""squeaky"" in my joints. I can't wait till it is in stock so I can stock up. In my opinion it is the best present you can buy yourself and any of your friends and family. I know what's going under our tree this Christmas! Maybe not the most conventional gift but my family and friends will thank me later once they start drinking it and pouring it on their plants. PS A neighbor asked us to watch her 2 house plants while they were gone and I used a little Trivedi blessed water that I had from my last retreat and before they could come back 3 weeks later BOTH plants are blooming!! When I asked her if she had ever seen them bloom before, she said she's had them around 5 years and had seen them bloom maybe once. Coincidence? Maybe, but I doubt it. I only used regular water and Trivedi Blessed water on her plants while they were gone. I've seen it too many times when I've poured Trivedi Blessed water on my own plants and bushes. They bloom and flower like never before. This year I used it in our flower pots on the porch and it was the first year in over 20 years that the deer actually came up on our porch (up 2 steps to a concrete porch) to eat the flowers we had planted in the flower pot. The same type of flowers we always plant only this year I used the Trivedi Blessed water in the pots. I don't eat the flowers so I don't know but there must have been something good in those flowers this year for the deer to make their way on our porch to eat them. They never did that before and it's not like the deer around here are hungry, they are all big and fat this year so in my opinion only they were going for their dessert! LOL! PS For more of my results with the Trivedi Blessings and water and to see the actual photos of the Red Maple tree go to thebestoftrivediblessings The tree story is no. 10.

 price is highway robbery,1,"These pellets are the EXACT same as ""equine (horse) bedding"", and similar to wood pellets for pellet stoves. You can buy a 40 (yes, forty!) pound bag of equine pellet bedding for only $6!!! (vs $10 for 20 pounds of Feline Pine!) I purchase at my local farm/tractor store. Wood stove pellets are even less - can get 40 pounds as cheap as $4. I called the manufacture of one wood pellet stove product and they told me it is totally safe for pets...no chemicals used in production, and made from PINE, etc. However, some wood pellet stove are made from hardwoods (not pine) and this would not be as absorbent so you need to double check on the type of wood stove pellets. I'd stick with equine bedding...it is pine and made for animals. I do love this type of litter! No dust. Absorbs and masks odor better than any other litter. After using this type of litter for a couple years, I am pretty ""skilled"" at being able to scoop out mostly only the sawdust, and leave the intact pellets behind. My cats usually pee in the corners so that is where most of the sawdust is. Also, if you shake the box, sawdust drops to bottom and you can scrape intact pellets to the side and scoop the sawdust underneath out. If you don't pay attention when you scoop and are not tedious with a ""method"" like me, you will likely also scoop out a lot of the intact pellets too and thus waste a lot of it. We went out of town for 2 weeks, and our cat sitter used DOUBLE the amount of litter we use! For the star rating - I'd actually give 5 stars for this pine pellet type of litter. But I am giving one star because of the ridiculous price charged by Feline Pine!! …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 TRICLOPYR is what you need for POISON IVY...,5,"This contains Triclopyr, which is more aggressive than Glyphosate. It is also more persistent which means that you don't want to spray it close to plants you value. Triclopyr is what you need to knock out Poison Ivy. Poison Ivy and a lot of other shrubs or trees can take a swig of Glyphosate (Round Up), gargle twice with it and spit it back into your face just for giggles. I've used this and the Ortho Brush-B-Gon. They contain the same active ingredient and I haven't observed any significant difference. This stuff is the real deal - I found it when I was trying to locate a product called Vine-X (discontinued?) and found out that it was 13.6% Triclopyr in a penetrating oil. You simply brush it onto cuts or active vines and it would kill the entire plant. This is where it is really nice to buy the concentrate instead of the pre-mix. I spray the diluted version but also use the concentrate in a small bottle. If I cut a thicker vine or trunk, I simply drip the concentrate on it and it will kill the roots and vine. Besides PI we also have wild grapevine, Buckthorn, Box Elder, and many other invasive and nuisance plans in the woods. Because Poison Ivy is a creeping vine with multiple roots along it's length, eradication is helped with a higher concentration than the label instructs. (My observation) I use it between 50% to 100% (double) strength. It appears that if you spray it in one spot you will kill that part of the vine, but if you hit it (in enough places) with something strong enough you can kill the whole plant down to the roots. Make sure you spray it when you think it won't rain for at least a couple of days or else you will probably need to spray it again. Make sure you get all ""sprouts."" From extensive hand pulling, My observation is that for every ""sprout"" there is another ~3 feet of vine lurking around and another sprout hiding somewhere nearby.

Reishi mushroom is not an easy ingredient to find and has been touted as a wonderdrug for hundreds of ailments and preventative for even more, including many forms of cancer. I'm unable to consume caffeine, so I had to find alternatives. Many coffee alternatives taste too ""earthy"" or ""forest-y"" and not much like coffee at all. This is the best that I've found.

 This is the new Ketchup,5,"I was going to High School in California about 15 years ago when a Vietnamese friend of mine INSIST that I try this. I'm pretty open minded to new kinds of foods so I gave it a try. ""Tongue Ought Shurocka?"" I said. ""DUDE!"" ""Not even close!"" he said as he laughed like hell. I still have no idea how to pronounce the name but it has been my favorite Hot Sauce ever since. Over the years, I have been seeing it pop up everywhere from PF Chang's & Applebee's to Firehouse Subs. If you like hot sauce or any kind of spicy foods at all, then you MUST try this. I INSIST. Imagine going through your entire life without Ketchup or BBQ sauce? Just take a second and actually think about how plain so many foods would taste like without them. ""The Rooster Sauce"" is like that. As you can see from the other reviews, it has about the same applications as BBQ sauce or Ketchup would have for a person who likes it hot. No other hot sauce that I have ever tried has the same texture, heat and most importantly FLAVOR as this one does. It brings out the flavor in nearly anything that you put it on, from the obvious Tacos, burritos, Chow Mein, Chili, Meat & Poultry, to Clam Chowder, fish sticks or even.. OMG Peanut Butter Sandwiches? (haven't done that one yet but it's probably ... interesting). Let me try to describe this to somebody who hasen't tried ""The Rooster Sauce"" before. First of all, unlike standard hot sauce, it has the texture of Ketchup or BBQ sauce which makes it cling to any kind of finger foods, chips, etc. perfectly. The taste is what is the kicker though. A garlicky, sweet, HOT flavor that is vastly different from anything else. Since it comes in a convenient squeeze bottle, it can be applied to anything, anywhere. This stuff is a god send when living in a world of quick, frozen, packaged, fast food which is dull, bland and virtually tasteless. This is also great for anybody on a special diet who wants to add some flavor to a very limited menu. As far as the Heat is concerned, let me warn you that this stuff is pretty darn HOT. It's made from Red Jalapeno paste so it's not ridiculously hot but it definitely has some serious heat. If you don't like hot, spicy food then this stuff probably isn't for you. On the other hand, a little goes a long way. Just a few drops add good spice and flavor. A WHOLE BUNCH ... may take a little getting used to. I've gotten to the point where I literally submerge things like chicken wings into this stuff. It will really make you sweat out those toxins. ""The Rooster Sauce"" would also make a good gift for the person who has it all. A few years ago, I was living all the way across the U.S. and my Mom sent me a bottle. It sounds silly but it was one of the most cherished items in my house. If giving it to somebody who has never tried it before, it may very well be like introducing someone to BBQ or Ketchup for the first time. In other words it's a thing that they will always remember. Now as far as complaints? Well as stated in another review, the cap can get a little bit gunky, so you may have to run it under the sink a few times to get it nice and clean again. Not a real big deal. The other isn't a complaint at all but because they don't use any artificial colors, the sauce can darken after a few months. It will go from the original bright red to a deep red color. I haven't really noticed a difference in taste though. Since this is hot sauce, you can store it unrefrigerated without worrying about it getting spoiled. I actually prefer to have the color change slightly then to have it filled with artificial junk to keep it looking nice. If you really have to keep the nice bright red color, then I suggest keeping it refrigerated. One last thing to keep in mind. This product is MADE IN THE U.S.A. In an economy as bad as this one, we need all of the help we can get. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Warning: Make sure you're buying the right flavor.,1,"I bought some of this chocolate for my mother who can't have much caffeine. She used to drink Nestle hot cocolate, fat free-caffeine free, but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches. Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephen's on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Superstore are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Superstore would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its ""food"". and the company who makes it basically said ""Sorry, but it sucks to be you"".

The pieces were easy to assemble and the tray that comes with the kit is handy (beats having to find some cardboard to cover with tin foil. My only complaint is the frosting because it got overly gooey before we could finish our assembly and it wasn't tough enough to hold some of the heavier candy. I kept putting it in the fridge to firm it up a little. I'd also recommend cutting the tip of the frosting at less than the 1/4"" that the instructions recommend.

 Excellent Source of Magnesium,5,"If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too. I've also tried a flavored version of this product (Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder). Unlike that version, this stuff is entirely odorless, and the only taste is a sense of tartness. I much prefer this non-flavored version over the flavored version. The only problem I have with this product is that it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage. That's pretty insignificant. So, I still rate it at an Excellent five stars out of five. Highly recommended. Especially if you're taking calcium. …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful

" Pretty healthy, but not a low sugar product",4,"Now, one of the reviewers of this product complained about the sugar content of this cereal by only looking at the ingredients list, which is not how to determine the nutritional value of any product (especially when the reviewer cannot distinguish between nutritive and non-nutritive ingredients). This cereal has just as many simple sugars as Frosted Flakes, but the cereal does not claim to be low in sugar. What's important about this cereal is that it offers quite a bit of fiber and vitamins/minerals (not as much as some cereals, but since I have no deficiencies in this area, I didn't mind). Also, it only has 3 times the salt of a half cup of milk which is not LOADED. A can of healthy choice soup, now that is loaded with salt. Now, I chose this cereal as a replacement for Frosted Flakes/Honey Nut Cheerios, which against my better judgment I continued to have every morning. I should point out that I don't drink coffee in the mornings and I don't drink soda (less than 1 a week on average). I also eat no sweets. Simple sugars (listed as just ""Sugars"" on the nutrition label) seem to be treated like carcinogens, while most people don't realize that aspartame (artificial sweetener in most diet sodas) really is one. If your diet is already low in sugar and you feel confident you can burn through those sugars pretty quick (since I don't drink caffeinated drinks, I need that jolt in the morning), then this is a good choice. If your diet already has quite a bit of sugar or your doctor tells you to cut down on simple sugars (or you also have a couple of cups of caffeinated coffee with sugar every morning), then go with another bran cereal without the oat clusters and syrups (which I really do not like that much). Also, if you are concerned about the total carbs, please note that a normal 2000 calories diet would include about 300g of carbohydrates (so yes, high protein diets contradict this). Since taste is completely subjective, I won't put much emphasis on it. In my opinion, it tastes pretty good (but I don't consume many sweets during the day). …",14 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 No real cinnamon in these chips,3,"I wish I'd known the ingredient list for Hershey's Cinnamon Chips when I bought these (the ingredient list was not part of the product description as the time of this review). There's no real cinnamon in them. I had been using King Arthur's mini cinnamon chips previously (ingredients: sugar, palm oil, cinnamon, nonfat dry milk, soy lecithin) and was happy with them, but I was curious about Hershey's chips. They were cheaper than King Arthur's, and I'd heard people rave about the Hershey's cinnamon chips. Well, curiosity killed the cat. Now I have a lot of bags of Hershey's cinnamon chips that I don't want to use in my baked goods..... I might end up using them if I'm baking something to give away where the person eating it won't know I made it. I used my King Arthur chips in Cinnamon Chip Bread, great results, but when I switched to Hershey's, the chips kinda melt and get mixed a little with the bread dough, and that turned my bread YELLOW. Artificial colors are on the ingredient list before the natural & artificial flavor.... that's a lot of artificial color! I usually don't care about artificial ingredients, I'm a junk food addict who drools at the sight of bright orange Doritos, but the yellow bread the Hershey's cinnamon chips made was displeasing. Not to mention the flavor of the bread, which was negatively affected by the Hershey's chips. Didn't have that same sweet cinnamon flavor that the King Arthur chips give. Why'd I give this product 3 stars instead of 1 star? My husband didn't care about the changes in the bread, he'll eat anything I turn my nose up at, so he'll probably end up eating stuff I make for him with the Hershey's cinnamon chips. Hopefully my bags of chips won't go to waste, but I won't buy Hershey's cinnamon chips again.

 Greenies can pose a risk of intestinal blockage and death!!,1,"PLEASE, please do not feed these treats to your dogs/cats. The company has not publicized the risk of blockage and choking, and 13 dogs have died as a result of ingesting Greenies. Try googling ""Greenies"" and ""blockage"" or ""death."" This product is not safe for dogs. I was sent a free sample of the ""reformulated"" Greenie in the mail. The package claims the treat is ""easier to digest"", so I gave the treat to my dog, a 100 pound weimaraner. I watched my dog chew the treat, and he chewed it appropriately, taking his time to chew the pieces into small, digestible chunks. The next day, my dog refused to eat or drink anything and vomited at least three times. He acted listless and lethargic all day, so that evening we called our vet. We told the vet that the last thing our dog ate was a Greenie. The vet informed us that Greenies are known to cause intestinal blockage in some cases. He suggested that we take him to the emergency vet clinic for advanced treatment. We took him to the emergency clinic for x-rays and diagnosis. The vet treated him with an anti-vomiting medication and told us to return if he continued to vomit. The cost of this visit was approximately $400. The next day, we woke up to find our dog covered in **** soft stool. He has had three bouts of diarreha in two hours, all of it soft and ****. We called our vet and he told us that the dog was experiencing severe intestinal distress, which was causing the **** stool. He suggested we give him water and return to the clinic in the early a.m. Thankfully, our dog passed the Greenie through his body. Had he not passed the Greenie, he would have required exploratory surgery, which my vet estimates will cost approximately $3,000, depending on the nature of the blockage. The representation that the new, reformulated Greenie is ""easier to digest"" is patently false. Our dog properly chewed the Greenie, but yet the treat was still insoluble and indigestible.

 Delicious topping with Japanese flair!,5,"I know, some of you may be thinking, GROSS! Fish shavings?? But if you like fish, and the flavors of Japanese food, then you'll love these Bonito Flakes. This brand's individual packages is very convenient and ensures that you always have the freshest serving. Bonito flakes are part of the base soup stock in miso soup, so you've probably had a taste of it without even knowing it. Don't think they are only good for stocks, however. The flakes themselves are a delicious addition to a block of cold tofu with some soy sauce, and also on a bowl of steamed rice, again with a little soy sauce. They are also great when mixed with fresh cucumber slices and soy sauce. If you're getting the drift, they are much more flavorful when a drizzle of soy sauce is added too. Bonito flakes, called ""hanakatsuo"" in Japanese, are a fabulous source of protein and are a quick and easy way to add a lot of taste to even a plain bowl of rice. I guess if you purchase some and don't agree with my review, you can follow the lead of one of the other reviewers and feed it to your cats... …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Exploding K-Cup,2,"First off - disappointed with the false ""Prime Shipping"". I ordered this on 8/9 thinking I would get it before my vacation on 8/12. It came on 8/13 after I was already gone - if that was the case I would have ordered it when I returned. So I tried this product, despite the reviews and it exploded for me also. I used Cyclone first - it started coming out fine then began to squirt all over. When the K-Cup exploded, the foil opened on the side of the cup. What I noticed when I opened the box was that the foil that seals the K-Cups were not properly attached to them. They did not go all the way to the ends of the cups (like all the other brands I compared them too). Also, they were not sealed tight with the bubble on the top (like the other brands I have) which tells me they are not sealed properly. I am disappointed. The taste is OK (that's the 2 stars) but the poor design is frustrating and messy. POOR DESIGN! I will not order these again. I am not even sure I will use what I have or if I will attempt to return them. …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" Best instant coffee I have tasted, including the Starbucks VIA",5,"You will not disappointed with the quality of this coffee. In the instant coffee scale, this coffee deserves a 9.5 out of 10. Not only does this coffee tastes great with potent caffeine rush similar to a Starbucks brewed coffeee, but it also is also reasonably priced. Its only downside in taste is a very slight acidic aftertaste. I use this coffee at work and at home. Instead of going to Starbucks everyday, I now spend approximately 25-50 cents (depending on how much coffee I drink) a day on a similar caliber instant coffee. I think Bustelo should introduce a smaller packet size so the coffee will be more portable for travels. I have also tried Starbucks VIA. Although VIA is also a nice instant coffee, it costs almost $2 (2 packets) per a large cup. At that price, it is actually cheaper to go to Starbucks and buy its fresh brew. If you are looking for the best instant coffee that comes close to a quality of a high quality brewed coffee at an affordable price, then look no further. This coffee will fit your needs very nicely. …",22 out of 23 users found this review helpful

I can no longer get it at local health food stores, so I order it from Superstore. I eat it as a snack (with a tall glass of water to drink) and I have put it in hot frying pan to make it crispy (changes color a bit) great for tossing into popcorn or in salads. I get the seaweed in pieces, it comes also in flakes which you can use to spread (pieces to large to use in salt shaker) but you can get a shaker with larger holes. Then, you use as if it were salt on foods. The taste is aquired, and different than sushi type Nori or green kelp seaweed, but if it is for you, you have an electrolyte packed source for life! Affects thyroid (iodine) so check with your doctor if you have an issue, but, if not, is a great weight loss healthy aide. Take apple cider vinegar (can be taken in pill form, it is only food, not medication) can be taken with the seaweed as an old-time diet aide. I guess you can figure out that I LOVE this stuff!

 Chemical supplements should be taken based on the advice of a qualified health care provider,2,"As I have problems with sleep at night and tried all sorts of things which are most commonly recommended to improve it, I tought I try this well rated product. I tried it in all the various recommended dosages. But it didn't make the slightest difference for me. Thus I guess that it probably only works if the cause of the unrest is a magnesium deficiency. Reportedly: ""With supplements, overdose is possible, however, particularly in people with poor renal function; occasionally, with use of high cathartic doses of magnesium salts, severe hypermagnesemia has been reported to occur even without renal dysfunction"". ""Safety Issues The US government has set the following upper limits for use of magnesium supplements: Children 1-3 years: 65 mg 4-8 years: 110 mg Adults: 350 mg Pregnant or Nursing Women: 350 mg"" ""It has been called nature's calcium channel blocker."" ""Magnesium assists in calcium uptake, but it also competes with dietary calcium for the same absorption site in the intestine. Excessive dietary calcium (or phosphorus) is much more likely to block magnesium absorption than vice- versa in the typical American diet. Magnesium absorption is also inhibited by excessive dietary fat, phosphate, lactose, phytates and oxalates which form insoluble compounds with magnesium. Magnesium is also lost in diarrhea, long term use of diuretics, excessive sugar intake and protein malnutrition... ... there are lower levels of minerals in food today due to depletion of the soil in modern farming methods. (23) Modern methods of milling, processing and the preservation of food cause nutrient losses, eg 85% of magnesium is removed from whole wheat in the milling.""

 WARNING -- read reviews--Canidae has changed their formula.,1,"My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet. Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea. My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks. After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet! Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill. My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula. Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae. …",20 out of 23 users found this review helpful

The sardines were acceptable quality, certainly not on par with their premium line, but certainly not bad. The tasteless oil didnt help. Sardines were packed in tight. I would give the Sardines 3 Stars, if not for the fact that you get a great deal: 24 cans! So 4 stars..barely.

 Good stuff,4,"Pretty close to what I used to have back in Japan. Anyone new to shirataki, be prepared for an awful fishy smell when you open the bag. The fluid they come in is the source of the smell, so if you rinse them off you'll be rid of it. I recommend rinsing out the bag they came in as well before you put it in the trash. These don't have much flavor of their own, and they're not supposed to, so don't judge them by tasting straight out of the package. The texture won't be what you're expecting either if someone told you these could substitute for spaghetti. They're very rubbery. Cook them in something, preferably a soup stock if you want to enjoy them they way they were meant to be eaten. If you intend to use them with a pasta sauce, put them in the sauce while you're warming it up. If you just pour the sauce on them after the fact, they won't have much chance to absorb the flavor. For best results, before using in any sauce or liquid of your own, throw them in a very hot non-stick skillet on high and swish them around for 1 min until they start making a squeaking sound. This will get rid of some of the liquid they've already absorbed so that they can absorb more flavor from what you cook them in. Cooked properly, these can become a delicious and filling part of a meal. …",38 out of 39 users found this review helpful

 Tapioca?  In *my* tea?  It's more common than you think.,4,"Admittedly, I'm not the greatest chef, so take my review with a grain of salt. I recently became addicted to bubble tea. So rather than blowing 15+ bucks a week on it, I decided to start treating myself at home. The tapioca itself is high quality, with texture and flavor much like you find in stores, and it seems to keep fairly well. The problem I found is that the instructions for cooking the pearls on the package are fairly... incorrect. Tapioca requires a much longer cooking time than advertised, and also, despite them having a fairly high sugar content naturally, in order to give them that sweet, syrupy taste you get from the stores, you'll have to coat and/or cook them in a boat load of sugar (a mixture of brown/white sugar will do, I prefer to use agave nectar personally).

" Review of Roastaroma, Cafix, Pero, and Postum",4,"I recently gave up coffee and decided to try three different coffee substitutes: Roastaroma, Cafix, and Pero. Although Cafix tasted the most like real coffee (and it tastes *a lot* like real coffee), and all three products are pretty good, Roastaroma was my favorite. It is very similar to coffee, but it doesn't quite have the bitter bite of coffee. Those of you who are looking for that slight bitterness might prefer Cafix. Roastaroma actually reminds me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate--the cinnamon and carob flavors come through pretty strongly in the drink, giving it a cinnamon-chocolatey flavor. I used to drink coffee to satisfy my sweet tooth on low calories. This drink totally fits the bill for this purpose. The Pero is pretty good, too. Like Roastaroma, it doesn't have the bitter coffee taste, but it still makes for a decent imitation of decaf. I like to drink it with cinnamon-flavored powdered creamer. Pero's a good value, too: it's strong enough that you don't need to use very much to flavor your whole drink. I drink the Pero when I'm trying to ration the Roastaroma out to myself so as not to run out. So Roastaroma has the best flavor, Cafix tastes the most like coffee, and Pero is a good back-up. A quick note on Postum: I do not care for it. I find that people who like Postum tend to be people who were never coffee drinkers. It tastes nothing like coffee. If you try Postum as a coffee substitute, you will be disappointed. …",48 out of 49 users found this review helpful

 Lovely oil--will definitely continue to use.,5,"I first read about this oil in Cooks Illustrated magazine. Here's what I love: 1) highest smoke point--I see cooking shows all the time heating up olive oil in a saute pan--DON""T! 2) VERY neutral flavor--whether baking, pan frying, marinating, etc. the oil flavor is in the background 3) doesn't solidify in the fridge (in salad dressings, marinades, etc.) like olive oil 4) best oil out there for good fat composition Everyone touts olive oil as so good for you, and it does have its place, as does grapeseed oil. But if you only want to buy ONE healthy oil for many cooking uses, buy this--you won't be sorry. *Note: when my bottles arrives they each had a little bit of oil leakage around the top. Even though the bottles are sealed on top in plastic wrapper they are NOT sealed underneath the cap. I contact the manufacturer and alerted them to this--maybe they'll make a change.

 An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee,5,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday. I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now). However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee. I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"". Enter Donut Blend. I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family. When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it. Here is my take on it: It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity. Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii. It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee. If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup. Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one. Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.

 Boxed Evolution,5,"Long live Camper Van Beethoven!! This is a blessing for long time CVB fans who didn't have a chance to upgrade their collection to CD before most of this went out of print. Wow, where to begin? CVB was a band that matured on record, so to speak, so this is really a fascinating and entertaining listen from beginning to end. Of course you get the endearing and humorous debut album with goofy anthems ala ""Take the Skinheads Bowling"" and various folk/ska instrumentals; the increasingly warped and psychedelic ""II & III""; and this collections' centerpiece: the self titled 3rd album!! Forget the editorial remark above about them ""scratching their heads out loud"" on this because there's nothing confused, unfocused, or tentative about this album. I'd say it's a characteristically irreverent and eclectic psych-rock masterpiece. The song writing has fully matured with the sarcastic humor still intact, and it seems to be intentionally conceived as an album that gets stranger and stranger as it goes on, with the group mastering every diverse style they apply themselves to. I could go on and on about this album, but suffice it to say it's a classic. ""Camper Vantiquities"", the 4th CD is a top notch odds and ends collection containing perhaps the best Camper song ever: ""Seven Languages"" and the Harrison/Starkey composition ""Photograph."" Finally, the live CD is a competent but not revelatory live set from 1990 with 2 songs from 1988. I would've prefered to hear an earlier and more chaotic live recording, but I'm sure the quality wouldn't have been as good. All in all, you can't go wrong with this. The packaging is quality: a thick , bright orange box with the 5 Cds in simple glossy slip cases, (well, the box is relatively thin but it's made of nice thick cardboard) and a full color booklet with 2 essays.

Most recipes I've seen for Israeli couscous have you adding things like tomatoes or olives, but I bought this pearl couscous from Superstore (Barry Farms) and just cooked it up using some plain chicken broth...amazing!!! There were no cooking instructions on the back of the bag so be sure to cook it 10-12 minutes using a 1-cup couscous to 2-cup liquid ratio until all the liquid is absorbed. Or I guess you could try one of the numerous recipes you can find online at various websites ([...], etc.) Oh, I almost forgot to mention that my husband was so pleased with the pearl couscous, he asked me to buy a lot more of it off Superstore! It makes a terrific side dish and it's a nice change from plain veggies or seasoned rice. Enjoy! …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Ciao To Unsatisfying Pasta,1,"I tried this pasta because it was on sale at my local store, I usually buy the discount-priced store brands. And I was willing to excuse the slightly higher price (even with a coupon) on the premise I was eating 'heathy'. Well, I found out that after eating a dish of this stuff, I felt hungry again by dinner. I have fairly good diet control, so I assumed it was the low-carb construction. Having not eaten a low-carb pasta before, I was theorizing on it's effects. I then did some independent web research on this suspicion. And other people also had the same experience after having eaten this product. It does not leave you full. This defeats the purpose of eating. Buying this product at any price was a waste if I was not nourished. I might as well only had been imagining about eating. And considering that I buy pasta to be economically frugal in today's oh-so trying times, this is one brand which won't be cooked up again. …",4 out of 24 users found this review helpful

" lovely, beautiful tea",5,"Lapsang Souchong is what some might consider an acquired taste, because the smokiness and aroma of it are quite strong. Its aromatic reminiscence of woodsy smoke does not take away from the taste of the tea itself, which is rich, flavorful, and not at all bitter as one might suspect from the first overwhelming sniff. The taste is actually mellow and yet refreshing, the color a golden amber, and, as the reviewer below mentions, it is best when not steeped for too long. It's also best served without milk, as this takes away from the taste...but personal taste is personal taste. I must admit, I am not what you'd call a lapsang souchong snob, but I have tasted several brands, and Taylors of Harrogate offer the best I've ever tried.

 Better than Alton Brown's,5,"As another reviewer pointed out, this is NOT the same salt cellar as AB uses. I have both, and this one is better. Unlike AB's this one has a silicone gasket on the inside of the lid, which effectively seals out moisture, and more importantly, smells in. I purchased this one to use as a sugar bowl, hoping the seal would keep the ants out. My previous sugar bowls did not have air-tight lids and had to be retired during the summer, lest we find black six-legged critters happily munching on the contents. For the past two summer ""ant seasons"" this bowl has kept the critters at bay. While AB's is fine for salt, this would be better than his for that, too. Choosing between AB's and this one?

The Chinese Elm can be kept inside during the winter. but ALL bonsai's will do much better if you let them enjoy the summer weather outside.

 Thankfully this formula is also for infants,5,"I exclusively breastfed my first child for 2.5 years. When I had twins 8 months ago, I found it impossible to exclusively breastfeed them. Thankfully, I found this wonderful organic formula which they were supplemented on from day 1 (and they were a month early). If you go to the website (www.natureone ) you will see that the ingredients are identical to infant formulas - they simply call it a toddler formula for political reasons. See below. My twins are thriving and healthy. More pediatricians should read up about this and recommend it to those moms unable or unwilling to breastfeed. At least your babies won't be getting all the pesticides and growth hormones etc in commercial formula. It's really a sad state of affairs when there is only one organic formula available. Mothers need to demand better products, healthier products for their infants. Kim, Mother of three. extract from website: ""...Infant Formula Act (IFA), passed in 1980.

 OMG It WORKS!,5,"I have been using this product for almost a week now and my only complaint is that I didn't find pit about it sooner! First, a bit about myself. I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess! I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM. Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep! Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too. Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day! I feel so much lighter, my friends and family always said I was full of **** and I guess they were right! I guess after reading my review you are thinking either she is being paid for this or it really works, well it is definitely the latter! It is working for me and I believe it will work for you too, try it what have you got to lose besides a crappy mood, sleepless night, a lot of **** and cramps? Jeez, I think $23.00 is a pretty fair trade off don't you. One more thing the dosage that I am using is two teaspoons at night and one teaspoon in the morning, both with 3 teaspoons of benefiber mixed in girl still needs her fiber! and BTW it's a store brand).

I should have stuck with the cheaper meat. The meat came with extremely large amounts of fat all around. We had cut off a significant amount of fat prior to cooking,and the steak was still fatty once it was cooked. I was very dissapointed and so was he. We were going to call Omaha Steaks to complain, will never buy this brand again. Very unhappy with it. The taste wasn't even something that was worth raving about either.

" It has 202 cals and 53 carbs per cup. Great sweetener, but their marketing is misleading!",3,"I like this sweetener a lot. But it is not a NO sweetener like the label claims, it is a LOW calorie sweetener when you do the math. The company says on their website that are 202 calories and 53 grams of carbs for a cup of Ideal. So it is 12.5 cals/3.3 carbs a tablespoon, and 4 cals/1.1 carbs a teaspoon. So not an actual NO calorie sweetener like the bag says. They list 0 calories because they can since it is under 5 calories for the serving size they have listed, but on a large pouch meant for baking you would use way more than a teaspoon -- especially if you wanted to make any of the sweet items they have pictured on the front of the bag! The label should be changed to reflect its intended purpose. It's like saying a can of regular soda is calorie free if you list it as being 42 servings. That said, I will still be using it since it has less than a third of the calories of sugar, about a quarter of the carbs and tastes very good. Their shady lack of disclosure on the bag leaves a bad taste in my mouth. But while it's not a no calorie sweetener, but it is pretty close to ideal.

 What is this again??,1,"Well, I'll begin by saying that I was really looking forward to this product. I tried TruVia's erythritol/stevia sweetener when I ran out of the stevia sweetener that I used before and wanted to get something instead of plain sugar. I figured that I liked the mix and wanted to try this powder because I had already ordered stevia from Superstore. When it got here I used it right away, and did not taste the difference. I was very conservative in adding this to my coffee because I didnt know how sweet it was. After adding 3 large spoonfuls into my coffee I gave up, and I usually add 1 spoonful of sugar to my cup. if you want a sugar free sweetener that you can even make at home, get stevia. I have used it from local health food stores and always ended up with that funny aftertaste from stevia. the one I ordered from Superstore, sweetleaf vanilla creme didnt have that aftertaste, and I used 12 drops in my coffee looking for it, typically I only use 4 drops in my coffee. …",8 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Great Idea That Works Well Until Your Cat Outsmarts You,5,"I have two cats, one is mine and the other is my girlfriends. My cat, although he isn't thrilled with getting the occasional ""tummy pill,"" does do pretty well with them and doesn't usually throw too bad of a fit. My girlfriend's cat on the other hand, is quite the opposite. That little **** will throw one of the biggest fits you ever seen when you attempt to give him a pill. You would think that we are trying to give him a bath he throws such a fit, which is another story all together! Anyhow, we bought some of these ""pill hiding treats"" in an attempt to get him to take his medicine without the daily fight that is usually attached to the act of pill taking. The very first time we tried them we were both a bit apprehensive wondering if we had just wasted some money on treats instead of the normal band-aids which come in quite handy at pill time. Needless to say, these ""pill pockets"" worked! We were literally amazed the first time that we gave him one with a pill in it and he actually gulped it down without even tasting it. Oh, what joy swept through our household. Little did we know that it was only going to last about 2 weeks. Just enough time for use to become complacent as far as the daily pill act was concerned. Sure enough, we were once again outsmarted by the cat. Approximately two weeks into the ""pill hiding treat"" debacle, we started finding his pill on the floor but no sign of the pill pocket. We soon discovered that the little **** was chewing the pill pocket off from around the pill and eating it without eating the pill. Now we give him several ""pill hiding treats"" throughout the day, and only one of them has the pill in it, but he never knows which one it is. Although we never put it in the very first one, or the very last one. This has been working now for about a month, but I figure were running out of time on this one and had better start thinking up a new plan of attack before we are once again outsmarted by the cat.

 May be our nation's only hope!!,5,"As we all know, the world is about to be consumed by a massive blob of crude oil gushing out of a hole in the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. The oil rig that made the hole in the Gulf floor in the first place was owned by a little Mom & Pop concern called British Petroleum. ""BP"" is a scrappy little underdog of an oil company that was just trying to compete with the other giant, evil oil companies. They are the noble little corner grocer whilst other oil companies are analogous to Wal-Mart and as such the oil rig used by BP didn't have all the bells and whistles of the oil rigs used by the ""Big Box"" oil companies, bells and whistles like a simple battery that was supposed to have powered the alarm system that would have stopped this entire disaster from happening. You just know those batteries have got to be VERY expensive if it's cheaper to take a chance on a disaster that will cause untold and possibly global economic and environmental damage. We can't hold the lack of obviously expensive safety equipment against BP however, as oil companies operate on the slimmest of margins and usually don't return much of a profit to The Stockholders, who are people too. BP tried to stop the gusher with something called a Top Hat and then a Hot Tap. These didn't work so they moved to their well thought out and scientifically tested Plan C, which was to stop the oil gusher by shooting golf **** into it. Surprisingly this didn't work so they attempted to shoot other things into the hole, up to and including: tennis ****, those tiny sponge dinosaurs that grow to enormous size when you get them wet, Swanson Hungry Man dinners(abandoned when deemed more dangerous to ocean life than the oil cloud), a gelatinous sludge vacuumed out from behind Kirstie Alley's knees and the entirety of Rush Limbaugh.( Adding Rush to a monstrous cloud of oil only resulted in a larger and more powerful Limbaugh, which is still being combated by the military as I write this). Luckily, those feisty little can-doers down at BP hit upon a sure fire idea. They are going to shoot thousands of tons of fresh whole rabbits into the hole. Why will this work when the other methods failed to produce results? Let me answer your question with a question of my own...What is the universal symbol of luck in modern society? The rabbit's foot. And these whole rabbit carcasses are lousy with them. BP engineers have determined that these rabbit carcasses, because of the association between rabbit feet and superstitious luck, have a greater chance of plugging that hole than almost any other method. A wise man once said that any problem the mind of man can set, the mind of man can solve. So I'm not worried folks, this time things are sure to work out. If they don't however, I'd warn any leprechauns you care about to leave the country for a long, long time. …",12 out of 26 users found this review helpful
