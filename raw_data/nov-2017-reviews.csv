 It's a Cherry Jubilee !,5,"Being a person with almost no patience, I had to open the Superstore package that arrived today within seconds of it's delivery. Inside was the box of cherries, that box was opened too as was the package of dried cherries inside. Plucked a cherry from the package just to have a quick taste before running off to work for the day. The taste stopped me dead in my tracks !! Really, it did. I just had to grab a sandwich bag and fill it with cherries to take with me. These cherries are absolutely delicious, fresh, soft and chewy, sweet but not too sweet, a little firm and not at all hard and they are full flavored. No kidding, I ate a herd of them today. Can't wait to have a day off to try cooking with them... imagine the possibilities: Cherry Scones, biscuits, NY Cheesecake with dried cherries stirred in the recipe, on cereal in the morning, Oh! what about cherry pancakes or waffles? Maybe add a few crushed walnuts or pecans. In a salad with cherry vinaigrette dressing maybe add a few pine nuts and a few grates of cheddar cheese. Trail mix with dried cherries? Cherry cobbler, cherry oatmeal cookies, chicken in cherry sauce. Yep, I'm going to be doing some cooking. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 It's Dead!,1,"I bought this for my kids since they wanted a bunny for Easter. I remember getting a bunny when I was their age. So I typed ""Rabbit"" into the search function here on Superstore and ordered this and opted for the optional gift wrapping. Imagine the look on the faces of little Jimmy and Suzie when they opened this up on Easter morning. They cried the whole day and it really made the Easter Egg hunt a downer. If you buy this product please understand that it is dead. It may have been alive when it was first packed but the box didn't have any holes in it. …",64 out of 72 users found this review helpful
 That's a lot of breadsticks.,4,"I read this wrong, I guess. I thought I was going to get a box of 12 breadsticks so I put ""2"" in for quantity. Well, turns out I was really ordering 2 CASES of 12 boxes EACH. Funny. That explains why it cost me more than $50. I guess I just thought they were that special. They're good. And they are approved on my ""diet"" so I love them. Just, if you are going to order 2...make sure you want 2 cases. lol …",45 out of 48 users found this review helpful
 Good Tree,4,"I bought this bonsai as a gift. It came within a week, and was well packaged. I'm posting this review on the second day, so I'm waiting to see how it survives. It came in a rectangular pot instead of a circle like the one in the picture. That I don't mind. It was also very healthy. Wish it had a drainage tray. I see people saying that theirs is nothing like the picture. I guess the style of tree will vary depending on who you buy it from, since there are different buying choices. I got mine from Sheryl Shop. Update Check your bonsai for spider mites. Mine got infected before I knew what they were, and died within a year and a half after buying. Was still a nice tree though. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Plain & simple: THIS STUFF WORKS,4,"I originally found out about this product because it was given out as a 1 ounce sample on a flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico to New York JFK in January. Genius marketing on the part of Dove - whoever thought to hand out a sample size lotion to a flight of sun-drenched dry-skinned passengers should be given a raise because I'm positive I wasn't the only one to go out and buy a full size when I got home. The lotion worked perfectly to calm and moisturize my VERY dry and itchy sun dried skin. And everyone else on the plane seemed to feel the same way. I bought a full size as soon as the sample size ran out, and I'm still loving it - it goes on silky smooth, absorbs very quickly, and really helps combat winter dryness. The best moisturizer I've ever used, hands down - except for one thing - the smell. I wish they would make an unscented or fragrance free version. The scent is very perfume-y and will clash with any perfume or other fragrance you may be wearing. DOVE - please make an unscented version. Other than the scent, this lotion works great and I will buy it again and would recommend it to anyone who has dry winter skin. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Amazingly Good!,5,"I do not like pre-cooked pork rinds, not even made fresh in the Mexican Carnecerias, but hubby likes them, so I decided to buy these. I was shocked to find that they were light, airy and crispy. Some bags were saltier than others, but we've cooked up about 5 so far and the majority aren't overly salty. Another reviewer mentioned watching them to figure out how long the cooking time should be. In our 1100 watt oven 40-43 seconds seems to be just right. The key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated. Leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy. Since I follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons, I like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs. I'm still trying to come up with more dip ideas that will go well with the flavoring. I wish they'd put out a version that didn't have seasoned salt as I'd like them with just salt and/or garlic. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 Best cheese curls - UPDATED: overpriced and poor quality,5,"I won't say I'm an expert in cheese curls, but these sure taste great. Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Superstore price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective. UPDATE December 11, 2009 Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag ""freshness guaranteed."" That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients). I'd give this one star today if I could. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Great Garbanzos,5,"Upon receiving the product, I started a batch soaking to get them ready to cook. I soaked the beans overnight and cooked them up in the pressure cooker (after watching Good Eats episode on garbanzos/chickpeas). I am very happy with the quality of the beans. The cooked up tender and tasty. I used some in a soup, added some to a couple of salads and blended the rest up to make hummus. Each time I reflected on how much better I liked them over canned beans (even when cooked unsalted) and the last batch of dried chick peas I bought in the store. The burlap bag is kind of cool and the beans are in a plastic bag inside of that. Out of four cups of measured uncooked beans, I only encountered two beans that did not cook up soft. I will buy these again. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 A VERY FINE GRAPE SEED OIL,5,"I use this oil for cosmetic purposes, mostly as a catalyst carrier oil for Ormus and essential oils, and it is of very high quality and fineness and absorbs quickly into the skin. It has no off smell or color, is a top shelf oil and no doubt would be a primo cooking oil if any were left over for me to use it. The deal with people having issues with dents in the containers is not an issue for me, there was a small indentation on one of the cans but I could have made it myself prying the cans out of the shrink wrap. As long as the oil is in the cans I am good. Again, these are not decorative items for me, but utilitarian containers. Love the oil. You will, too. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Reboot your snack processors,5,"I wanted to give these soy crisps more justice than just the 5 stars (and ordering them all the time). I bought a bag of these Sea Salt flavor crisps and a bag of BBQ crisps about a month ago, in a bid to eat more healthy food. I've always loved BBQ chips, especially Ruffles and Lays K.C. Masterpiece chips, but they've got to be killing me slowly, right? So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged. How could this be BBQ? They tasted like cardboard, and I gave them to my friends who will eat anything. I begrudgingly opened the Sea Salt bag, and though more palatable, I was still disappointed. (I know...""I thought you said 5 stars."" It gets better.) Anyway, I had sworn off chips and midday snacking, so for two weeks I saw nothing on the counter but Genisoy Soy Crisps. I'd eat two or three here and there, and when I ran out, I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again. What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive--my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like, and I started craving Soy Crisps. I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor, like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars, which I had completely missed before, apparently because it wasn't a sweet, red-crusted, overbearing BBQ powder. I polished the next bags off in three days. Now, I'm ordering 12 here on Superstore ($1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food). My advice is this--give these soy crisps a chance, but don't mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you'll think they're awful. Stop eating, for a month, the oily BBQ chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips. You'll feel better about snacking! …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Over Powering,3,It comes in a plastic jar. The toasty taste and smell are to over powering for me. Leaves me feeling a little queasy. Otherwise its a nice oil and I can buy it at the local Martians grocery store. I can't eat it alone and even in my morning oatmeal its still to much. If you love an over powering taste and smell of coconut you will probably love this product if you don't then pass on this one. …,9 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 It's Helping Clear my Acne/ I wrote a lot but its worth reading if u suffer from acne,4,"The Manuka Honey 12+ In my opinion is really good for clearing bad acne. I use it as a cleanser for my face. Starting after the Holidays of last year 2009, after New Years My skin broke out really bad. So i was beginning 2010 with skin that was going out of control. I started using Acne free which contains 2.5 Benzoyl Peroxide which has helped clear my skin in the past but it actually made it worst. then I started using Herpanacine 100 vegicaps supplements and that really broke me out to the max. I had big acne cysts around my jaw line. so I realized the supplements is supposed to do that and it's because i had toxins in my body. Then I started using [...] products because they also use 2.5 BP which helped me before. But I noticed my skin looked dull and tho it was clearing i just hate the fact using chemicals for the rest of my life to help clear my acne. then I used mario Badescu products. i was just willing to find anything to help... so I wanted a natural alternative. i was sick of using chemicals. I found a youtube page where this lady cleared her acne with organic raw honey and a aloe vera plant. so I first bought the 365 Organic Raw Honey from wholefoods which is AWESOME!! which i still use. then she mentioned the manuka raw organic 12+.. so i had to try it.. within three weeks my skin was glowing. So I wash my face with either honey, the 365 organic wildflower Raw honey or wedderspoon raw organic manuka honey 12+.. then pat dry. then at night I use the gel from a aloe vera plant. not aloe vera juice or gels they sell in stores in a container. it's best to use the actual plant and use the gel it has. rub it on your face everynight. it helps with the redness and complexion. it really help make my skin glow. another thing i do as a skin regimen is add 3 tsp of 365 organic raw honey with 1 tsp of cinnamon powder and mix as a paste. i use that as a face mask. put it where u have acne for two weeks! it really works.. i still use it and it helps clear really fast.wash it off after 30 min to 2hrs. another thing that really HELPS!!! is juicing cucumber with apple or pears.. but the main ingredient is the CUCUMBER..to making ur own juice using a blender or a juicer. it's really helping clear my acne. hope it helps u! i added the links below that is saving my skin! good luck!

My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two. At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful.

I cancelled our order with caiman and tried to order thru Superstore itself the same day Feb 3rd i believe. Here it is March the 20th. No nothing , just an endless extending wait.

It is extremely salty, slightly beerish and very savoury. So far I have mostly consumed it with bread and butter...but I have already started taking tastes straight from the jar. I also find I like it better with whole wheat bread than white. I think the main challenge for the uninitiated is that it looks like it might be sweet. It is not sweet at all and you should use it very sparingly mixed with plenty of butter, at least at first. Sadly, my husband also likes it and my supply is dwindling rapidly.

 Zevia Cola - My second experience with stevia sweetened soda,4,"Zevia Ginger Ale was my first experience with a soda sweetened with the natural sweetner Stevia. As a result of my good experience, I bought a six-pack of Zevia Cola from my local natural foods store. The associate told me they sell out very quickly. I will be purchasing other flavors to try as well. Taste: 3 stars - I used to be a huge fan of Diet Coke. There is a definite after-taste created by Stevia, and it will take a little getting used to. However, this is the case for any diet drink. Someone that is not used to diet sodas might not immediately enjoy them. After continuing to drink Zevia, the after taste becomes less noticeable. This soda seems a tad bit sweeter than a regular Coke and not quite a sweet as a Diet Coke. The cola flavor could definitely be stronger. Calories: 5 stars - No calories! Can't argue with that. Ingredients: 5 stars - It's all natural. If you aren't familiar with Stevia, look it up on your favorite search engine. The sweetner has no calories and is natural, unlike the Aspartame found in a Diet Coke. Overall Rating: 4 stars - When it comes to no calories and natural ingredients, I'm willing to accept a slight decrease in taste. That's why I'm giving Zevia Cola 4 stars. Unfortunately in this case, the cola taste is not quite as strong as it should be, and the Stevia seems to overpower the cola flavor. The only way to know if you'll like it is to give it a try. Superstore sells these for a better price than you will find in stores, but if you want to try it first, you can probably purchase these in smaller quantity at a natural foods store. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Best Cat Food!,4,"When we adopted our cat, she had spent 9 months in a cage at the humane society. She was scrawny, cranky, and not happy.

 woah baby,5,":: English Toffee Flavored Liquid Stevia :: Amazing how intensely rich this is! It totally tastes like sweet english toffee. How thay accomplish so much flavor in these zero cal little droplets, that's a voodoo mystery to me. My one complaint is that they don't give any hints of their tricks to get the english toffee flavor. I know that stevia is already magic in itself for its sweetness power, but wondered about how they managed to get the strong english toffee swing in there. On package label, all they have to say, basically, is ""Natuarl flavors"". Unfortunately staying more secretive than I'd have preferred. But I can forgive them that one decision. Since overall: this stuff is a great treat, while leaving your conscience clean on matters of substances in the body.

 A Slacker Mom's dream,5,"I love this gadget. Compact, all-in-one, easy to use, FOOL PROOF, and ... gives me the CONFIDENCE to make my baby's food. I've read tons of web reviews and blogs about this product, and detractors seem to miss/misunderstand my 'category' of mom. I cook when I can. I bake when I get the chance but... mostly, I dont have the time or confidence to pull it off anything 'new'... AND clean up multiple utensils! So many blogs out there chastise the Beaba buyers for wasting money--telling us to buy cheap steamer inserts and dust off our blenders, food processors and food mills... For my first baby, I listened to these moms (and the Beaba wasnt in the USA yet). I bought the food mill; I pulled out the steamer insert... and.. I froze. My baby ate NOTHING BUT JARRED (organic) FOOD! till she could chew the foods in my comfort zone. Baby food, all the prep and the coordination of all these tools was all so daunting. I was terrified I'd get it wrong... or couldnt keep sterile enough... or would get lost in all the piles of things I'd have to clean after each prep!! THEN THE BEABA! Little to clean, nothing to get wrong, no digging through drawers and juggling appliances in my limited space! I LOVE IT! Call me a slacker mom! But dont call me frivolous with money!! Organic Baby food is $1.10 a jar and my baby would go through 4-6 a day. I've had my Beaba for 6 weeks, and it's already paid for itself. BTW, you can adjust the consistency to your baby's taste as he grows. I figure soon I'll just be using it to steam, not blend. And... I doubt it will be a permanent fixture in my kitchen! But ... its paid for itself! Carrots smell like carrots!!! and ... its given me a confidence that I hope extends to other culinary projects! Slacker moms, buy it. PS Careful if you're reading those blogs re: Beaba and BPA. Read ALL the blogs. The most uptodate will lead you to the latest info promising this product IS BPA free. There are blogs that appear current but have not updated this info. …",488 out of 496 users found this review helpful

They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food. This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school. Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness. Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.

 Impressed again,5,"I first tried the Pineapple flavor and was waiting to try the Original to cast my final rating. I'm still very impressed. While nothing beats a fresh coconut, this is a great alternative. I'm a coconut water addict and consume anywhere from 1-3 cans a day. This adds up in $$$. For people like me, who drink coconut water everyday and use electrolyte replacement mixes in my water bottle when i'm biking, this is a dream come true. My kid actually loves eating the powder straight! I recommend this product for people who love coconut water as much as I do, are aware of the environmental impact shipping coconut water around the world, packaging waste, want it all the time (like me) and like the convenience of the powder. For purists, stick with the fresh coconut. But for price, flavor, environmental impact and convenience, CocoHydro is awesome! Thanks CocoHydro for making this product! It's a great creation! …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 It's a win win thing.  And I even like the smell!,5,"The skin is a great delivery system for absorbing things into your body. So what are you putting on your skin? Read the ingredients on your handcream or body lotion. Are they good for you? Don't know? Can you even pronounce them? Let's keep it simple. Virgin organic coconut oil. Snowy white, unrefined, heavenly smell - this stuff is terrific!! Solid at room temperature, smooth and buttery and melts at 76 degrees; cook/fry with it on low heat for a healthy and fragrant alternative to all those ulgy refined oils and hydrogenated trans fats (YUCK!), use as a lighter butter or shortening alternative (there's not a lot of flavor and the smell is intoxicating); use as hand cream (rub it on - only gets greasy if you really over load the area) I use it as a body lotion all over my body (my skin feels soft and smooth like it did when I was a child), hair conditioner (a light deep conditioner); anti-fungal properties (put it between your toes for goodness sake!) make-up remover - voila! ear wax? I put a tiny bit of this on a q-tip; moist toilette wipes? ssshh... try a touch of this on your t.p. - and I could go on and on... It must be organic and virgin coconut oil - anything else is something else and unexceptable. I understand that it is fine for diets, and speeds up the metabolism (its those little medium fatty acid chains). Don't take my word for it - read all about it for yourself! And yes, I feed it to my dog and cat, my cat loves it - and he won't eat anything! Actually, I don't think that he can resist the smell, I can't!

 terminally mediocre (in my hands),2,"My experience is quite different to most other reviewers, so perhaps it will be a helpful counterpoint. I used Droste to make a test cake for my son's birthday, and it had no detectable chocolate flavor. I then just tasted the Droste cocoa and found it awfully bland. I picked up a can of Pernigotti cocoa from Williams-Sonoma: horribly expensive, but produced quite a good chocolate cake from the same recipe. For baking, if you are a foodie, Droste will be disappointing. If you are limited to supermarket selections I would look for a recipe that calls for melted chocolate, perhaps in addition to cocoa, and use Lindt chocolate: the result should be more chocolate-tasting. If you have more money and/or resources, Callebaut cocoa (from Superstore or another mail-order place) is terrific, Green & Black also performs well and is popular with pastry chefs (it is organic, so look for it at organic shops or at Whole Foods), and as mentioned I found Pernigotti to perform well (find at Williams-Sonoma or a gourmet shop). Hope this is helpful. An earlier reviewer commented that Dutched cocoas will produce more flavor: Dutching is an alkalizing treatment used to bring the cocoa taste forward. All Dutch-processed cocoas are not the same, however, and have different pH levels as well as dramatically different flavors. For more on this see Rose Levenbaum's ""Cake Bible"" or hit the Cook's Illustrated website. Rose recommends Green & Black's on her blog, and Cook's Illustrated recommends Callebaut as the best cocoa they reviewed (they did find Droste to be the best supermarket brand), although of the three cocoas I suggest only Callebaut was included in the Cook's Illustrated taste test. …",93 out of 108 users found this review helpful

 Playing With Fire,5,"I've been experimenting with ways to give my guacamole an extra kick. After receiving this industrial solvent in the mail, I called some buddies over for burritos, beer and baseball. Cut to fifteen minutes later: four men are sitting around, watching baseball and drinking beer as it dawns on them that there is an angry dragon writhing about in each of their stomachs. The dragons breathe white hot fire that scorches their mouths and ravages their tongues. Ever men, they remain erect and try to soothe the dragon's temper with gifts of alcohol. Quickly, though, the supply dwindles and furtive glances dart around the room. Who will break first? As sweat drips down their foreheads and stings their eyes, they try to think about baseball...think about baseball...think about baseball...and then one makes a break for it! In an instant there is a stampede for the kitchen. They fling open the refrigerator and, snorting like wild bulls, rip open another case and chug like Dionysus reborn--but to no avail. This alcohol is fueling the fire and not dousing it. With choked and gasping breath one whispers ""milk"". Upending the kitchen they can find none of the sweet elixir. With tears streaming down their faces they tear outside, but in the rush of flailing limbs they fall into a heap on the pavement. ""Oh no"" they say, realizing the horrible truth. In their haste to quench this insatiable heat they made a fatal mistake: they are way too drunk to drive. Rising from the ground, they take off on foot for the nearest corner store. Soon, none can bear to breathe through their mouths; the dragon's flames lick at their lips unbearably. As they breathe heavily through their noses, their sinuses are soon aflame from the intense heat and begin their own form of self defense. What a spectacle! Four grown men with red faces, streaming eyes and snot flying into the wind as they gasp and wheeze down the road, driven by the fires of hell itself. Soon, the fat one falls, hitting the ground hard but stretching his hands out for help. Through the sneezing and wheezing no words can escape his ruined lips. Onward the three friends push with nary a backward glance. ""We will remember you fondly, fat one"" they say to themselves, hearts roasted free of compassion. They burst into the corner store as one drunken, moaning entity of pure thirst and claw their way to the milk. With wild abandon, they forego such modern niceties as payment and immediately pour gallons of soothing white mana into their gaping, flaming maws. They sink to the floor in the silent thanks of men spared the gallows. One thought lingers in their minds: ""that guac sure was tasty."" …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful

Google Roni Sue, a small company out of New York that infuses their maple bacon lollipops with tea, or Lollyphile, who makes giant lollipops that taste like maple and bacon.

Hopefully, the Superstore webmaster will correct the description so that the next buyer knows exactly what he/she is paying for - 1 box of cookies.

" Not as healthy as plain raisin bran, but sure tastes good!",4,"A quick glance at the nutrition panel will show that this has less fiber but more sugar than regular raisin bran. But, the taste makes it worth it - very crunchy, plump raisins, a real treat! My only criticism is that it is a bit too sweet. To balance the sweetness, I mix it with regular raisin bran (or other bran-heavy cereals). Makes for that comfortable middle ground. Great price when it goes on sale on Superstore.

 Excellent Stuff!,5,"Although the Sun Brand Madras curry powder tastes a little different from other brands that were listed on Superstore a couple of years ago, this stuff is still excellent! It has a slightly deeper orange hue than other Madras curries I've come across, so don't be too surprised if your curry isn't as yellow. If you purchased the Roland curries (red, cylindrical container; also in 1 pound lots), be aware that the Sun Brand is a little saltier and spicier so you won't need to use as much! I love making curried chicken legs with an apple jelly-based sauce, and this brand of powder goes just as well as the others I've tried. If you plan on following recipes from Cuisine at Home and other similar publications, you're going to need a *lot* of curry, and purchasing through Superstore is the best (and cheapest) method available. I typically purchase between 4 and 8 pounds every year or two from Superstore, and nothing makes for a better method of entertaining guests than an exotic (but not quite Indian) dish with an American twist! Edit: It seems some other reviews mention the strong, salty flavor of this curry. I don't notice it so much for what I use it for, but if you're trying to watch your sodium intake, be aware that this curry might contain FAR more sodium than you'd expect. I'd strongly recommend looking for the Roland Madras curry (you can search for that exact term--but be aware that it isn't often listed because it's VERY popular stuff) as it is of superior quality and flavor. This stuff makes an excellent substitute, though. Also, I neglected to notice a comment to my review some one year ago requesting the recipe I mentioned. Assuming I don't get slapped with a DMCA take down by the magazine I borrowed it from (and modified), I've attached it in the comments to this review.

 My Dog Thinks This Is Her Treat For the Day!,5,"When my vet told me my little Yorkie had stage IV luxating patellas (knees blown out), I was devastated. The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the ""chicken flavor"" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog. On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online. They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition. This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos. As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended ""Golden Aloe"" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well. She's my best friend, I'm on disability and won't be able to afford the surgery if and when it's required so I am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only 3 years old. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 I'm pretty sure this was created as a joke,1,"As my moniker suggests, I LOVE the glorious coffee bean. This, however, has got to be some sort of test....trial by fire-brewed perhaps? At first sight this basket looked delightful. A relatively cheap basket, as is to be expected, filled with goodies. Then comes the unwrapping. The cello wrap was broken, perhaps that is evidence that some sneak removed the 'Jamaican Blend' that is promised but missing. The 'Coffee Box' box was a plain box with a photo copied paper taped to it, which contained 3 Arbuckle single pot bags. The next stuff I am giving a star because of the hearty laugh it gave me... Cafe Vergnano 1882 cookies (4) are ginger-y and a nice complement to the unimpressive but not-too-bad Arbuckle's coffee. The box of 'creamer' contained a few packets of the most generic of office coffee whitener, the brands car repair shops use while you wait to get the oil changed. The 'Sugar in the Raw' was few packets as well. Here is the delightful part. Each box was covered by taped on labels....over empty JELLO BOXES! But wait, it gets better. The coffee stirrers were in an empty Reese's Pieces box! I have this odd visual of rag-clad children being forced to empty Jello and candy boxes day in and day out. If I were the Queen of Back Mountain Baskets...I'd have a ban on scotch tape. I would make sure that the wooden coffee stirrers aren't flavored by the still fragrant Reese's Pieces box. Better creamer or no creamer. I don't mind the diner-esque coffee mug, but perhaps a more trend-on shape would be nice. The individually wrapped cookies/biscuits were quite nice. Perhaps I would add the tiny wrapped bits of chocolate served with coffee in most European cafes. Until all that happens, I think I'd rather have a basket that has the Jello and Reese's intact and original.

 Not as strong as I would have liked,3,"When I first received the bag and opened it, I was in heaven. The smell of this coffee is amazing. However, the taste doesn't measure up to the smell. Some background: I love strong coffee and can't stand the thought of putting sugar in it. So far, I have used this coffee in my espresso machine to make cappuccinos. First, let me comment on the crema. I was expecting more. From reading other reviews, I expected the thickest crema I'd ever seen. In fact, the crema is about the same as with most brands of coffee I use in my machine. Depending upon how fine I grind the coffee, how much coffee I use, and how tightly I pack the coffee, the crema is better or worse. This brand didn't make any noticeable difference. From a flavor standpoint, I find this coffee rather weak. It might be okay straight up as espresso, but once I add steamed milk, it's quite watery. I brewed it side by side with Costco's Kirkland Espresso (Starbuck's roast), and the Kirkland brand is much bolder and more intense. So if you're looking for a strong coffee, one with intense flavor, this isn't the coffee for you. …",11 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Briton's #1 Tea - PG Tips,5,"The folks in the United Kingdom drink more PG Tips tea than any other brand, and perhaps after you try it; it will be your #1 choice, too! (By the way, the folks in Ireland drink more tea per person than in any other country.) PG Tips Tea and PG Tips Special Blend Tea is our home's standard tea. There are a few specialty retailers in the USA that now offer the PG Tips Special Blend Tea and hopefully Superstore will do so soon. In the 1930s (the pre-digestive era in history) this tea was introduced by the name ""Pre-Gest-Tee"" suggesting the tea could be consumed before food was eaten, but it was the grocers who gave it the abbreviation of ""PG"" - and the company added ""tips"" (since the company uses only the best part of the tea plant, the two top leaves and bud of the tea plant to make the tea). Many black teas sold in the USA are graded the basic medium grade Orange Pekoe (generally the tea leaves below the top two and bud), which is one of the reasons PG Tips gets higher reviews than most other teas. PG Tips also uses their pyramid tea bag that allows ample room for the tea to expand as it is infused. Additionally, in my opinion, PG Tips blends only two blends, rather than blending a wide assortment, thus becoming really good at what they do. Here at Superstore PG Tips is priced at just over a nickel a tea bag (a good value for an imported product) when you order the 240 count boxes in a set of two, and even less expensive in the higher volumes. PG Tips makes wonderful ice tea too, and that's good news since Americans drink about 80% of their tea as iced tea and only 20% as hot tea. Worldwide more hot tea is consumed than iced tea, and worldwide tea is the most consumed beverage (next to water), while in the USA it is the sixth most consumed beverage (next to water). A very good question to ponder is ""Why this is?"" Drinking an adequate amount of tea daily is now being considered to be very good for one's health, and it is much more enjoyable to drink a really good cuppa (cup of tea), especially at the nominal cost of about a nickel a cup when compared to one of those gourmet coffee places who charge upwards of four to five dollars for a large cup of coffee. When we have a guest in our home we always offer them a PG Tips cuppa, and they always say they have never tasted a tea this good - thus, I rate it 5 stars for its quality and very nominal price! …",21 out of 23 users found this review helpful

Great product though just misleading price and value advertising. 3 stars only because of the misleading value advertising. …,27 out of 29 users found this review helpful
 The best!,5,"I've been using Xylitol, specifically Emerald Forest's product, for a few years now. It looks and tastes like sugar and can be used for baking too. There have been a few occasions when it didn't quite substitute right, but those are few and far between. Coffee, tea, hot chocolate, macaroons, chocolate chip cookies, brownies...all turn out great. I'm on a no sugar diet (along with no grains) to combat a possible candida problem. Xylitol has been my savior. I still get my little sweet kick now and then without any of the damaging health effects of sugar. And, xylitol is also anti-fungal, so it even helps with things like candida. High recommended! And this price is a total steal too! One 32 ounce can costs nearly $30 at my local health food store. This price can't be beat! …",26 out of 27 users found this review helpful

 Very Good Source of Magnesium,4,"If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too. I have only two problems with the product. First, this particular flavor of Natural Calm neither tastes nor smells all that great: it's sickly sweet. However, there is a non-flavored variety which is great ( Vitality - Natural Calm, oz, 16 powder ). Also, it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage. I've subtracted one star from my rating for those. But, still, I rate this at a Very Good four stars out of five. …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful

" Ahh, finally!",5,"I wondered when Superstore might get around to offering this product. I've loved eating these basic fried and dehydrated noodles for decades, and will be glad to order them by the case. These simple noodles are great with tons of Tabasco--quick and satisfying. The instructions are plain silly, though. My family has always prepared these noodles this way: 1. boil water in a pot, 2. add in the soup base, 3. add in the noodles, and then cook them together till the noodles are soft enough to eat (I like them slightly undercooked). Cooking the noodles in the soup base makes them taste better. Do not overcook, and do not let noodles sit in soup for too long while eating (e.g., longer than half an hour), or noodles will become too soft and fat. Then I pull the noodles out first and douse them with hot sauce--so the hot sauce will cling to the noodles as well as the soup--and then pour in the soup. That vinegary Tabasco taste mixed with the salty noodles and soup is very good. The noodles are also good with an egg--cracked into the pot after the soup base, and cooked together with the noodles. …",24 out of 28 users found this review helpful

 This is not the real thing,2,"This is not the original Swiss Muesli that made this company famous and I've found that in a lot of the stores in this area this is now the only Familia Swiss Meusli available. In my opinion, what they've done is an attempt to make a less costly product ( for them that is} by adding large volume puffed type cereals to the mix. This makes for a lighter product , but with the same size box. The original box weighs 32 ounces, compared to 21 ounces for this new product. Unfortunately, this results in an inferior product, both in taste and nutrition. The real original product is still available in a red box , but I fear they might phase it out if they can get people to go for this cheap imitation. …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 My fave of wheat-free cookies!,5,"Summary: Peanut butter, plain: A bit ""rubbery"". I cooked them a little longer in microwave and added chips. ;^) Peanut butter, choc. chip: Crispy, crunchy, crumbly, rich and VERY addictive! (Yes, they always arrive broken up somewhat, but you won't care.)(Like other chip one, only 5 oz. box) Swirl shortbread: Too heavy and buttery for me. Nice texture. Choc. Chip shortbread: If you like shortbread, this will taste decadent! Rich choc. chips. Crispy and yes, also addictive! (Note: only 5 oz instead of 7 oz. box) Butter shortbread: Couldn't really eat these. Too heavy and buttery. Least favorite. Haven't tried others yet. I have a wheat allergy and never tasted shortbread again until I found these wonderful delights at the store in the health-food section! The shortbread choc chip I tried first has not only the unique taste of shortbread, but has chocolate chunks also! They are crunchy and light. In comparison, they weigh less than some other Pamela products. They are not as ""buttery"" as the Butter Shortbread or Swirl (a good thing in my opinion). I love the pecans also!

 Gold standard...Years of research on my part...,5,"When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my ""baby"" each day. Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life... I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption. I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me) At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud. Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods. The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label. Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this! Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic. I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about. Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out... (p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them! But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!) So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.) Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest... if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal. This is hard to find. So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet. He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!) I, personally, have helped friends CURE ""health"" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept ""treating"" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and ""cured"" them! Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both. I am a raving fan. and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it. …",119 out of 120 users found this review helpful

 Very tastey...and my cat agrees!,5,"This is one of the best tasting nutritional yeasts products I've ever tasted and I've been using nutritional yeast for over 30 years. I am vegan and use yeast for its cheesey, nutty flavor. Bob's is guaranteed gluten free as well! One of my favorite meals is a gluten free pasta tossed with a little flax or extra virgin olive oil, Bragg's liquid aminos and Bob's yeast. I really love it so many ways but interestingly enough I use it more for my 10 year old cat than myself these days! She has adored nutritional yeast since she was a kitten and I sprinkle a generous amount on her kibble every day. It's also very useful sprinkled atop any food I might have to coax her to eat when she is being finnicky. I've always been told that all cats and dogs should have nutritional yeast in their diet to help keep fleas away. Regardless, animals love it so why not give them the extra good nutrition? Superstore's is an excellent buy too, even less expensive than buying bulk at the health food store.

 Excellent buy for organic culinary grade matcha!!!,5,"This organic matcha is great for everyday use!!! I will definitely buy this matcha again and again! I put matcha in smoothies or make tea by the quart with honey. Ceremonial grade matcha is just too expensive to drink everyday by the quart or to load up smoothies with it. This tea has a good, clean flavor that is flavorful enough without being overpowering. I have found it to be delicious in smoothies made with a fresh peach or mango, coconut milk, honey, ice, and a teaspoon of this matcha powder dumped directly into the blender. It is a great way to enjoy the delicate flavor of matcha and the health benefits never tasted so good! You are getting many times over the anti-oxidant effects of green tea from a tea bag because you are actually ingesting the tea leaves when you enjoy matcha. When making matcha as a tea by itself, less is more. I use 1 teaspoon to a whole teapot of steaming (not boiling) water (but I enjoy strong flavors), then I mix in honey after it cools a little. After my morning cup of matcha, I store the remainder of the tea and honey in the fridge for iced matcha later that day. The flavor can be strong by itself, especially if you don't enjoy strong flavors, so it might be a good idea to start with smaller amounts (1/8 teaspoon or less per cup water) and work your way up to suit your individual tastes. Experiment and enjoy! …",33 out of 34 users found this review helpful
 NO waste at all ----  great for training  ----  all dogs love liver treats,5,"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.) Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels). Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs. The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product. There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Here's the nutritional analysis: -100% freeze dried liver -NO additives or preservatives. -Crude protein..... not less than 50% -Crude fat..... not less than 5% -Crude fiber..... not more than 3% -Moisture..... not more than 6% …",39 out of 51 users found this review helpful

 Great product  Easy to use,5,"Great teff flour for making a teff pancake that I eat with everything from stews, to eggs, to cheese, to ethiopian style vegetables. I mix it with slightly more that half filtered water, and let ferment in a 1-1/2 quart covered glass casserole until real bubbly, with a touch of salt and a bit of oil. The trick is in the fermenting. I keep using the old batch as starter and it gets better and ferments faster after several time. (Once you get your starter, it will ferment faster.) I also find the pancake is lighter if you start in the center and spiral the dough as you pour it into a hot pan. If you need it a touch lighter add a pinch of backing soda.
