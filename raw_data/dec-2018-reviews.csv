" Nice mix, but..",3,"I was looking for a mix like McCormicks Medley blend which has the 4 types of peppercorns, coriander and allspice. This was the closest I could find, minus the allspice. This blend has great flavor. The only problem is the coriander is so large that it's hard to get into the grinder and the grinder gets plugged up, having to reverse grind. I do have a very nice William Bounds grinder, so it's not the grinders fault. …",15 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Just like remember !,5,Being French I grew up knowing how important it was to use a good unrefined salt. The one from Brittany being the very best. No! It's not foolish to spent money on a basic spice. It has a very delicate flavor (almost floral) and you don't need a lot. Will taste great on salads. A clear healthy winner. …,12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 FINALLY!!  I'm so glad to finally see this on Superstore!!,5,"I'm so glad to finally see that Superstore is selling and fulfilling this product themselves. I've been buying this at Albertsons lately and getting it 2 for $3.00 which is roughly about the same price on Superstore but of course now I won't have to pay the sales tax and I get it shipped to me via UPS 2nd Day Air for FREE since I'm an Superstore Prime member. I just hope Superstore lowers the price as well as making this one of their Subscribe & Save products. I just ordered 4 of the 12 packs - (1) Lemon, (1) Chocolate, and (2) Spearmint. I'll be so happy if they lower this to around $1.00 or less per bottle. I would then order this stuff like crazy as I hate drinking regular water and am seriously trying to get off diet sodas. P.S. - If you're wondering about the Chocolate flavor - it's awesome. It sounds nasty but is actually good. It taste a bit like your drinking water with one of those green Andes candies in your mouth. If you're trying to cut down or even get off of sweets - this is a good water to drink as it actually satisfies your sweet cravings!! …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 An Excellent Food,5,"Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on. I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference! …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 don't be fooled -- this is NOT white tea!,1,"Maybe I should have said ""this is not 100% white tea."" But then, so should Lipton have said just that. Even though it does not say so in the tea name, the sub-title name, or any of the information anywhere on the box EXCEPT the ingredients list in very very small type (had to get my reading glasses!) -- the second ingredient in this ""white"" tea is green tea. Why? Because white tea is very expensive. It is costly because it is hard, labor intensive work to harvest white tea. If they sold this product made completely out of white tea -- they would not make as much money. But then, they also would not be deceiving their customers. I drink white tea and rooibos red teas because they are naturally either caffeine free, or so low in caffeine that it doesn't give me the migraines which caffeine cause for me. Lipton's deception did cause a migraine. And they have permanently lost a customer because of their intentional deceit. All of the other major tea companies make sure their products are clearly labeled as ""caffeine free,"" ""contains caffeine,"" ""naturally low in caffeine,"" ""those sensitive to caffeine please read ingredients...."" But not Lipton. They made these pretty little pyramid tea bags, but put the same old sad corporate ethics inside. …",9 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Great Concept... Weak Processor,2,"I typically am not a big proponent of single-purpose specialty gadgets, but the Babycook was appealing to me for convenience. The product does deliver in that it significantly reduces dishes/clean up - however the processing function is surprisingly weak. To puree steamed chunks of carrots takes far longer to pulse than what the manual implies. I have to pulse & scrape down multiple times before foods are completely pureed - something I would definitely not have to do with a food processor or even a blender. I was very surprised not to have seen this shortcoming mentioned in reviews as of yet, but perhaps my expectations are a bit higher because I do cook on a very frequent basis. Although I love the idea of having an easy machine to whip up fresh baby food, I'll likely return it and use a steamer + food processor for better results. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 great!,5,I purchased this for the first time and am very satisfied with the product and taste. It is a wonderful substitute for sugar in my coffee and cereal. I have gotten used to using no sugar so this is a treat. One tablespoon is 30 calories but I don't use more than a teaspoon. If it is really low glycemic that is a huge advantage for all those who suffer with diabetes. I highly recommend trying this. …,12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Excellent Source of Magnesium,5,"If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too. I've also tried a flavored version of this product (Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder). Unlike that version, this stuff is entirely odorless, and the only taste is a sense of tartness. I much prefer this non-flavored version over the flavored version. The only problem I have with this product is that it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage. That's pretty insignificant. So, I still rate it at an Excellent five stars out of five. Highly recommended. Especially if you're taking calcium. …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 My picky dogs eats every piece!,5,"I have a three year old yorkipoo who has always been extremely picky about his food. We had some success (by ""some success"" I mean he'd eat half of what he was supposed to) with the Prarie brand by Natures Variety, but he always had runny eye problems and had trouble keeping weight on. My mother's vet recommended the Wellness brand for her dog to lose weight and suggested I try the small breed formula for my picky dog. I'm so glad I tried it! Since switching my dog to the Wellness small breed formula my dog eats every single piece. I don't have to sit there and encourage him to eat. He willingly eats the whole bowl and cannot wait for his next meal. I'm convinced that I could feed him 5 times a day and he'd still eat every last piece because its just that good. I have never seen him so excited to eat! On top of this his coat is as soft as ever and his watery, running, cloudy eyes are completely clear. He has the same amount of small dog energy but doesn't seem as anxious when I leave (apparently filler in dog foods can cause anxiety in sensitive dogs). I'm amazed at how great this product is working for my little man. Highly recommend for those with picky, small breed dogs. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 The price is right,5,"We have a little Maltese that we spoil to no end. These treats are the perfect size for him and he loves them. He can be a little picky. Among his daily treats are Greenies and since we found these on Superstore, Zuke's Jerky Naturals. I will say that we tried two different kinds. Along with these, we tried the WellBites Chicken and Venison Recipe Dog Treats, 8-Ounce Pouch . The Zuke's are really potent. When you open the bag, you catch a big whiff of how strong they are. They're probably real flavorful because of it (I didn't try one). The Wellness treats seem a little dryer. While our little guy likes both of the treats, the Zuke's win over the Wellness. Plus they're cheaper so that's even better. He can't get enough of them. We also tried the Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch made by Zuke's. He doesn't like those as much as the Greenies. I would say that this product is one of the best we found for our dog. Plus we were able to take advantage of the free super saver shipping as well. These are highly recommended. [Edit: August 14, 2011] He still loves them! We've had to start giving our little guy Remedel for a little shoulder injury he had. These Zukes make it real easy to give him the pill. Since they're moist, we just put the pill inside and press it all around the pill. That way he doesn't even know he's taking it. Trying to give him pills with the Wellness treats doesn't work so well since they're dryer. [Edit: September 29, 2012] Anyone else notice that they seem different?? The last couple packs we bought were dryer and brittle. They also weren't as potent as the other ones were. He doesn't seem to like them as much any more. I don't know if the bags we bought were partially opened so they dried out by the time the were delivered or if their recipe changed. I'll buy some more and see how they turn out.

 xylitol,4,"As described by other reviewers, I just wanted to add in response to an above revie, I have successfully used this with a yeast recipe. All you have to do is proof the yeast in the beginning with a teaspoon of real sugar to make it foam and then you can use xylitol as the sweetener in the recipe.

 Great taste! But... packaging needs rework?,4,"Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna Treats / B004867T24 My cats don't like treats, so I'm always on this constant search to find treats that maybe they *will* like. And then I'll teach them to do the tango, or something -- I'm hazy on that part. But, anyway, I was thrilled when this packet came in the mail; the cats had their noses in the air and were meowing at me before I had the mail packet open. This tuna smells *good* and it must taste good, too, since they were nose-deep in it immediately and chowed down. So I can vouch that my kitties loved the taste of this ""treat"". Everything else about the ""treat"" seems odd to me, though. For starters, these aren't ""treats"" in the ""here's a little nibble"" sense. There are three slabs of tuna in here, and while I guess you could pick them into tiny pieces and give slivers to the cats, they look like they're meant to be eaten as a whole meal. And they're really big: one of my cats skipped dinner later after having this snack, and the chubby ""always hungry"" one looked askance at the treat halfway through, like she was getting full and wasn't sure what to do about it. So I'd recommend not serving a whole stick to the cats, but breaking it into pieces. The problem here is that it's not really easy to get the packet open. The resealable part of the packet wouldn't open for me at all, so I had to cut the packet open, and tuna juice got everywhere. Then the first stick broke in half when I was sliding it out, and I couldn't easily reach in and get the rest without breaking the other sticks. Eventually I just crumbled everything up and served it in handfuls, and that seemed to work, but was pretty messy -- you probably can't use these for training. In the end, my cats liked the treat, but I wonder if they wouldn't have liked just as much a small can of tuna from the store since this was basically a tuna meal. I think if you wanted to replace their meals with the occasional ""treat"" like this, this would be a great buy, but if you're wanting little nibblers for the cats to train with, pass this by.

 Ekobrew Washer Hack,4,"When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good. I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer. If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past. The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer. The washer I used is rubber, 1/16"" thick, 5/32"" inside diameter, and 3/8"" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493. …",232 out of 235 users found this review helpful
 Ate Them As A Kid! Still Good!,5,"When I was a kid I ate slim jims all the time. I am glad that they still taste the same. Unfortunately, nowadays they like to change and mess with too many of the things that we grew up with and loved as children. Here's what I used to do (and still do): I get the end real wet until the skin gets to the point that you can slough it off without breaking it. I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it's all gone. Then I grab another and do it all over again! And I don't care how many of these you'll try to eat in a week -- a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time! This is a good buy!

 Essential!,5,"We have been eating hempseeds for sometime - they are an essential part of our diet. I genuinely notice a difference physically when I eat them along. This is a good price and we have gotten good quality from Superstore. PLEASE SHARE SOME WITH YOUR FRIENDS!! We must work together to make this available to the USA INCLUDING the farmers. We live under an oppressive, authoritarian regime which, only a few years ago, would have attacked you for eating what is literally ""birdseed"". Wild! 2nd Review w/Suspcription Purchase Method We have been delighted to have hemp seed finally taken off Schedule 1 Controlled Substance (along with heroin, etc.). I know that is insane to even write this but that is the nature of the degenerate and immoral drug policy barons from the DEA and ONDCP - to twist reality and prohibit what are supposed to be free American citizens from obtaining some of the best food known to mankind beause their pseudo fear of people smoking flowers(and then engaging in violence against these same peaceful, free human beings). NUTS indeed!! In any event, we have started using the suscription method. This is a great price compared to anywhere else that I have found. It actually takes 4 mos for us to go through 5 lbs. Therefore, I signed up for 2 mos and simply skip one. I will give very great KUDOS to Superstore for how they have set this up - at least for this product, both the product and the system work great!

 Impressively YUMMY,5,"These were priced right so to be frank, my expectations were a bit low. Boy was I pleasantly surprised when a delightfully packed box (appropriate for gift giving) was delivered with six different varieties of dried mushrooms, presentation stuffing, recipe ideas etc...the overall effect is quite nice and makes a wonderful gift idea. The first we tried were the morels - although you can certainly find much more expensive ones, I was very pleasantly surprised how good these were especially given the price of the entire box. Frankly, they tasted much better than expected. Next were the shiitake which are one of my favorite mushrooms and I tend to be very picky about them...most of the time I purchase them fresh but always keep some dried on hand for those ""cooking emergencies"" (I use a lot of shrooms when cooking). In fact, I had just ordered a pound of dried shiitake from another vendor...these were FAR surperior (unfortunately, I'm stuck with a pound of not so good ones...USA organic made at that!). Each has been equally pleasant and far in excess of my (admittedly modest) expectations. Frankly, these would easily pass for double the cost I paid...in fact, I liked this set so much, I hesitated to give it such a good rating because I was afraid they would jump the price up! As soon as I work through my present selection from the other inferior company, I intend to purchase more dried and fresh mushrooms from this Earthy.

 My Dog's Favorite- and Superstore's the Place to Get Them!,5,"My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict. She knows when they're in the house. She knows which cupboard they're kept in. She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers. Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face. I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit. My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive. There's no denying that. If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece. So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand. As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats. I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day. If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine. You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Superstore's the place to get them. …",25 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 THIS CURES ECZEMA! Worth getting for ANY reason!,5,"__________________________________________________________________________________ NOTE: I have left an update on my eczema condition in the comments section of this review.

The delicious nutty flavor makes it easy to take this as a daily supplement. The texture will take some getting used to if you're taking it straight as a supplement (it is oil after all). And you can't beat the price here on Superstore. The original price is $20 and here it's half that! I actually decided to get this because I heard an omega6 deficiency causes eczema (a skin disease that I have). I've been taking it for about a week and my skin is showing improvement. I itch less and my skin doesn't inflame as badly. I'm thinking I need to up the dose a little bit. Maybe I'll start taking 1 full tablespoon instead of 2 teaspoons that I'm taking daily. I understand this probably won't be of use to most people simply looking for hemp seed oil, but I will update in the comments of this review about how my eczema curing progress is going. Maybe this can help someone. Nutiva is obviously very passionate and dedicated to the products they sell. The label on this oil is informative and their website is even more informative.

 Tried for first time last night,5,"I tried this flour for the first time last night. Amazing results. I have been making homemake pizza for 20+ years now and always used bread or high-gluten flour.

King Arthur offers ""00"" flour but I always thought the protien content was tool low, looked more like cake flour then something I would want to use for pizza. Surfing the other day I came across this flour and read about how much people loved it for making pizza. Seeing that it had a higher protien content (11% compared to KA's 8.5%) I though I would give it a try. Well based on last nights results I'm a fan and may never go back to HG flour again for pizza.

 What's In This Stuff?,3,"I didn't buy this from Superstore, and the reason I didn't is that the product description does not give details about what is in this product. The Miracle-Gro website was equally uninformative. Thus, I went to a ""big box store,"" picked up a container, read the ingredients, and bought it. My main concern was whether the product contained magnesium, manganese, iron, and calcium, as many of the websites on palm care recommend fertilizers containing these ingredients. The tiny print on the back of the container lists all of these elements except calcium. The label on the back of the container also lists copper, zinc, and sulphur. The fertilizer ratio is 8 - 8 - 8. Some of this information actually is present on the Superstore site, but only if you ""zoom in"" on the photo of the front of the product container, and then you can barely make out a statement that it, ""Contains Magnesium, Iron, & Manganese."" I only figured out that I could have done that after I had the product in my hand and saw the writing. Anyway, I just used it to fertilize my palms only two days ago, so it is too soon to tell if it will be effective, but it was easy to apply. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" Hard to find tasty, healthy grain",5,We have enjoyed this grain in very limited quantities for years finding it only in one Italian specialty store where it is quite expensive. This larger quantity is more reasonably priced and it stores well in a glass jar. I prepare it occasionally using the recipe on the back of the original bag but increasing the ground meat to one pound to serve more people. Farro has a wonderful flavor prepared this way or just simmered in chicken broth. It is good served along side a meat or grilled Italian sausages or as an accompaniment to grilled veggies for a vegetarian meal. …,12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Makes steak taste like vinegar.,1,"First of all, Peter Luger's Steakhouse is highly over-rated. The steak is overdone and tastes too fatty, sweet and vinegary. In fact, at the restaurant, they actually tip the plate up and take a big spoonful of the fat that has drained to the bottom, and poor it like sauce over your steak serving. Crazy, in my opinion. Anyway, this retail version of the sauce is just as bad: tons of sugar and mostly vinegar. Marinate your steak in this and all you'll taste is the vinegar. This sauce will ruin a good cut of meat. From good to best, buy shell (aka strip), sirloin, top sirloin, porterhouse, tenderloin (aka filet mignon) and use a non-vinegar-based marinade, like wine and herbs. …",1 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 BLK is GREAT! Why are people such haters-,5,"I am the newest fan of the BLK water. I am uncertain what water the other people are drinking but certainly they have an air for the ridiculously exaggerated. The BLK water is very clean tasting and yes it has faint taste of minerals but nothing like what some of the haters have posted. It does NOT taste like 1. motor oil 2. old stump water, or any other absurd examples posted. Yes the water is completely black but that is about it. I find it chic looking in fact and the fact that it normalizes my pH levels are the plus plus and worth buying factor. The price point is also nothing sticker shocking. It is what you would pay for any other specialty water available on the market. I intend on continuing to buy BLK water and take in the benefits of the dark side.

 The 28th Five Star Review,5,"Rarely have I encountered a product that doesn't have at least ONE person who either thinks it's junk, or gives a (bogus) low review because the delivery guy accidentally dropped the package before leaving the item at the door. As of this moment, 100% of the people reviewing the Greenies PILL POCKETS have given them a five-star rating, and I'm enthusiastically joining the crowd! If you're a dog owner, you've almost certainly had to, at some point, give your dog a pill that he or she was reluctant to take. The usual remedy until now, (as suggested by our vet) was to simply shove the thing down the poor dog's throat, and then rub their neck to help the pill go down. Recently, one of our dogs --a large yellow lab named Chip-- was suffering from untreatable throat cancer, but he still needed to take a number of pills to make his final days a little more comfortable. The vet specifically mentioned AVOIDING the ""shove and rub"" technique as it would be very painful for the dog --who at that point was even reluctant to eat his regular food. Someone mentioned PILL POCKETS. We picked up a bag and lo and behold, they worked like a champ. Though Chip was still not really interested in eating a meal, the *very* meaty smell of the PILL POCKETS was irresistible to him, and he happily gobbled up his meds. Sadly, we lost Chip about a week later, but then our other dog developed a minor skin rash that required he take some antibiotics. Eubie is a Border Collie, and they tend to figure things out before you do --and we were astounded when he wolfed down his medicine and then looked at us as if to ask ""is that all --when do I get another?!"" My technique for using the PILL POCKETS is to stuff the pill(s) inside, pinch off the open end --and then, using my palms, ""roll"" the pocket into a smooth, round ball. With Eubie at least, he loves the smell so much, that he simply swallows it whole. In fact, I discovered another great use for the PILL POCKETS and that is to take a rawhide bone and smear the nooks and crannies with a single pill pocket. Since they're kind of ""doughy"" in texture, they're perfect in this regard --and for a dog that will happily walk around the house with the rawhide bone for days without ever chewing on it, we've found that the ""pill pocket infused"" rawhide is something that he HAS to chew on. (In fact, he was SO focused on this task, that for the first time ever, he actually ignored the fireworks on July 4th.... it was truly amazing!) - Jonathan Sabin …",26 out of 27 users found this review helpful

 Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!,1,"Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned. ~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via Superstore subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that. Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered. Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this! I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can). Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell. How messed up is this? I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm. I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico. And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense. Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish! Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water. But I still miss old Zico. Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH. Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from Superstore, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH. 2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes ""just like"" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'. 3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on Superstore, so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is ""natural"" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo 4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to ""optimize"" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's ""optimized"" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to ""optimize."" (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under ""Todd O'Connor"". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor. Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified Superstore purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess.

To make matters worse Superstore doesn't allow for returns on food items, which is understandable; I don't fault them for that.

 probably not from the Texas Ranch ...,3,"Jim Davis may have been a Texas Rancher but the beef is sourced from ""USA or Uruguay or New Zealand or Australia and further processed in USA"" the flavor is overpowering, which I guess I should have expected from ""hickory"" but it doesn't taste like hickory smoke to me, it tastes like corn syrup (or maybe that's the hydrolyzed soy protein?) it's got enough hydrogenated this-and-that to fuel the Hindenburg. It's also loaded with sodium, which most jerky is, but it really *tastes* salty too. The meat is tender because it was tenderized with papain which is an enzyme in papayas (thanks Wikipedia) there does seem to be a good amount of gristly threads running through it. That doesn't really bother me so much, but it's definitely not ""naturally tender"" meat. This stuff is marginally edible but I wouldn't buy it again.

" A bit large for a small mouth, but definitely enjoyed",3,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:59 Mins </span>What better way to review a dog biscuit than to show how much a dog enjoyed eating it? That was my logic behind this very amateurish but heartfelt video review starring my 1 1/2-year-old Shih Tzu, Missy. The video was very impromptu and, in hindsight, I realize that I didn't do a great job of explaining why I only gave the product 3 stars, so I'm adding some further explanation here. First, I took a star off because I felt that if you're going to make a multi-sized dog biscuit, the small should be small enough for the very small breeds like Yorkies and Chihuahuas. As you can see in the video, this small biscuit is not only 2 inches long and quite thick but VERY hard, so I feel like a very small or more delicate breed may have trouble with even the small biscuit. Second, the ingredient list on the box is almost 3 inches long. Sugar and salt are within the first 10 ingredients and, while there are a lot of vitamins and minerals included, there is also partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, several food colorings and chemicals I can hardly pronounce. I just prefer to feed Missy more natural foods and snacks. Third, the ""feeding instructions"" (which hardly seemed necessary) direct me to give Missy 2 biscuits twice a day. That's 4 large (compared to the small Mother Hubbard bone-shaped treats she usually gets) treats a day, which seemed a bit much, especially much considering my issues with the ingredient list. …",23 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 COMPARISON REVIEW to Nature's Way,5,"When I learned about the many benefits and uses of coconut oil I had to try it, so I ordered 2 jars -one for my pantry for cooking/smoothies etc. and one for my bathroom to use as a body cream. Since I didn't know what brand to choose and didn't have any prior experience with coconut oil I decided to get one jar of the NUTIVA brand and one jar of the NATURE'S WAY brand. Here's my initial opinion of both: With my Nutiva jar there's a sticker indicating the expiration date and package/creation date of the actual oil, whereas with my Nature's Way jar there's nothing like that. When I opened both of them up to try and to just generally check them out I tasted a tiny amount of both and it was very clear that the Nutiva jar's coconut oil tasted much better. I'm not sure exactly why, but to me the Nature's Way coconut oil didn't taste as good, it was kind of toasty in a bad way. It was very easy for me to decide to use the Nutiva brand coconut oil for my cooking and in my smoothies and the Nature's Way coconut oil for my skin. I've since read that this difference in taste could be because the Nutiva brand coconut oil was fresher and the Nature's Way older. Or it could be quality, I'm really not sure. But I am sure that from now on I'm going to just be buying the Nutiva brand Coconut Oil (just ordered 2 more big jars of it). :) To say that the Nature's Way coconut oil was toasty still isn't exactly the right word -toasty sounds like something good... when it's so not, but I really can't think of a better word to describe the difference. I've found a lot of uses for coconut oil and have used it for many things with great results so far. It's hard to believe one little oil can do so much! Weird actually, but everything I've tried it with so far has had positive results. So here's a list of weird, random, but completely amazing things I've found coconut oil to do: -Works better than any make-up remover: seriously, just use a nickle size amount or less on your eyes to get all eye make-up off in a flash. -Helps clear up acne: One night after using it to take off my eye make-up I decided to use it as an all over face make-up remover... then decided my face felt so good I didn't want to use anything else (hint: leave the coconut oil on your face for a minute and then get your water and washcloth really really hot to wipe it all away). I googled to see if this was okay to do and it turns out coconut oil can help get rid of acne! You can use it as a facewash. Strange but true. BUT I also found out that Castor Oil works even better for this (and like coconut oil still moisturizes your face and keeps it from drying out), so I've ordered a small bottle of that to use instead in the future... but still, coconut oil has worked really well for me and apparently others. When you have skin like mine (I'm 25) that occassionally breaks out but still is a little dry sometimes it's hard finding the right balance and exactly the right thing to use -I feel like now I've figured out some great secret to getting it right. -You can use it as a deoderant: This one I read online and decided to try on a day where I wasn't really doing anything or working out. It felt weird -like I was putting some kind of lotion or body creme under my arms instead of my normal Secret deoderant. But guess what? It worked! I have since been trying it on days where I actually do work out and it STILL is working. Craziness! It keeps me dry and smelling good the same as my old deoderant did. AND there's no aluminum zirconium (have no idea how to spell that correctly) which I know is now supposedly bad for you (most deoderants still use it though) because it's connected/correlated with Alzheimers. So... an all natural, organic, one ingredient deoderant that feels like a body creme -doesn't get much better than that! Plus my underarms are looking softer/nicer. :) -You can use it on your scalp and hair: Now I've tried this several times and although I DO like the way it moisturizes my hair, I don't like the way my hair looks after I wash it out... it's just kind of lanky/heavy. Not in an extreme way or anything, but I like my hair to have lots of body. So while I do recommend coconut oil to help heal frazzled hair and stimulate hair growth I don't recommend doing it right before any big event in your life... maybe like a few days before so you get the benefit of the moisturized, healthy hair, without any worries about styling it. This is another one where I've looked it up and found that Castor Oil when massaged in the scalp can stimulate hair growth/fast hair growth even better -so now that I've got that bottle on the way to me from Superstore I'll probably be using that instead, at least on my scalp. -You can use it as a body creme and even a BODY WASH. Yepp. A body WASH. Sounds crazy, but it makes my skin look SO good. Better than it's ever looked actually. Coconut oil has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties (and of course is moisturizing) and will clean your skin while hydrating it. So no harsh chemicals or detergents touch your skin -and if you have sensitive skin like I do, well this stuff might just be your new best friend, must-have, can't live without it ever, stuff! I used to have a minor skin problem on my arms that I absolutely hated. Just general redness, sensitivity, and tiny little red dots on the tops of my arms (that I've had since childhood). Now I absolutely don't -and it's literally all because of coconut oil. Maybe it's because I'm not putting soaps/bodywash on my skin anymore or maybe it's because coconut oil is really that awesome, but it has basically cured my arms and has made the skin all over my body look amazing! I seriously can't believe how good it makes my skin look! The best thing to do is to literally use it like a body wash all over -rinse off and then either just towel dry and go or towel dry and then reapply again if your skin is dry or it's winter or you live in a dry climate. When you reapply you're going to have to have some kind of small towel to wipe off excess with before you put on clothes. Either way it makes your skin look great. :) You can also use it to shave with apparently but I haven't tried that. I'm using it to make my own homemade body scrubs and of course using it as a body creme and loving it! -You can feed it to your dogs (one tablespoon a day) to make their coats shiny. (I've been giving it to both my dogs, although not every single day and they love it. -It can help you lose weight. Apparently it has a lot of really GOOD for you fats that your body doesn't treat like other fats and it actually helps you lose weight (learned this from Dr. Oz). Plus it tastes good when you cook with it and put it in smoothies. Actually I LOVE it in smoothies, it just adds an extra tropical coconut flavor. :-) -You can use it for Oil Pulling. -You can use it as a lip balm. Plus I know there's so much more but that's all I can think of right now! Basically it's really good stuff that I am now believing everyone should have in their home! :-) …",24 out of 25 users found this review helpful
 Definite POP - Not Baked or Fried,5,"Here's the straight talk from a foodie, not a Top Chef food critic, but a foodie: -Name: Pop Chips. They are cooked in a kettle with pressure and heat. Fantastic. Not baked or fried. Made by the company POP CHIPS so it isn't frito lays or mars trying to forcefeed America in disguise. -Packaging and Branding: Colorful and way too heavy-duty bags. This is why they are slightly expensive. Similar to kettle chips packaging. You will have fun opening the bags with a POP. Packaging was great. I've eaten about 6 of the small bags and not one was even slightly damaged. -Taste and Texture: They are about the size of half-dollar coins, kind of puffy like a pork rind or rice cake, and they are not crunchy hard like potato chips but they do crunch. Definitely distinctive and they deserve a place on the market. -Nutrition: 100 Calories! Unfortunately, you know what this means. It's not a big grab by any means. It's about 15-20 chips per .8 oz bag. Which, honestly, is great for portion control. It's probably all we need and popchips knows it. Definitely more filling than other 100 calorie snacks made by, say, SnackWell or the oreos/mini muffins type. -Flavor: The 3 pack comes with Cheddar Potato, Sea Salt and Vinegar, and Barbecue Potato. As an English major I'm inclined to take the ""potato"" off the label. Just as salty and flavorful as normal chips, but not overpowering like some (cheap tortilla chips/some doritos). NATURAL taste. I bought these on sale with a 15-20% discount I believe. I might purchase them again if I won a gift card or something, but I would rather look for these in a store or at a warehouse club and save some cash/trees on the gigantic box they come in. But if you are on the fence and worried about being disappointed, you won't be. This is definitely quality over quantity. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Sour cream powder and Chedder cheese powder,5,"I have made purchases from Berry Farms twice now and both times they have dilivered before the due date, usualy within a day or two. The products are as advertised, and are real good for putting up for desaster storage. The chedder cheese powder is the same thing as Kraft uses in it's macaroni and cheese. The only draw back was there where no mixing directions for the chedder powder, but 1/4 cup of powder, 1/4 cup of butter (1/2 stick), and 1/4 cup milk makes a creamy sauce. Just remember equal ammounts of powder, milk, and butter. They still get 5 stars for prompt delivery. I haven't had a customer service contact yet, so I can't grade them on that. There web sight has a whole bunch of dried goods, and I have also ordered dried bell peppers and tomato powder from them. Their packages are very well sealed and are packed for rough shipments. I recomend this company highly. …",42 out of 46 users found this review helpful

" Great, daily sencha",4,"The title really says it all - if you enjoy brewing tea and drink it daily, this is a great everyday sencha. It has a good, clean flavor you can only get from a full leaf tea like this. Now - a thing or two about Rishi's actual brewing instructions. This is the second Rishi tea I've tried, and like the first, the quality is great and I've been thoroughly enjoying it. If you follow Rishi's brewing instructions, however, you will get an overly potent, undrinkable mess instead of the mild, subtle yet undeniable flavor of a properly brewed green tea. Green tea isn't supposed to taste like the **** you get at Panera or from Lipton - you're not supposed to be assaulted by intense flavor when you drink it. If you follow Rishi's instructions though, that is what will happen and you'll probably end up writing reviews about how it tastes like grass. 1 tablespoon per 8 ounces of water is beyond overkill. Brewing that for 3-4 minutes is even greater overkill. Like most other full leaf greens, 1 TEASPOON per 8 ounces of water brewed for between 1.5 to 2.5 minutes is what the brewing instructions on this tea should be. If I were to put 3 tablespoons of this stuff in my tetsubin and brew it for 4 minutes. . . I don't even want to know what would come out of the spout. So, 1 teaspoon/8 ounces of water for 1.5 - 2.5 minutes (2.5 is even pushing it) and you'll get an amazing green tea that has the subtlety and smoothness that you're supposed to get out of a green like this. If it's bitter or you feel like you're on a green tea roller coaster, you've brewed it wrong. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Don't  Get Too Excited About Ice Cream of the Month Club,1,"I received 3 months of Ice Cream from this Club as a gift. I was very disappointed with the Ice Cream I received and the giver was unhappy after seeing the choices I was sent each month. The first 2 months included a duplication of black walnut, a very bland vanilla frozen yogurt, some type of caramel,that didn't taste at all like caramel(I tried,but couldn't give it away), also 2 peppermint in one month. I emailed them after the 2nd month with my complaint,thinking they might want to take a second look at what was being sent. I did receive an immediate response, with an apology and an offer of an extra month of ice cream. They also told me they spoke with their shipper and was told my 3rd month was really going to be scrumptous. I just received it. May be somewhat better, but there is only one pint with higher butterfat then the average grocery store brand, 2 frozen custards, and 1 ""neopolitan""(how exciting)in a square cardboard carton and from a company not even mentioned in their ad. We have a number of Ice Cream stores in our city and thus far I have only received 1 pint each month that might compare. I felt I should write this review because the person who sent this gift had no reviews to read and had no idea that I might receive duplicates, along with the vanilla custard and neopolitan. …",74 out of 74 users found this review helpful

 incredible product and useful for helping asthma or any other lung problem,5,"I am using this product now. I will discuss both the himalayan salt inhaler and the himalayan salt itself and how I use both. I am asthmatic and have been so since I was 3. I find the salt inhaler helpful but I still use my regular inhaler which is minimal. What I am finding out is that when I drink the himalayan salt twice a day that is helping cut down my asthma. I drink one teaspoon in the morning and the evening. It doesn't taste to bad but I get it down fast. I also use warm water. That approach is making some differences. I use the himalayan salt inhaler along with my other inhaler. The salt inhaler makes my lungs feel good. Asthma is a lower tract problem visiting the lungs or at least if you read about asthma ascarsis it has a full cycle from the lower tract into the lungs. Not a fun problem. My dad and grandfather had asthma and who knows how far back the problem exists. It isn't genetic but a bacterium that is very hard to kill. The drinking of the himalayan salt helps to alkalize the body but it also does some unique tricks of its own for what it is. It is an wonderful mineral supplement of many minerals in addition to the salt. Salt kills anything and is a killer of germs. The process has to be used daily as once asthma and lung problems exist, the fight is on to keep the lid on it. It isn't an easy street problem that can be quickly resolved. I use the himalayan salt drink now to kill what causes asthma and I will continue to use it to keep the problem at bay. It has cut down my allergies tremendously so I'm a big fan of it. The inhaler I really like. It makes my lungs feel good. I can breathe a lot deeper with it I've noticed. I've had mine over about two months now and progress is with both techniques I am talking about. Please note I am not talking about table salt or sea salt of any kind; I am talking about the himalayan salt. It is the only one that has this incredible balancing and healing property to it. I am seeing some wonderful results by drinking it. And believe me asthma has been so miserable for me that drinking it is nothing. If that solves the problem and gives me my life back and my energy, I can handle it. Update on the above: I use the ""sole"" that you make with the himalayan rocks. I have gone to using just one teaspoon of sole in a glass of water in the morning on empty stomach. It is far more effective than doing this teaspoon a day with regular himalayan salt which is what I started out with originally but modified the procedure as time went on and as I learned more about the uses of himalayan salt. I'd not suggest to anyone using a teaspoon of regular salt in a drink of water; it is too much salt for anyone with asthma. It is incredible stuff, but creating sole is with the himalayan rocks and water. You add the rocks to a glass container of water that has a lid and let it sit. You keep adding rocks every 24 hours until the rocks stop dissolving and then the sole water is ready but just do one teaspoon in a glass of water and preferably on empty stomach waiting for one hour to get the best impacts and then you are done for the day until the next time. The sole is highly concentrated at that point. When the water gets down add more water and more rocks and let it sit for the 24 hours before taking anything out. If the rocks dissolve add more rocks. A box of the rocks will last a very long time. Hope that helps clarify the process. Use the himalayan rocks to create sole water and do not drink the himalayan salt by itself--too much salt for anyone in that fashion. The salt inhaler is impressive.

 A major improvement in menopausal symptoms,5,"I tried this product after researching menopausal heart palpitations and internal tremors on www.power-surge . The relief was immediate!

No more weak nails. Monthly acid reflux greatly reduced, sometimes none at all. Greatly reduced frequency of colds, flus and sinusitus. I chose the Calm with Calcium since I am dairy allergic.

 Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor,4,"To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes. NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words ""Medium Extra Bold"" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same.

 Aroma and Taste That Please,5,I have never purchased 30 dollar coffee before so this was kind of splurge for me and I usually drink coffee that comes in 12 ounce bags at about a 5 to 7 dollar range so I wondered how much difference could it really be in quality. I was looking for some good holiday food and I read all the reviews and decided to go ahead and try it out and to my surprise I really enjoyed it and believe me I was expecting quite a bit for 30 dollar coffee. The 1st thing I noticed was the aroma when I 1st broke into the package and it wasn't the normal aroma I was used to when breaking into new coffee for the 1st time. The aroma was so much better and it was so much different and pleasing in smell that I knew it was going to be a great cup of coffee. With anticipation I ground up the beans and made my 1st pot and actually just finished it before this was wrote. I took my time drinking this coffee and I must say I have drank a lot of coffee in my time and thought I wouldn't be able to tell a difference but I found myself looking forward to my next cup. The taste was so fantastic and full of flavor that I really didn't expect it so I was really surprised by that. It was that good instead of with my normal coffee its usually just routine to drink it up even though its good its just not as good as this. If you are looking for some delicious coffee do yourself a favor pick this one up. If you are like me you might splurge every once in a while on food and even if you do it once you will find yourself missing this bag when its gone b/c I know I will. I still have about a whole package remaining and I think I will have to break down again later to get another. Though it is rather expensive I am very happy with this coffee. …,12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical,1,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands. This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi. Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering. The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much. While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal. Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products. Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money). Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer. One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer. Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail *Concentrate Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99 Liters of product per container 12 Flavor/l $0.42 *Carbonator Volume of CO2 130 Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99 CO2 cost per liter $0.23 *Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter Equipment cost $89.00 Equipment life (years) 5 Discount rate (cost of money) 8% Liters per month 10.00 Monthly amortized cost $1.80 Cost of equipment per liter $0.18 *Water Cost with Brita Filtration Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004 Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95 Brita cost per liter $0.0373 Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377 (assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration) ***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2 SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73 Without filtered water: SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65 *****What does CO2 Really Cost???? THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW *Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit) weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2 cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35 CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams *Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation losses: 10% available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85% net accessible CO2 of total: 77% usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams *Output carbonated liters of water: 2,479 cost per liter in USD$: $0.014 *SodaStream Output SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product) Cost per refill: $30.00 cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231 *SodaStream Markup Economics ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534% math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing This is an incredible 1500% markup Pros Saves plastic Allows flexible mixture of flavors Cons Cost of output is not compelling Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit ***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times. At the time of this review, I did NOT have an investment in SodaStream either short or long. In the past, I have both owned the stock and shorted it (bet against it).

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 The best savory seasoning mix ever!!!,5,"I've been having trouble finding this in my local grocery stores, so I ordered a case.

" underrated, give it credit, nothing compares to the original!!",4,"You can't fully appreciate the packaged frozen hot chocolate until you've had the REAL frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity 3 in NYC. While it doesn't come close to the homemade kind you get there, it's a GREAT alternative for when you're really craving some or you miss it or you're just far away and can't have it, etc. It's all about adding your personal touch with the ice, maybe some whipped cream and cocoa shavings like they do at the restaurant. So no, it's not the chocolate dessert to end all chocolate desserts, because that's the ORIGINAL frozne hot chocolate, but this is a delicious, inexpensive, fast, substitute and makes a fabulous gift when paired with a mug or other coffee/sweet goodies. So that's the point, it's not to replace the original, it's just to satisfy some cravings, so if you've never had the original it might not be the best thing in the world to you but after you've had the original you'll find these packets will satisfy many, many cravings taht will follow!

 The best oatmeal available in the U.S.A.,5,"If you dislike oatmeal made from rolled oats, try this product. You will like it. If you like oatmeal made from rolled oats, try this product. You will LOVE it. You must cook this oatmeal for half an hour, so put it on before your shower. You can eat it plain if you make it thin, or you can add cream, half-and-half, whole milk, or 2% milk to thin it a bit. I also like it with a dollop of plain yogurt. Sweeten it with brown sugar or raw sugar, or just add dried fruit (dates and figs are my favorites - dried cherries are good also). Goes well also with a sprinkle of walnut pieces. But here is the best way to eat it -- better than dessert: Sweeten cooked oatmeal slightly with a modest amount of brown sugar, add just enough half-and-half to wet it thoroughly, and then add a healthy serving of fresh blueberries.

 Some GREAT Some HORRIBLE overall i'm HOOKED!!!,5,"Tropical Fruit Tart 5 Stars This bar is very refreshing with a wonderful fruit and citrus flavor and soft chewy texture. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough 2 Stars I'm not a fan of this flavor. The bar would be much better without the chocolate chips that somehow leave a funny aftertaste. Coconut Cream Pie 5 Stars Oh my I do love coconut, and this bar was better then I expected it to be. Wonderful texture and not too chewy. This would be a great replacement for the raspberry coconut zingers I'm addicted to! Cinnamon Roll 3 Stars This one didn't blow me away or disappoint so I am giving it an average review. The bar was a little harder then I would have preferred and the Cinnamon flavor could have been stronger. It should just be called Cinnamon as it does not have any flavors that could hint as being a healthy bar flavored like a cinnamon roll. If you like cinnamon you will probably like this bar but if you are indifferent to cinnamon I would skip this one. Cashew Cookie 3 Stars This one's ok... Good texture, not nearly the amount of cashew flavor I expected for something called ""Cashew Cookie"", and it almost had a stale flavor even though it was eaten well before the best by date. Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip 5 Stars This bar definitely hit my sweet tooth. Great texture, no funny aftertaste like some of the other chocolate Larabar flavors and I would definitely put this on the list of candy bar replacements! Pecan Pie 5 Stars Not overwhelmingly sweet, great pecan pie flavor, perfect soft, slightly chewy texture. Lemon Bar 5 Stars Very nice Lemon flavor and a wonderful chewy texture that reminds you of an actual Lemon Bar! The Lemon lingers in your mouth quite a while. Banana Bread 1 Star This bar was bitter. There's only 3 ingredients: Almonds, Dates, and Unsweetened bananas. Well bananas are naturally sweet so what was so bitter in this bar? Some people might not find this as bad as I did, but I couldn't get past the first bite. Apple Pie 5 Stars Another favorite flavor. It tastes like apple pie with a few nuts. It's just perfect. Ginger Snap 5 Stars Wonderful Ginger snap cookie taste! This is probably the sweetest one I've tried. Good texture, chewy and crunchy, and delicious. Peanut Butter & Jelly 3 Stars This bar had a great texture but only a so-so flavor. I would not purchase a full box of these bars, but I would pick it over some of the others if I had a limited choice. Key Lime Pie 5 Stars This was a nutty bar, which is to be expected, but the subtle hint of lime was delightful. I could stand to use even more lime flavor but the soft chewy texture and lime flavor make this one of my favorites. UPDATE w/Additional Flavors: Blueberry Muffin 5 Stars Oh, I think I've found a new favorite! This bar has a wonderfully rich blueberry flavor without being too sweet and it reminds me of a Blueberry Oatmeal Muffin. Chocalate Coconut Chew 3 Stars As a huge fan of the Coconut Cream I had high hopes for this bar but after eating it the only thing I could say was ""Where's the coconut?!"" I definitley missed the coconut texture and flavor. The chocolate flavor of this bar however was not too sweet, not overpowering, and overall the bar will suffice for a chocolate lovers craving. …",84 out of 85 users found this review helpful

" Sweet, yes. Alpine, not so much.",4,"I've been suffering through an incredibly hot season, more sauna than summertime. I've had enough sweat rolling down my back to charge neighborhood kids three bucks a pop for a Slip 'N' Slide ride, and I'm finally at the end of my sweaty rope. I came here looking for something, anything, to help me beat the summer heat. I've watched those Peppermint Pattie commercials for years. Eating one gives 'the sensation of shushing down a snow-capped mountain,' they say. It's like 'yodeling in the frigid Alpine snow,' they tell me. It feels like 'a giant soothing Sno-Cone down your pants on a hot August afternoon'. So they say, in these commercials. Hogwash. On a particularly sweltering recent afternoon, I put their advertising to the test. I ate forty-six of these little patties -- and I got a 'sensation', all right. Not of skiing or crooning or cooling my undies, though. More like the feeling of three pounds of chocolate crammed down my colon, and a faint minty tinge to all five senses. You ever HEARD peppermint? I can't recommend it. Bottom line: Eat a Pattie if you're looking for a nice sweet treat. But if you're suffering through a summertime heat wave? Drop in a Sno-Cone.

 Convenient item used in torte recipes,5,"Many European tortes and cookies use ground hazelnuts as the major ingredient, replacing flour. Some examples are Christmas star cookies from Germany which are small iced nut cakes that have a baked-on icing (Zimtsterne.) Tortes frequently use hazelnut flour as the main ingredient. Rather than having to rub off the skins and grind your own, you can buy Bob's Red Mill hazelnut meal instead. Keep it in the freezer or fridge as it can go rancid if you don't use it all up. ZIMTSTERNE (Cinnamon Stars) 1 1/2 cups (about 8 ounces) hazelnuts or blanched almonds, finely ground 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest 1/4 cup egg whites (about 2 large) Pinch of salt 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar About 1/2 cup additional confectioners' sugar for rolling 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. 2. Combine the nuts, cinnamon, and zest. Beat the egg whites on low speed until foamy, about 30 seconds. Add the salt, increase the speed to medium-high, and beat until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar and beat until stiff and glossy, 5 to 8 minutes. Reserve one-third of the meringue (about 1/3 cup) and fold the nut mixture into the remaining meringue. 3. Place a large piece of waxed paper on a flat surface and sprinkle with additional confectioners' sugar. Place the nut mixture on the sugar, lightly sprinkle with more confectioners' sugar, top with a second piece of waxed paper, and roll out 1/4 inch thick. Remove the top piece of waxed paper. Using a cookie cutter dipped in water, cut into 2-inch star shapes or use a sharp knife to cut into diamonds. Reroll and cut any scraps. Place on the prepared baking sheet. 4. Bake until set, 10 to 12 minutes. Spread the reserved meringue over the top of the cookies and bake until the tops are lightly colored, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool.

 Absolutely different texture with this than Bob's & other almond flours,5,"When we initially went gluten free I'd bought an SCD cookbook to help me with recipes. However, everything I made had an odd, gritty type texture and I quickly decided I wasn't a fan of things baked with almond flour. Fast forward 5 years later & I end up with a cookbook that uses almond flour extensively, but the author specifically insists that you must use blanched almond meal flour, and especially recommends this Honeyville brand. I was skeptical, but decided to give it a try, since the author insisted the type of almond flour made a difference. We bought the honeyville, made a few things and were amazed! This flour is really great! We've made a lot of different treats with this flour and everyone - even our gluten eating friends and family - have liked what we've made. It is so great to be able to cook with a more nutritious flour (vs. rice, potato starch, and other nutritionally deficient gluten free options) that also tastes great w/o a gritty texture.

 This one supplement has changed my life!!!!!,5,"I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.) None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life. That is, until Natural Calm. This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically! Here are the things this supplement has helped with: Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night. Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations. Mood--- Made me generally happier. Decreased muscle cramping and soreness. Improved gums and teeth. Improved hair loss. Improved digestion and transit time. Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too! But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really. There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Superstore if you want more science of magnesium.) I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement. If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want. Here's wishing you great health! …",37 out of 46 users found this review helpful

 Wow,5,I actually purchased 2 sets of this tea. One for myself and the other box for my friend in Saudia Arabia. I decided to try drinking more tea and less coffee and wasn't sure if the switch was really going to happen. I had already purchased several brands of teas from my local suppermarket but nothing was convincing me to give up the coffee until I got this selection. This ain't your mothers tea!! The first one I tried was the Jasmine Flower Tea. The directions say to let it brew for 1-2 mins but as soon as i poured the hot water you instantly get an aromatic hint of things to come. Just a little milk with this tea and your tastebuds are dancing a jig. Pay close attention to the brewing direction of each variety because some require a longer brewing time. I have replaced 3 cups of coffee with these teas and cut down on my sugar intake(not putting as much sugar in the tea as I did the coffee). There is one problem though...I do not know if my friend in Saudia Arabia is going to get the box I bought for him. …,14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Stabilizes overnight blood sugar,5,"My 9-year-old daughter has Type 1 diabetes and we could not find a bedtime snack that stabilized her overnight blood sugar - until her diabetes educator recommended the Extend Bar. It REALLY does what it claims to do - stops blood sugar from going too low overnight. Now my daughter does not have to eat a glucose tablet in the middle of the night to keep from going too low. Her morning headaches and shakiness are gone! If her bedtime blood sugar is 120, her fasting blood sugar is usually around 100. The bars do not cause a sharp spike in blood sugar, just as advertized. Although they don't taste like real granola bars (not as sweet or moist), all the peanut and chocolate varieties are tasty enough to satisfy a picky 9-year-old. Thank you, Extend Bar! UPDATE 12/2/2010: We tried all varieties of Extend Bar except the Mixed Berry. The ""Delight"" varieties work the best at stabilizing the blood sugar of a Type 1 diabetic, since they contain only 20-21 carbs, no sugar, and 4-6 grams of sugar alcohol: Chocolate Delight Chocolate Peanut Delight Peanut Delight The ""Crunch"" varieties contain 30 carbs, 10 grams sugar (!), and 5 grams of sugar alcohol - and they caused my diabetic daughter's blood sugar to spike overnight. I don't understand why the manufacturer included so much sugar! These are not a good choice for a Type 1 diabetic, although they might work for a mild Type II diabetic who still manufactures insulin: Chocolate Crunch Peanut Butter Crunch No one liked the taste of the Apple Cinnamon variety. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 wonderful!,5,"This is a wonderful product. We have tried several other brands. The health benefits are amazing. We use it for a substitute for shortening in baked goods(pie crust, cookies, etc.) We also prefer it now for frying eggs, potatoes, pancakes, everything, as it is much more stable at higher temps. --A word of caution, if you don't like coconut taste, it will take some getting used to. My oldest daughter(17) falls into this catagory. She is now accepting it more and more. The other 4 kids have had no trouble making the switch. It is interesting that we now eat more healthier fats and fats in total, yet have lost weight. My husband and I have each lost between 10 and 15 lbs. using this product, along with making other healthy changes in our diet. Enjoy! …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 great tasting movie theater poopcorn,5,"good price and very easy to use, just heat up your popper for 3-5 minutes then cut the top open and pour it in, a few minutes later....movie theater quality popcorn for .50 cents a pouch. wish i had a larger popper, but this is a great product if you have a 2.5 oz popper. it is coconut oil (the same kind that movie theaters use, so you get the same taste, fyi they use it because of the high burn temp, so it does not get that burnt taste when cooking)in case you are wondering, since the description does not state the type of oil included and the salt and popcorn are premixed. will buy more. very fast delivery. …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 This Yerba Mate is a Keeper,5,"Other reviewers have mention the fine particles in Guayaki Loose Yerba Mate, but all the Yerba Mate I've tried had some fine particles, and this does not bother me. Yerba Mate is actually made from the leaves and stems of the South American rainforest holly tree, so some dusty particles are bound to end up in the tea. Admittedly, I don't love the taste of Yerba Mate without sweetener and a bit of milk. It does not taste like traditional tea, it has more of a green tea taste, but much earthier. I do not find this tea to be bitter, but then I brew it appropriately: stir the tea in a small amount of cold water, then add 185 degree water. I steep for 5 or more minutes, and if I steep for just 5 minutes, I find I can brew a second cup using the same tea by skipping the cold water and steeping for about 10 minutes. In my opinion, Guayaki Traditional Mate brews up nicely to a full-bodied tea that perks up my brain during afternoon energy slumps, without the upset stomach and ""on edge"" feeling that I get from coffee. In addition to caffeine, Yerba Mate contains antioxidants. I am on my second bag of this Yerba Mate, and I'm very happy with it. This same tea is available in Mate' Tea -Organic - 25 - Bag , so if the fine particles bother you, the bags may be a better choice. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful
" IF you like this, just try tasty east Soy Jerky",1,"First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And, we found out it has granulated garlic, possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to ""spices"". Here it is part of the ""vegetarian spices"" ingredient. The company does not seem very forthcoming. Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available. Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them. This tasty eats soy jerky is the best tasting and what more, no onion or garlic powder in any of their product line. They are rated 5 of 5. This primal strip does not compare. …",0 out of 12 users found this review helpful
