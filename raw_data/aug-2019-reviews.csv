 Dogs love it,5,"My Boxers had HORRIBLE gas while on Science Diet & Royal Canin Boxer Formula. I switched to Wellness CORE & now there is no more gas.

" excellent for coating cookies, pretzels, etc.",5,This coating melts wonderfully in the microwave and forms a perfectly smooth coating over whatever you choose to dip in it. I have lost our local Merckens supplier and was uncertain about ordering online (would it be fresh?) - it was great. Our traditional holiday treats got rave reviews. …,15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Good Tasting and Organic,5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:17 Mins </span>Finding healthy foods that actually taste good is a quest of mine. I love the taste of Kashi's Autumn Wheat cereal. Knowing that it is a natural product and is healthy is fine but he added benefit of tasting good is even better.

 This is a wonderful herb...,5,"While studying herbs I ran across an eyewash recipe that required red raspberry leaf as one of the ingredients. I ended up buying the one pound bag because the pricing was so much better than the smaller quantities. One pound of red raspberry leaf is a lot of herb--at the time, I never thought I'd be able to use it all. I did some research and found that this herb, when drunk as a tea, is good for a plethora uses. Nausea, diarrhea, fevers, flu, hemorrhoids (yes, drinking tea helps hemorrhoids!) diabetes, and virtually any problems involving a woman's reproductive system just to name a few. I serve this tea to all of my guests and recommend it to virtually everyone. The cut and sifted is kind of fuzzy looking, but it works very nicely when brewed. It has a very light and mild flavor that requires little or no sweetener added. I just ordered my second one pound bag. Try it--it's wonderful! …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Decent taste - 5 servings per box,4,"I get tired of labels selectively enhancing numbers to mislead, so these get a star off for that. Big bolded letters it says: ""10 bars"" below, in smaller letters you'll see a small pack has 2 bars. At least they have the decency to call a serving (at the back on small letters: 2 bars). The bars are very small, so it's no surprise that this is the case. On a positive note, the oats are organic, as are a lot of the ingredients. The bars crumble a bit much, so you might lose a piece or two to the floor. Overall, given the quality of the ingredients, and the decent taste, these are a good choice. However, a lot of the time the cost per bar* (10 bars in a box, 2 per pack) is close to a dollar, an honestly, anything over 50 cents is way too much for the size of these, and you would be better off with any of the other products out there that fill you up even more (1 dollar protein bars come to mind - they weigh a lot more than 2 of these). …",35 out of 37 users found this review helpful
 Particular Puss Loves this Food!,5,"So, I have a HUGE cat (not fat, just laaarge) who has never had issues with being choosy about cat food until this past year. She'd kind of pick at a food for a week or so, then just completely stop. Getting her to eat consistantly has been a huge battle, and I've been worried because she's been losing weight which is not good on her gigantic Maine **** self. I don't have much money, but finally did the math and figured out that buying cheaper food and then throwing half of it away wasn't saving me anything...invested in the Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken cat food. It came a few days ago, and I think the year of struggling to find something Beatrix will eat is finally over. She LOVES this food. She's taken to lounging by the bowl and casting pitiful looks of longing at me whenever its not on hand! lol She's happy, so I'm happy. And its no lie that this is human quality food. I haven't actually eaten any of it, cause...well...yuck, but it looks like better quality than the chicken you get at KFC! lol Plus, and this is big because I live in a small apartment...there is almost NO odor to it like most wet cat foods...just smells slightly chickeny. I've also noticed that her tummy seems to be bothering her less if the litter and furball issues are a good indicator. Good food = happy cat. Give it a whirl. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Great treat for a great toy,5,"This flavor and the Barbecue seem to be my dog's favorite, although he does love the liver flavored one as well. Of all the flavored cookie inserts I have tried, there has never been one that he doesn't like. I usually put one flavor in one side of the Everlasting Treat Ball and another flavor in the opposite end. These treats are hard and durable, allowing the dog to scrape off small portions of the cookie at a time. It usually takes my dog a week of constant, daily chewing just to get through one cookie insert. These cookies are the BEST! …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 BEWARE - Superstore LIMITS THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU CAN BUY,1,"The food is GREAT. The cats have gotten completely addicted to it. BUT....what Superstore doesn't bother to mention is that ""quantities are limited"". I have been buying this food for my 3 cats for about 6 months. It comprises roughly half their diet (or 3 cats/day). I just went to re-order and was repeatedly told ""there's a problem"". Long story, and 2 phone calls plus 2 emails later, I was told I have bought the LIFETIME MAXIMUM of this product. I ordered it for almost twice the price via the marketplace, but I am furious with Superstore. NOWHERE on this page do they tell you there's a limit. So I'm here to tell you there is. The food is great, but don't get used to buying it here. …",16 out of 26 users found this review helpful

 Take a walk on the dark side!!,5,"I was surprised to see the ""review"" written by whoever thought this was like swallowing dirt. Don't listen to the haters. I don't think they could ever have even tasted this. This is the real deal and it's actually good. First of all, it doesn't have any kind of grittiness to it. If you closed your eyes and drank it, it would just be water to you. All I can say is that drinking this has given me more energy than I've had in a long time, and it's hard to describe, but I just feel better. Try it, you'll see what I mean. Again, just remember there are plenty of haters out there. I'm a lover NOT a hater!! …",6 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Great Toy for a dog that's tough on toys,5,"Our dog loves her Bad CUZ, but this toy she loves more than any other. She's a VERY tough chewer, and it's survived for quite some time with no damage. One thing - protect your toes with this toy - it's pretty heavy and does get swung around a bit. I wouldn't recommend this toy if you have low tables with knick-knacks, sensitive shins or teeny kids that may get bonked with it. Ours has gotten thrown (by the dog) repeatedly down the stairs onto a hard floor and hasn't broken yet. As far as treats to go into it - remember that the rope is knotted inside the jug, so don't put anything into the jug that's soft or the rope will end up smelling REALLY nasty... …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Chocolate Lover - Chips Ahoy Chewey Gooey Hater,2,"I am a sucker for all things chocolate, and fudge-anything is even more decadently delicious. I jumped at the chance to try these new Chips Ahoy cookies and was extremely disappointed when I didn't like them. The cookie is very similar to those large Grandma's two-pack Fudge Choco-Chip you get from vending machines, but with a fudge-like stuff cocooned in the middle and surrounded by a thin crispy substance (may be sugar, may be white chocolate?). In describing them, they sound delish, but my first-bite impression is a processed and overly-salty flavor that hides the chocolate goodness. At 150 calories every 2 cookies, I'd rather get my choco-fix from a Hershey bar. On the plus side, the new resealable package is great, and keeps you from having to slide the tray out to access a couple of cookies, much less messy! I'm sure there are people that love these, but in my opinion, if you're looking for real old-fashioned fudge flavor, these won't satisfy. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Good price for a good product,5,"I've been canning veggies and fruits from our garden for more years than I care to admit - lol. Whenever possible, I use this low-sugar variety of pectin for jam as our family prefers the taste of less sugar. IMHO, jam tastes much better and has a much nicer fresh-fruit taste using this low-sugar pectin. Example: 4-1/2 cups prepared peaches takes only 3 cups sugar. I've never had a problem with jams not setting up properly using the canning hot-bath method when using this product. I've also used this product to make freezer jams with good results - the set is just a tad softer. The instruction sheet is easy to read even for beginners, includes jam and jelly recipes for several fruits and berries and also has instructions for sugarless jam -- which I have never actually tried. The problem I DO have is finding this pectin in the stores in our area when I need it as it never seems to be available except at the end of the summer, and what's on the shelves after that can be getting near the expiration date for the product. Apparently, this product is considered seasonal; however, store managers apparently don't realize that canning goes on all year long. As an example, today (March 22) I just finished doing three batches of peach jam using peaches we froze last summer. I had to hunt around for the pectin, and what I found was almost near the expiration date and obviously left over from last year. (I'm trying to use up the peaches we had to freeze in 2007 as our trees are already budding for this year's crop). The jam came out great and set properly even using frozen fruit. I've been using this brand of pectin for years and have been very happy with it. Plus, buying it here is so easy, and I don't have to spend time hunting around for it in the stores and being told, ""We won't carry that stuff until the end of the summer."" This is an excellent price as I've seen it as high as 4.75/package in one of our local screw-you grocery stores. There's a lot of satisfaction from making something like jam from scratch and a good feeling when you look in your cupboard and see the jars of home made goodies, plus you know exactly what went in to the jam as you're the one who put it in there. And it's easy to do - the trick is just follow the instructions and measure carefully. The kids really enjoy making the freezer jams as there's no cooking. …",27 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 Stevia Extract,5,"I use stevia extract every day instead of sugar. This product is dependable. By the pound, it is far cheaper than the 1 ounce bottles sold in stores.

For those unfamiliar with the amount to use - use 1/2 teaspoon of extract instead of 1 cup of granulated sugar. …",33 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 Content means less than names,2,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed. Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food. Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm? …",6 out of 49 users found this review helpful
" Thick, rich and delicious!",5,"I have tried many brands of coconut milk and Chaokoh is my hands-down favorite. It's thicker than most brands--almost like whipped cream--and has a uniformly creamy taste and texture. It makes an excellent dip for fruit and adds delicious creaminess to smoothies and soups.

" A good ""backup"" containment system",4,"I set this up around the area where my back gate opens. Sometimes meter readers or other repairmen might leave the gate open, and just in case they did, the above ground fence was extra security. There is a downside to it. It's not very attractive, and depending on how you lay it out, you might have to constantly step over the two wires yourself. I don't think anyone should rely on this as their only way of keeping a pet enclosed, but it does provide a good back up system. I started using mine when my dog was still a puppy. Unlike wireless systems, where the dog must wear a special collar and must be put through a training process, virutally no training is required here. The first time the dog comes in contact with the wire, he or she will get shocked and won't go near it again. My dog never even considers jumping over it, even though he easily could. There are some other drawbacks. The very thin aluminum wires tend to break over time, and if the ground wire breaks off, the light will continue to blink, but the fence will not produce a shock. I recommend you buy a spool of additional aluminum wire because you will need to replace the wire over time. By the way, the ""shock"" is not all that mild! I recommend you find some unsuspecting soul to touch it to see if its working properly. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Cinnamon,5,"Ceylon cinnamon has been recommended over other products from China and Vietnam because the latter contain a chemical that is toxic when consumed in larger amounts.

 Good taste but secretly  DECAF,3,Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning. Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this. Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale. …,13 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Greenies Lite - Not for dogs who had the taste of regular Greenies,1,"My little dog who's rather picky about his treats absolutely loves Greenies REGULAR. As he's getting older, I thought I'd go for the LITE since I'm sure regular Greenies have a lot higher calories. So I bought Greenies LITE (teenie, 96 pack) and he sniffed at the first one and literally pushed it away with his nose and several more attempts have gone unsuccessful and I've been just handing them out to my friends' less-picky dogs. Had to buy a tub of Greenies regular and surely enough, he sniffed at it, did his dance, grabbed it and ran away (well, he was so happy he skipped away) with it. When I smell it, the regular definitely smells better/more appetizing whereas the LITE has the blah~ smell to it. So if your dog already had a taste of regular Greenies, I suggest you stick with the regular. …",13 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Pillpockets are a Lifesaver,5,"My dog Andy requires 3 pills 3 times a day. I started using Pillpockets almost two years ago. We have used the dreaded pill popper for many years. When the popper comes out, Andy beats a hasty retreat. We all hated it, as a lot of times the pills popped out, stayed in the popper, or he gagged on them. Since he had to have pills three times a day, it was a daily ordeal. It all changed when we tried Pill Pockets. He now looks forward to taking his pills. He loves the taste of the Pillpockets, I don't think we can now do without them. He likes them so much, we use them as treats for special occasions. They have made treating Andy a pleasant experience, rather than a ordeal. I wish I would have invented them. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Amazing aroma.,5,"I am so excited to see Superstore offering the Van Houtte k cups. They are by far my favorites. This one is my husbands favorite. I am not big on the fruity flavored coffes, but I love the way this one makes the whole room smell. I was surprised that I like this one. These coffees are a great combination of flavor and a medium bodied coffee. I have tried five of their flavors and all of them taste exactly like what they are supposed to taste like. The 5 I have tried are the raspberry truffle of course and Creme Caramel (tastes like those little square caramels you see at Halloween), Spicy Mayan ( My favorite chocolate and cinnamon mix), pecan praline and creme brulee. I am so happy I no longer have to spend more to stock these coffees. My house is never out of the Raspberry Chocolate truffle and the Spicy Mayan. They have the best and most unique flavors. If you like flavored coffee that is full of flavor and yet has a nice smooth medium bodied coffee taste, then these are a must try. I highly recommend the Van Houtte line of k cups. …",48 out of 49 users found this review helpful

 Works great during my pregnancy,5,"During my pregnancy, I read that raspberry leaf tea can help strengthen the uterus for labor. I started drinking this tea 3 times a day on my 39th week. Before I went into the hospital for a cervadil and induction, I used 2 tea bags and infused it for 30 minutes. I brought some tea bags with me to drink during my stay at the hospital. This is my 2nd pregnancy and this time was more positive and less tramatic for me. I only had to push my son out 3 times before he came out on his own. The contractions were strong enough to push him out without any help from me. I certainly believe this tea helped my labor to be shorter and easier for me. I felt better and stronger for the last 2 weeks of my pregnancy than the whole 9 months. I also like the smell and taste of this tea. I continued to drink this tea for my recovery from giving birth. This tea has become my favorite drink now. I definitely recommend drinking this tea during the last few weeks (starting 34 weeks) of pregnancy. …",33 out of 33 users found this review helpful
 The Good Stuff,5,"FYI, this is Rapadura sugar.

Rapadura is a very historic whole food and completely unprocessed from cane-sugar. It is the best/healthiest form of sugar. Arguably, maybe raw honey is better.

 Very Nice Tahini,5,"I use tahini primarily to make hummus dip for fresh vegetables and pita bread. This is a fresh tahini paste (vs roasted) with a fresh nutty-sesame flavor. This tahini is more liquid than other tahini that I have purchased. You may need to adjust your hummus ingredients to use less liquid to get the consistency you prefer. The current price point of $5.00/lb ($30 for 6 pounds) is OK (previously very reasonably priced from $3.00 to $3.79 per pound.) In addition, 6 pounds is a huge quantity for me despite my liking for hummus. Hummus can be prepared in 5 minutes in a food processor if you start with canned or cooked chick peas. You may need to stir the tahini before using as it tends to separate. Start with 1 clove garlic; chop and then mince in the food processor; add a 15 oz can (drained,reserve liquid) chick peas, 1/3 cup tahini, 1/3 cup olive oil. Mix and process at high speed until smooth; adjust thickness with reserved liquid as needed. Add seasonings such as salt, pepper, cummin or lemon juice to taste. Whether you call it tahini or tahina, this sesame seed paste is also used to make halvah, a candy and debis which is the Middle East version of peanut butter and jelly.

 Gourmet powerful Salt & Vinegar chips!,5,"Kettle brand chips are very crunchy. I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum.

" Good taste, unideal ingredients",3,"First of all, just because you see ""dark chocolate"" and ""blueberries"" doesn't make something healthy. Adding lots of sugar and processed, non-organic milk to raw cacao and/or blueberries quickly reduces their potential health benefits. (Plus corn syrup, etc.) Also, these are NOT all-natural ingredients in the sense of ""from nature,"" as many of these ingredients are highly processed. They do not have any artificial colors or flavors though. (But ""natural flavor"" can mean a lot of things, and these include natural flavor.) Anyway, I was specifically disappointed not to find any ingredient labels online, even at Emily's website (so I've listed them below), but did want to try out the taste of these and the strawberries as well. The strawberries were much better. The blueberries had sort of a funny taste to me; some actually were pretty good, and then you'd get one that really DIDN'T taste good. Of course this is subjective, but I like the strawberries better. Both are pretty good, considering that they're packaged fruit. For those wanting the ingredient list before buying them, here's what the package says: INGREDIENTS: Dark Chocolate (sugar, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, milk fat, soy lecithin added as an emulsifier, and vanilla), Dried Blueberries (blueberries, sugar, natural flavor, citric acid, sunflower oil), Corn Syrup, Tapioca Dextrin, Confectioner's Glaze (refined lac.). …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 A delicious and salubrious treat!,5,"This is the best tasting apple cider vinegar I have ever tried and I've tried quite a few brands but nothing compares to Bragg's cider vinegar. There is an almost 'malted' flavor with hints of sweet/tart apples and no 'bitter' aftertaste. Be sure to shake the bottle up each time before using [it will froth up a bit when you do] because that incorporates all the little sediments of the 'mother' that settle to the bottom. Yes, it's a bit 'spendy' but so worth it! I even add one tablespoon of Bragg's apple cider vinegar to my pitcher lemonade to give it an extra 'zing'. If you want an energy/immune-system super boost, mix one teaspoon raw apple cider vinegar with one tablespoon raw honey, [check out HoneyPacifica] for the best truly raw cold packed honey on earth] 1/2 teaspoon raw coconut oil [Aloha Nu is one of the best], 2 drops of propolis tincture, 1/2 teaspoon of fresh royal jelly and 2 tablespoons of good quality plain yogurt (my personal favorite is Mountain High brand yogurt).

 High Calorie Treat,1,"These are about the size of a small rounded lima bean. They have a shocking 3 calories each, twice as many as a lima bean which has about 1 1/2 calories. No, I am not suggesting that you feed your dog lima beans - just making a comparison based on size. I have a Dobie so it would be insulting to offer him just one of these tiny treats. However, because each of these tiny treats has 3 calories I can't give him very many or he would gain too much weight. If you have a teeny tiny dog that would be satisfied with just one of these teeny tiny treats then go for them. If you have a big dog as I do then you can find a much better treat without all the comparable calories. …",2 out of 13 users found this review helpful

If you make your own soda, this is a good one to try. Orange This is the best one by far of all of the flavors we have tried. This flavor tastes just like the fanta orange soda. We love this one.

These weren't whole and then broke into pieces during the canning process, these were chunks that were packed along with the only large oyster in the can! No way you can fit many jumbo oysters in these tuna-sized cans. It would have been better to put these jumbo oysters in one big square can and arrange them like your typical canned smoked oysters and charge $26/can.

 When you graduate from Sudden Death.,5,"I can't believe it happened, but it did: Sudden Death was no longer a one- or two-drop test of strength. I'm actually putting tablespoons of it in the sixteen-ounce salsa jars now. Two years ago, I'd have run outside and eaten grass to put out the fire. Now? I've gotten my tolerance up. It's time to go a little further. Mega Death is that next gradation of heat, spice, and taste. Really tasty, the single-most important criterion when picking a sauce. It adds distinct flavor and, when properly used, gives you the blend of heat and spice that turns you into an addict. You could literally overindulge with a good sauce, so be careful. I have to revert to my one- or three-drop amounts, and that's not only economical but good sense when dealing with Blair's sauces. If not graduallly tested, you could end up eating grass instead of salsa, and that's not a good way to get fiber. Fred …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Sweet Cooling Burst of Flavor,5,"If you are looking for an all-natural mint without sugar, the xylitol-sweetened mints are pleasantly minty with a sweet burst of flavor. The mints crumble fast, have a cooling sensation and dissolve almost immediately after being crushed. These are not the type of mints you can suck on for any extended period of time and only serve to refresh the mouth immediately. Unlike sugar, Xylitol will not promote tooth decay. This ingredient also helps to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actually produce about 11g of Xylitol a day. Xylitol has been proven to: Reduce Tooth Decay Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria Inhibit the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel Xylitol is believed to be safe, but doses higher than 30g per day can cause stomach discomfort. Since one box of mints is 42 grams, you'd almost have to eat an entire box of mints to experience any problems. The strange ingredient in these mints is ""Hibiscus powder.""

 Can't cook Japanese without it,5,"The basic stock for 1,000s of Japanese recipes, dashi is absolutely essential for anyone wanting to cook authentic Japanese cuisine. As famous chef Shizuo Tsuji once said "" ""many substitutes for dashi are possible, but without dashi, dishes are merely a la japonaise and lack the authentic flavor"". Dashi can be made pretty easily from scratch, boiling some kombu or katsuobushi shavings, but you often make far more than you need for the particular recipe, and it can be a pain to spend all that time boiling. Instant dashi does the trick just fine, and almost no one will notice the substitution. This kind here, ""Hon Dashi"" (meaing ""Real Dashi""), is the cream of the crop of instant substitutes. Made by the company Ajinomoto, Hon Dashi is absolutely brimming with umami, the fifth basic flavor found in Asian cooking. Hon Dashi is made from katsuobushi shavings, so it is a basic fish stock and not suitable for vegans, who would probably want to make their own kombu stock. I use Hon Dashi for almost everything, from basic miso soup, to to using it to boil vegetables and give them a heartier flavor. Along with and sauce , it is one of the most basic ingredients in a Japanese kitchen. …",36 out of 37 users found this review helpful

The deal is great: I'm paying less than 40 cents per cup! This decaf is smooth, mellow, not bitter, and not too dark.

 Great tasting for a health food bar...,4,"I typically get the brownie crunch flavor, but happened to grab one of these white chocolate chip bars by accident. It was a good accident.

I typically buy my bars at whole foods, but they are quite expensive. I may start buying them on Superstore. Only downside is that you can't pick and choose what you'd like in a box on Superstore. The Good: The ingredients seem pretty good as well. Nothing screams to me as a scary lab created chemical. It's got a good amount of fiber, lots of protein and no added sugar or fake sugar (a big pet peeve of mine).

 Give it time,5,"I adopted a dog that was raised by a bunch of frat age boys. You can imagine the diet she had; Burgers, fries, ice-cream, and the cheapest dog foods on the market.

It takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there. It has been almost a year. My dog, Molly, is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free. She gets dry Newman's fed free style, and 4 ounces of Newman's canned every day. Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week. On another note, this diet has made doggy duty much easier.

 Agree with the other reviewers,1,"Don't let the ""Earth's Best"" name fool you .. as stated in multiple reviews here - CHECK THE INGREDIENTS! No wonder so many positive reviews here have the same theme, ""My kids will only eat Earth's Best!"" .. Well that's because they are all SWEETENED, which is one of the worst things you can feed to your child regularly. They WILL develop a sweet tooth QUICKLY, and will start rejecting pure vegetables / other good things because of this. There is no need to inject applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods. That's just shameful, and there is only one reason for it - so the child will eat it and only want this brand. Best advice - if you must buy pre-made food, be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredient(s) and (if needed) water. That's it. Don't buy a vegetable that has ""applesauce"" or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that brand because it's sweetened. Shame on Earth's Best as a company.

 OMG It WORKS!,5,"I have been using this product for almost a week now and my only complaint is that I didn't find pit about it sooner! First, a bit about myself. I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess! I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM. Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep! Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too. Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day! I feel so much lighter, my friends and family always said I was full of **** and I guess they were right! I guess after reading my review you are thinking either she is being paid for this or it really works, well it is definitely the latter! It is working for me and I believe it will work for you too, try it what have you got to lose besides a crappy mood, sleepless night, a lot of **** and cramps? Jeez, I think $23.00 is a pretty fair trade off don't you. One more thing the dosage that I am using is two teaspoons at night and one teaspoon in the morning, both with 3 teaspoons of benefiber mixed in girl still needs her fiber! and BTW it's a store brand).

 Helps to boost male libido,5,"Fenugreek has been so typecast as a way to facilitate lactation that most guys would never dare to think of it for themselves--much less actually try it. The fact that it contains phyto-estrogens just complicates things further if you're concerned about testosterone levels. But sometimes things that look a bit crazy seem to work out well in unexpected ways. I started using fenugreek a year ago, discontinued it because of the testosterone concerns, and recently restarted it to help moderate anxiety symptoms from a choline-related medication I had just started. Since fenugreek's action appears analogous in many ways to oxytocin (a hormone closely related to empathy and the mitigation of fear/anxiety responses), I thought it might help to defuse these reactions. It was at least worth a shot. It does seem to have helped with the anxiety reactions (I combined it with l-glutamine for those who are really interested). What surprised me completely was the very strong boost in libido that I experienced inside of three days. And when I went back and doublechecked the research on fenugreek, I found that a mid-2011 report by Australian researchers showed a 25 percent increase in male libido for those using fenugreek. So objective research says this effect of fenugreek is real. Subjectively, I know that this supplement is way more effective for me than things like saw palmetto that are commonly marketed for libido boosts. And I wasn't even looking for this effect. But it works, and this is one of those side-effects that's a keeper. Beyond this, fenugreek is commonly used around the world by both sexes to help with type 2 diabetes. It appears to help with blood-sugar levels, but I can't say definitively that it works. It's inexpensive enough to be worth trying. My hoped-for long-term use for fenugreek is actually to help with what Buddhists call metta meditation, that is, focusing on lovingkindness. Research by the Center for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin suggests that expert meditators on lovingkindness modulate the functioning of the amygdala, a component of the brain that helps to establish empathic reactions and, once again, is closely associated with oxytocin. My experience so far is that fenugreek does in fact help with empathy. This makes eminent sense. Lactation and mother-child bonding pretty much go hand in hand. If you're interested in the underlying neurophysiology, you can probably do a much better job than me in researching this. If you're just a guy who could use a shot in the arm for lovemaking, then this is a worthwhile supplement even if we can't figure out all the physiology involved. Even if none of the above effects interests you, fenugreek is used for and may help with many other things, such as digestion (see Wikipedia for more information on such uses). I hope some of this proves helpful. …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 I Thought I Hated Coconut Water (Until Zico Chocolate!),5,"Having heard many people express their undying love for coconut water, last year I decided to try some. After about the first sip of the plain unadulterated coconut water I got at the grocery store I knew it and I were not going to be friends. I couldn't even force myself to finish the carton. I could not figure out why everyone was so excited about it and decided it just wasn't for me. Then, one day earlier this month I saw Zico Chocolate in the cold case at a convenience store, sandwiched between juices and sports drinks. I was hesitant to buy it considering my previous experience with coconut water but the lure of chocolate was too much. I am so glad that I decided to go for it! Zico Chocolate could not be more different from plain coconut water. The weird (almost like bad molasses) flavor I found so unappealing in the plain was missing completely from the Zico Chocolate. Because they added some coconut cream it is ever so mildly creamy and the chocolate is nice and rich like semisweet dark chocolate. Just like plain coconut water it has an enticing naturally occurring nutrient content including some calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, vitamin A, and phosphorus. The only nutritional downside is that there is some added sugar, bringing the total sugar for one 14 oz bottle up to 18 grams. However, for me drinking a Zico Chocolate is often a replacement for either a dessert or a sweetened iced tea so I'm not really ingesting any more sugar than I normally would be. If you don't mind the added sugar and/or haven't been pleased with the taste of other coconut water I highly recommend trying Zico Chocolate. This last bit is about buying from Superstore and not about the product itself. This is the first time I've bought this particular product from Superstore and I am very happy with the purchase. It cost me significantly less per bottle to have it shipped by the case from Superstore using subscribe & save than it costs to buy in any store near me ($.75 - $1.00 less per bottle). Although buying it this way made it ineligible for Prime 2-day shipping, the box still arrived here the day after I ordered it and in perfect condition; that is good customer service!!! …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful

I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Superstore (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors. I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there. (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Superstore about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Superstore plus you have to purchase it in bulk). I find that I tend to order blindly from Superstore when I'm actually purchasing from Superstore and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings. This was a bit of a wake-up call. I will give kudos to Superstore for their customer service policies, though.

I only get a pedicure for the pampering every couple of months no longer the necessity and because of the results I apply the coconut oil to my entire body after the bath and I can't believe the difference in my skin's texture. It's unbelievable. The only thing about this one is during the summer months you have to find a cool place in the house to keep this such as underneath the bathroom cabinet or in the linen closet because it will liquify. As a mattef of fact I keep it in my bedroom during showering so the steam from the shower won't won't liquify it because once it liquifies it will eventually reharden at room temperature but the consistency changes which to me also changes the chemical structure in it or something because it just doesn't moisturize the same afterwards.

What a pain in the rear end! Front end, actually. As my cat's gastrointestinal challenges worsened, it took me a while to identify the source of the problem and then a while longer, through trial-and-error, to find a food she could eat and keep down. Finally, I found it: Taste of the Wild Dry Cat Food. I'm pretty sure the key is the omission of cereal/corn fillers in the recipe, but I believe there probably is another reason, too. (I'd tell if I knew.) I'd tried other foods with no fillers before, but still had the same problem, although not quite as pronounced. Maybe it's the venison and/or the salmon, which could be more easily digested by cats than other proteins. I don't know. Whatever the reason, I buy only Taste of the Wild for my cat. We adopted another cat from the local shelter near the end of last year, a one-year old, and switched him from Iams (which the shelter uses) to Taste of the Wild. All good; almost six months later, he's flourishing. No, I'm not an employee, vendor, distributor, or any other person or entity related directly or indirectly to the manufacturer. The stuff is just really good. …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 not straightforward about allergen information,1,"My daughter is extremely sensitive to gluten so many products that promote themselves as gluten free prove to be otherwise when my daughter has a gluten reaction. For the sake of keeping my daughter healthy I contact companies asking them if they test for gluten and if gluten is processed in the same facility. If it is then it is almost certainly contaminated. Most companies give me a detailed and open answer so that I can make the best decision for my daughter. They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not. They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision. Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer. They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing. They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels. They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so. So Larabar is attempting to deceive me. They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars. Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful. I was so turned off by Larabar's response that I want nothing to do with them. It was obvious they could care less about my daughter's health. Ultimately, they put their profits above children's health. …",10 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 Vino Italiano kits,5,"For the price and items included these are great kits. I went by several other reviews and made 5 gallons rather than 6, definitely makes a difference. Instead of using the yeast supplied I get quality yeast that vitners use. For this wine and the Cab I used BM4X4, it does wonders to the wine. Great body and mouth feel. After the secondary fermentation I added Hungarian med+ toasted oak cubes and allowed it to bulk age for three months prior to bottling. Bulk aging brings out more complexity in the wine and because of the size of the carboy the wine is less effected by temperature variations. After three months in the bottle in a wine fridge at 58 deg the wine is just as good as a $50 Barolo purchased at a wine store. Yeast is everything to the wine, get advice from a winery that produces the types of wine you really enjoy, most will be glad to tell you. BM4X4 only comes in 500 gram packaging so I have enough to last quite a while (I use about 1tsp per batch - follow the manufactures instructions to prep the yeast before adding to the must) . Sealed and stored in the fridge you will get your money's worth for the quality of wine it produces. When adding oak, get cubes instead of chips, the chips will be spent in a week, 2.5 to 3oz of cubes in a 5 gallon batch for three months is almost the same as 1 year in a barrel, so taste after the first two weeks for flavor up to the taste of oak you desire. It's better to add more later to taste than add too much and over power your wine. I've made several batches of wine and the Barolo is by far the best one to date. The Italian Red came out very pleasant, but again, the yeast makes all the difference. To date I've made six of these kits and will continue to do so. I've made kits from other companies, but the price didn't show in quality when a great yeast and the type of oak for the flavor desired is used. Morewine website has some great reading on oak varieties and effect on wine. Do a little research and anyone can produce very nice wines. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee,5,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday. I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now). However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee. I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"". Enter Donut Blend. I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family. When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it. Here is my take on it: It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity. Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii. It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee. If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup. Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one. Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.

 Seltzer with Lemon Marketed as High Quality Tonic,1,"I'm absolutely in love with my Tanqueray & Tonics; I drink them at least once a week and was looking for a way to improve what seemed insurmountable with a better tonic water. Usually, I stick with Seagrams (and have even gone with Diet a few times). I purchased this case of Q Tonic thinking it would mix the low-calorie of diet tonic with the rich taste of non-diet tonic. I was wrong! After having numerous picky drinkers give Q tonic a taste, we've all come to the same conclusion: it tastes eerily similar to seltzer water. Have you ever been to a bar and ordered something with tonic only to find that they were out and substituted seltzer instead--it's no fun! Well, picture spending $45 dollars on a case of fancily bottled seltzer and mixing that with your favorite drink! So, in conclusion: if you like the fancy bottles and the lower calorie seltzer water tasting tonic, this is the tonic you want.

 Saturated Fat Nightmare,1,"With all the reviews of this popcorn, I'm surprised not to find any mention of the horrible saturated fat content of this. Anyone with any concern about their cholesterol or saturated fat content really needs to look closely at the nutritional guide. I couldn't find it listed on their website so I asked them to email me a copy. Wow, 40g of saturated fats in one of these packets and they call it 5 servings. Daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie/day person is 16. You would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. The biggest concern I have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. The problem is entirely with the oil they are using. Coconut oil. They list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. Most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. I asked Great Northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. They refused. It tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. In some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. I love popcorn. But health is a concern to me. If you are concerned about saturated fats, look at the nutritional guide for these packets. …",4 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" Great price, great coffee!",5,"I bought this item to take apart and create several gifts with it. In other words, with these 30 packets, I was able to create 5 great gift baskets by just adding a couple of coffee mugs in each one. To buy this to use as a single gift is fine as well, but, you will need to figure out a different way to present it. It comes in a sturdy, sectioned cardboard box (in the photo, it looks to be wooden, but it is not), and so the packaging isn't particularly pleasing to the eye. However, the coffee packs themselves are lively and colorful, and they will make a fantastic gift in another type of a container (i.e. basket or something). I decided to keep 5 packs of the coffee for my own use, and I have to say that the 2 that I've tried thusfar were outstanding! Very smooth, with strong, distinctive flavors. Specifically, I tried the Amaretto and Mocha so far, and both were great. This sampler pack is pretty inexpensive, and it's a great way to give a little something to your coworkers at Christmas.

 Another marvel,5,"My first taste of Taza chocolate was their candy - don't laugh, it works! That impessed me so much that I had to try more in their product line. This vanilla-infused offering meets the high standard set by my initial Taza experience. With only three ingredients (organic sugar, cacao bean, and vanilla), the flavors come through crisply and well-defined. They open up in layers, starting with the bittersweet darkness of the chocolate itself. The vanilla note follows, pronounced without overwhelming. The finish includes a fruity tartness, possibly with traces of citrus. That last flavor helps remind that chocolate is a flavor from nature, and that natural flavors have complexities that reveal themselves differently to different parts of the palate. It didn't surprise me this time: the sandy texture of the stone-ground cacao bean. Don't looks for Godiva silkiness here - the texture calls to mind the ancient Aztec preparation of this wonderful flavor. If you can learn to like that, Taza could easily become your favorite chocolate. -- wiredweird …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

It's got a nice texture, not too brothy or too thick. It's got a nice mouth feel. Not too acidic, as some veggie soups can be, overusing tomato. This is a great addition to a low-calorie/weight watching diet. The whole box is only 150 cals. There's lentils and brown rice in there, too, so you get some protein. (And it adds to the nice texture). Low calorie, with fiber and vegan-friendly, pleasant flavor.

Well, as is my nature, I did needless amounts of research on the effectiveness of powdered wheat grass, and found several articles with very mixed answers, so I decided to give it a shot and decide for myself. My first impression was that this stuff was disgusting. While fresh wheat grass bought at a health store smells like a freshly cut golf course, this stuff smells like a barn. I held my breath and mixed the recommended amount of the dark green powder with a glass of ice water and chugged. I couldn't get 1/4 way through with the mixture before I gagged and decided I would never drink the stuff with water again. The label recommends drinking it with a juice, particularly orange juice, so that's what I did the second time around. If you mix it with a strong enough flavored juice, it is actually quite enjoyable. The nasty taste is barely detectable, and all you are left to put up with is the smell. Currently my favorite juices to mix it with are stronger flavored juices mixed with multiple types of fruits - anything with grapefruit juice works great. On to the effects. When I down a shot of fresh wheat grass, I get a small boost of energy - but most importantly I maintain a healthy up-beat feeling throughout the day. The result is more of a lack of fatigue than an elevation in energy. With this powdered wheat grass, I get the same effect, simply on a lesser scale. The initial boost of energy is barely noticeable, but I am able to maintain that same ""healthy feeling"" that I get with the fresh wheat grass. And the nutritional value is all there: both the vitamins and chlorophyll (see table below). The final test, which I plan on conducting: The Hangover Test. A shot of wheat grass will get me out of that half-asleep feeling I get after a night of heavy South Florida binge drinking, so it is only natural that I test the effects of the powdered wheat grass on a hangover. While I am tempted to drink solely for the sake of this review, for now I must wait - I will update with results asap. Nutritional comparison of generic wheat grass powder to fresh wheat grass.

Still deserves 5 stars. …",88 out of 91 users found this review helpful
 Career saver!,4,"I can't explain how much of a difference this product has made in my life. It is hard enough being a Carny in a traveling circus, but imagine how hard it is being a magician with all these new laws being passed to protect live animals. I thought my career was over until I found this. There are so many laws and regulations in each and every state about using live animals for performances that I had to give up my number act, pulling a rabbit out of my hat. UNTIL NOW! I was able to skirt the false advertisment laws by telling everyone I would be pulling a ""real"" rabbit out of my hat. How's that for creative marketing? Sure, they aren't exactly pleased with my act, but what can they do? I told the truth. I'm only in town long enough to get put on the sex offender registry and learn the bathroom stall ""knock codes"" at the local boys club (if you know what I mean). I would have given it 5 stars, but you have to find a way to keep it chilled or it will start to stink. I don't want to scare off the bearded lady you know. …",29 out of 36 users found this review helpful
 Have a seat... because your mind is about to be BLOWN.,5,"I believe it was the esteemed Neil Patrick Harris who, eons ago, said ""Suit up. It's going to be legendary!"" Mr. Harris would never admit it because he never was one for product endorsements, but I'mma blow the lid off this mystery: He was talking about Coffee-mate's Pumpkin Spice Creamer. Upon hearing that this product existed, I promptly began to hyperventilate and had to be awakened by smelling salts. To say that I love anything pumpkin-flavored would be the biggest understatement since... well... I'm looking for historical precedents here, but I'm really not well-versed in the history of understatements. Anyway, I digress; after being awakened, I promptly drove 107 mph the entire way to the store, causing 7 minor traffic accidents, a stampede of antelope, and at least one unplanned pregnancy. I then sprinted to the Dairy section, mind racked with anticipation and apprehension; would they truly have the Holy Grail of coffee creamers, or would I be left utterly disappointed, like that time when I was seven and my parents ate my entire birthday cake right in front of me, laughing the whole time? And then, I saw it: A fully-stocked shelf of Coffee-mate Pumpkin Spice Creamer. I gasped in delight as I grabbed the nearest bottle off of the shelf, passionately ripped off the lid, clawed desperately at that Godforsaken plastic freshness seal, and chugged the entire bottle on the spot. For what seemed like hours, I collapsed on the floor of the supermarket, chest heaving in pure ecstasy as a subtle afterglow began to emanate from every pore of my skin. Long story short, I'm serving a lengthy prison sentence now for not only my incredibly lewd public display (I don't even REMEMBER taking my pants off), but also my inadvertent destruction of the entire Dairy section. And you know something? I'd do it ALL again. And I will, as soon as I'm out. Be prepared. Also, it's now January, so if you want in on this, RUN to your nearest grocery store and get some, or else you will live in regret until October when it comes out again. Cheers! …",27 out of 29 users found this review helpful
