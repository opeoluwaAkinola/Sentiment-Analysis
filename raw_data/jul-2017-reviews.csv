" completely bland, flavorles, tasteless ""jumbo"" lump crab",1,"For the first time, I'm going to look into returning a purchase to Superstore, sorry. I expected jumbo lump crab, but got some totally wet, soggy, tasteless lumps of white pieces of crab. I've had jumbo lump crab in the past, this is not it. For some reason, it's packed in some sort of liquid and then the can is lined with some sort of paper substance. I've used this companies products for many years, this is not up to their usual standards. The pieces are quit small, like they came from a small crabs and they are saturated with liquid. Lump crab that I have bought previously in the pouch has almost no liquid run off and consequently the crab is tasty and solid. Krab tastes better to me. I thought it was a good deal as the price per pound computed to be about half what I usually pay, but a bad bargain to say the least. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Because our kids aren't obese enough,1,"Thank you Gerber, for helping us get our kids off to the right start! Why should we parents take the time to prepare healthy snacks for our children and teach them to like REAL food, when you have Baby Cheetos in a can for them to enjoy? One-third of America's children being overweight or obese simply isn't enough -- we need to strive for more. America's kids need to learn to fill up on empty calories and eat for boredom, not hunger, starting at a year old or younger! And thank goodness this product ""tastes good"" -- because that's all that matters, right? …",3 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Loving it!,5,"I've used the refrigerated Int. Delight Irish Creme before, and it's easily my favorite flavor. However, being a college student with a rather small fridge, it's hard to make sure I have it when I need it. It's also rather hard to go and pay $6 for a bottle that could easily expire if my power goes out in the dorm (which is often). I paid $.06 per individual package- far less than I would have otherwise. I went and bought this last week for the start of term, and I must say, having the single serve packages is much more convenient than a large bulky bottle. I can put the extras away in my closet, and keep a few out on my desk without worrying about keeping them cold. The taste is exactly the same as what you would find in the cold section of your supermarket. I highly recommend getting this if you love your creamer as much as I do, and are either on a budget or need the extra space in your fridge. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Greenies - Catnip for dogs,5,"I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 I'm Converted!,5,"This long grain,American Basmati brown rice is sensational. I have switched from my old brand of rice to this one for nutritional reasons being that brown rice contains nutrients like zinc, magnesium and manganese. It has more fiber It's so flavorful, I added some garlic,onion and celery as I boiled it. The aroma was captivating, without exageration. It tasted delicious and I just wish I had more time to cook.

 Great flavor!,3,"This is a tricky product to review. On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter). If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars. However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity. It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons. however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter. So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days). But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor. So I would repurchase this but only for adding to shakes. …",180 out of 188 users found this review helpful

I finally found them here... at a decent price and just this kind instead of a mixed box(which I am sure would be fine, but I want these and only these!)

 Tastes great AND it's good for you!,5,"I'm sitting here this morning drinking a cool and refreshing Guayaki Yerba Mate and it reminded me that I have not yet done a review on my most favorite drink. Guayaki mate comes in many forms; dry loose-leaf tea, tea bags for steeping, and sweetened, flavored iced tea. I was first introduced to the joys of mate over a year ago by my tea-savvy sister-in-law. She was so devoted that should could not help but tell everyone she knew about the awesome powers of mate. Yerba Mate is made from a holly tree that grows in the South American Rainforest and the native people have been drinking it for centuries. In fact the natives call it the ""drink of the gods."" Mate contains a cousin of caffeine that many have dubbed ""mateine"" which wakes you mentally without all the negative side effects that caffeine has. It doesn't give you the jitters, or an upset stomach, or the sweats. It just gives your brain a little energy boost slowly but very effectively. Mate also contains many antioxidants, even more than green tea! The plain hot tea tastes very similar to plain green tea and is great on a chilly morning. They have recently started selling flavored versions of the hot tea (at least at the store near me) but I have not had a chance to try them. I know one of them is mint flavored and I would bet that it's tasty. The sweetened and flavored ice teas are beyond delicious. They come in Revel Berry, Lemon, and Mint flavors and I have tried all three. I'm not a big fan of the mint flavor, but my husband thinks it's the best of them all. My personal favorite is the Revel Berry flavor. Best of all, Guayaki is Certified Organic, Fair Trade, Kosher, and Non GMO. Guayaki is committed to helping the farmers earn a decent living as well as restore the Rainforest. According to the Guayaki can, ""Guayaki's mission is to steward and restore 200,000 acres of South American Atlantic Rainforest and create over 1,000 living wage jobs by 2020"". So, we can rest assured that the delicious beverage we are enjoying is going to actually HELP the Rainforest instead of ruin it. So drink up! …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Put Pasta Back in Your Diet,5,"Okay, I first came across the ""Fiber Gourmet"" brand from a vague Google search for ""low calorie pasta"". I'd previously bought into the shirataki noodle craze and while I admit--calorically speaking--shirataki have EVERYTHING else on the planet beat hands down, I quickly tired of the stuff mainly because I knew I would have to chew the heck out of it before swallowing, lest It Come Out Looking the Same Way It Went In ('nuff said there) and for the cost of each bag (the store brand I found in the tofu aisle was roughly $2.50 ea and the Miracle Noodle brand from online is essentially the same for 8-9 oz bag) my diet was getting pretty expensive eating 2bags a day 4 days a week. I ate shirataki by the bag, after all... So when I happened across the Fiber Gourmet website, I simply bookmarked it and went along my way. Finally, after a couple more weeks of laboriously chewing shirataki, I decided to give it a whirl and ordered from the official website. I have to admit, the first time I tried the Light Spaghetti pasta I wasn't exactly bowled over and that was because I was actually mixing the Fiber Gourmet noodles with another, lower sodium (but still 210cal/srvg) noodle brand and honestly wasn't seeing much of a difference--on the scale or satiety-wise. However, in the past couple weeks I went back to my case of 6 boxes and tried them again, this time wondering why in the world I didn't like them first time! I stopped mixing them with the other noodle and most times have either exactly the 56g serving size or 84g (1.5 srvg) and mix it with veggies, spices and low-sodium/calorie glazes (Captain Rodney's Sweet & Spicy Pepper Glaze being my fav). For a treat I'll throw in a couple ounces of Morning Star Farms fake chik'n strips. The best part about the Light Spaghetti is how absolutely filling they are. I've taken to having the above-described dish for lunch and honestly I don't feel hungry again until several hours later. 18g of fiber is just ridiculous (per serving) but I'm so glad it's there because you really don't need much of the noodles to get satisfied. That's one thing these have over the shirataki. Another is the whole ""chewing element""; I found I don't have to count 32 chews (literally; I actually did this w/ the shirataki) before swallowing. Fiber Gourmet also cooks dang close to legit pasta. I found that really leaving them on the stove boiling for a while (over 20mins) is best and you can tell from sight when they're ready. I haven't managed to overcook this pasta yet. But above all the pros, I have to say that the fact they fill you up is the best. I'm on a low calorie diet so having that extra 70 cals/serving these spare you really helps. My faux-lo mein:) meal described above is around 250-395 cals depending on whether I add any meat to the pasta. Since I don't need an afternoon snack on the days I eat Fiber Gourmet for lunch, I can save another 100-150 there for dinner. I wouldn't recommend having these more than once a day or having more than twice the serving size on account of how much fiber is in a serving but so far I've had no intestinal issues whatsoever (TMI?). Oh! And even though I bought my first case from the Fiber Gourmet website I'd highly recommend buying them here from Superstore--when I saw the case for $16.92 WITH PRIME S/H I was sold and ordered immediately so I won't have to go even a day w/o these. I paid about $20 for the case from FG's site and then about $7-10s/h on top of that so the deal is DEFINITELY here. Since I've incorporated the FG pasta into my diet I've dropped almost 3lbs in 10 days whereas shirataki 4 days a week had me at a statistical standstill. I highly recommend FG's pasta if you want to taste noodles almost exactly like the real thing and can't stand the thought of life w/o a past dish like I can't:) …",24 out of 24 users found this review helpful

" human quality ingredients, unique manufacturing process-- my cat loves it!",5,"Blue Buffalo Spa Select is great! Top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- in addition to the indoor cat formula there's a chicken version and a fish version. This food meets a very high standard. No yucky meat ""by-products"", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, plus a host of wholesome and varied ingredients and probiotics. On top of that, this is an incredibly palatable food. My cat LOVES it. In fact, she scarfs it right down, when she typically has just grazed on a piece or two at a time of other premium foods. I have to be careful to use a measuring cup and not overfeed her, 'cause she will seek me out and meow for more! Blue Buffalo uses a unique process to manufacture ""lifebits"" which are added to the food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into cat or dog food. I came across this cat food at the local Tractor Supply. I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Here's a summary of the nutritional information: -Recommended daily feeding chart-- amount varies based on age, activity level, breed, and environement, but in general a 5-9 pound cat will eat 1/4-1/2 cup, while a 10-14 pound cat will eat 1/2-1 cup. -One cup contains 478 calories -Major ingredients: Deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground barley, fish meal, oatmeal, whole ground brown rice, whole potatoes, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, dried egg, dried cellulose, whole sweet potatoes, whole carrots, cranberries, blueberries, flaxseed (natural soource of Omega 6 fatty acids), barley grass, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, kelp meal, taurine, l-carnitine, l-lysine, ycca schidigera, green tea extract, turmeric, salmon oil (natural source of Omega 3 fatty acids), black malted barley, dried chicory root, fructooligosaccarides, oil of rosemary, the expected vitamins and minerals, and several probiotics (lactobacillus acidolphilus, bacillus subtilis, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bifidobacgterium longum, enterococcus faecium). I hope this helps you evaluate whether or not this food is a good match for your feline friend. My cat and I have been really happy with it. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
" Like crack, but runny and brown.",5,"This stuff is on every restaurant table in Costa Rica. Many an unsuspecting tourist has been strung out on this liquid crack brownsauce. It is good on eggs, meat, fish, veggies, table legs, mystery meat, breakfast, brunch, lunch, drunch, dinner, supper, snacks, old leather shoes, pieces of table cloth, tofu, sushi, Thanksgiving turkey, Christmas turkey, random middle of April Turkey, tacos, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, bacon cheeseburgers, and of course french fries. In summary, it is good on anything you can shove into your mouth. If you accidentally drip some on your hand, you may end up nibbling off a few fingers! of course there's a lot of sodium in it, but that just means you can leave off the extra salt in the recipes.

 Not Really K-Cups But They Do Fit in Your Keurig,3,"Don't be alarmed when you receive these and they don't look like a standard K-cup. These are not K-cups, but dowill fit in your machine. I thought I had ordered the wrong product at first. These simply have a plastic ring at the top so that they'll fit in your K-cup holder and the rest of it is like a standard coffee filter. I've only tried Fog Chaser (ordered all 3 flavors) and was surprised that I liked the coffee. However, because it's using a filter rather than the K-cup technology, it does leave a sediment in the bottom of your cup. I find this also happens when using the My K-Cup filter with whatever brand of coffee I use. You will need to store the ""k-cups"" in a ziploc to keep them fresh. The 36-count come packaged in 3 plastic bags of 12 each. This is nice so that you only have to open up one 12 pack at a time so the others can stay fresh. I'm mostly neutral, but lean more toward ""would buy again"". …",86 out of 95 users found this review helpful
 Very Good Popcorn,5,"This yellow popcorn comes in a useful airtight plastic canister that will keep your popcorn fresh and can be re-used to store grains, beans, tea, etc. With a four-pound supply, one canister should last a while. This popcorn pops very well on the stove. Here's how I do it: I recommend using a 5-quart stockpot/chili pot/dutch oven to make popcorn on the stove. You don't necessarily need high walls on the pot, but you do need some interior volume to accommodate the expansion of the popped kernels. 1) Pour 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil into the pot. 2) Put three corn kernels into the oil and cover the pot. 3) Turn the heat on to medium-high. The interesting thing about making popcorn on the stove is that a medium-high heat works better than a low heat, because the kernels pop more quickly and thus have less time to burn. 4) Listen carefully to the pot -- the three kernels should pop within a couple of minutes. When the kernels have popped, remove them from the pot. Now sprinkle or grind some sea salt into the oil, and any other spices you may want to use (curry powder, turmeric, cumin, pepper, etc.) Spread the salt and/or spices around with a wooden spoon to incorporate them into the oil. 5) Pour 1/2 a cup or 3/4 of a cup of popcorn kernels into the pot. Use a spoon to move the kernels around and coat them thoroughly with oil. Cover the pot. 6) Now wait for the kernels to pop. Make sure the lid on the pot is tightly sealed. Every 30 seconds or so, grab the pot handles using oven mitts or potholders and lift the pot slightly off the flame, shaking the pot around in a vigorous circular motion and side-to-side. Put the pot back down on the flame. Shaking the pot helps to keep the kernels from burning and also ensures the kernels are receiving even heat distribution. 7) The kernels should begin to pop, slowly at first, then building up to a rapid crescendo. Continue shaking the pot every half-minute or so. When the kernel popping starts to die down, turn off the heat. 8) Remove the pot cover, and stand back for a minute. Sometimes, some kernels will still be popping, so just keep some distance. 9) Pour the popcorn into a large bowl and enjoy! Put any leftover popcorn into a zip-lock bag and seal it. It will last a few days. …",22 out of 26 users found this review helpful

Add 1/2 a bag of frozen peas to the pasta when cooking...and then once it's completed...refrigerate it overnight, and microwave the next day. That is the secret.

 A must-have for dynamite sauce,5,"I purchase this mayonnaise regularly, usually more than one bottle at a time. I use it for making Japanese dynamite sauce, although it is very nice in sandwiches as well. This mayonnaise has a flat taste to it, and is not at all sweetened like American-style mayonnaise. The product is tops but the packaging is a little odd. The mayonnaise itself comes in a squeeze bottle, and the squeeze bottle is packaged in the red-printed cellophane bag you see in the picture. Well, when you remove the bottle from the cellophane bag, you are left with a plain bottle, with no markings on it whatsoever. You will know what is in the squeeze bottle, but others won't, so you just need to communicate that to anybody that has access to your refrigerator. A nice little bonus is that the cap on the squeeze bottle has a rosette tip, so you can make fancy little mayonnaise decorations straight out of the bottle if the occasion arises. …",42 out of 43 users found this review helpful

 Doesn't get much better,5,"Long time Oatmeal eater here. I usually bought McCann's in the store, but it can get pretty pricey. Superstore is a great deal, and you get free shipping. FYI, medium- to long-term is it unhealthy to consume steel-cut oatmeal UNLESS you soak it in warm water with something acidic between 12 to 24 hours, preferably some fermented milk product like yogurt, kefir, buttermilk, etc. Reason being is that oatmeal contains in its hull enzyme inhibitors that have a chelating effect on your body, i.e., they remove metal from your body. While short-term this may be beneficial (meat eaters stockpile extra iron, copper, etc. over time), medium-term this could lead to deficiencies in essential metals. Soaking the oatmeal at least overnight neutralizes the enzyme inhibitors. Additionally, it allows you to cook up the oatmeal in about five minutes, versus over 30 minutes when left unsoaked. This recipe follows the recipe in Nourishing Traditions, but basically soak one part oatmeal with one part lukewarm water. Add a little bit of yogurt to create the acidic environment: I use one TBSP per 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1/2 cup of warm water. Oatmeal should be eaten with some fat (many of the vitamins are fat soluble), so I add butter or cream. I also add shredded flax and coconut, increasing the healthiness of my breakfast. I then top it off with plenty of raw honey (also from Superstore), which sweetens my porridge and thus makes me look forward to breakfast in the morning.

I can't wait to get back home so I can stop eating crappy black beans from the store.- Organic farming practices are way better for the environment and the watershed, therefore even though these and all canned black beans taste, look and feel exactly the same either way, you know you aren't contributing to the huge dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico by supporting all the farms that spray chemicals all over their fields.

P.S.- Artisana is an environmentally-friendly company, and uses only glass jars to store their oils and butters.

 My Dog Thinks This Is Her Treat For the Day!,5,"When my vet told me my little Yorkie had stage IV luxating patellas (knees blown out), I was devastated. The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the ""chicken flavor"" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog. On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online. They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition. This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos. As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended ""Golden Aloe"" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well. She's my best friend, I'm on disability and won't be able to afford the surgery if and when it's required so I am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only 3 years old. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Manuka magick!,5,"This is an excellent quality Manuka Honey product. There is a bit of confusion over the UMF, MGO and OMA rating thing. UMF is the original and trademarked. MGO is a newer rating system that does not directly correlate to UMF but is accurate nonetheless. OMA is Wedderspoon's own rating system for determining activity within the raw honey. From my reading it appears to be pretty equitable to UMF. This honey is also USDA Organic certified (although that doesn't mean as much these days) to ensure that there are no additive ingredients to the product. As for usage, I have two jars of this honey. I used the first on my wife's wounds following MOHS surgery for removal of skin cancer. The results were amazing and the surgeon and plastic surgeon both asked what we were using to allow the wounds to heal up so quickly with minimal scarring. There was also a staph infection as a result of the surgery that the honey took care of as well. It takes a bit of diligence to ensure daily dressing changes with fresh honey, but the results pay off. I ended up pre-soaking gauze with the honey and sandwiching between two layers of plastic wrap to create more manageable ""bandages"". These were used by my wife when she traveled in addition to direct application to the cleaned wound bed. Basic process: Clean wound with Hydrogen Peroxide, follow with colloidal silver in nebulizer, then drizzle honey into wound and cover wound with pre-soaked gauze pad. The last bit is to cover the pre-soaked pad with a waterproof dressing like a Telfa-style pad to reduce oozing onto clothing/bedding. Care must be taken in finding adhesives that do not irritate the skin too much with the frequent dressing changes. There are also larger waterproof wound dressings with silver-impregnated that might be a good combination. Main idea is to minimize air-space and keep honey in constant contact with wound bed. If this all sounds new, do some research on honey for wound care at the University of Waikato in New Zealand courtesy of Dr. Peter Molan. Note, this honey is not ""sterilized"" via gamma radiation (which is not supposed to reduce activity in the honey like pasteurization) but is still highly effective. Honey is resistant to most any spoilage due to its activity and the sterilization process is just an extra step some honey manufacturer's take (Comvita or Summerglow) to be able to sell their products as medical devices in the US. It will allow the honey to be FDA-approved. Again, as I understand this is not a requirement but is done largely to gain approval for medical usage in hospitals and clinics. Check out Medihoney dressings. BTW, I have also used this topically on oral canker sores with great effect! Sores dissappeared in days and not weeks! Applied directly 3 x day. Lastly, the other jar I use for tea and even coffee and it is delicious. It has a strong floral taste and finish (as would be expected) and is alittle more viscous than other Manuka honeys I have tried. I have tried nearly all Manuka honey brands from NZ as I visit often and find this to be a great option for those of us who need a high-quality active raw Manuka honey without paying a load for shipping up the stuff from down under. Or you can just ask a friend heading that way to bring you back some :P …",429 out of 436 users found this review helpful

 Terry's Milk Chocolate Oranges are a treat not to be missed!,5,"The first time I had a Terry's Chocolate Orange was during Christmas, when our local ""Superstore USA"" stocked them. I love chocolate. And orange-flavored things are among my favorite flavors. I never once imagined that combining the two flavors would yield one of my favorite desserts in the world! The folks in England got it right when they began to make Terry's Chocolate Oranges! Buying these in bulk are totally worth the price you pay for them - they are meant to be savored. One orange can last you a month if you really, really try - but they can also disappear in just a few hours, if you aren't careful! They might look like they're pretty delicate, but trust the label when you read ""Whack and Unwrap!"" Take the ball in your hand and turn the orange so the bottom of it is facing downward, find a sturdy surface like a kitchen countertop, then raise the orange up high, and whack it down hard onto the flat surface. You'll feel the individual ""slices"" form, and then you can unwrap, pick out a slice, and savor its delicacies! Buy them today, so this can remain a staple in Superstore's food store! I don't want them to disappear anytime soon! I'm going to order another case in a few weeks! 1,000,000,000,000,000 Stars, if possible!!! …",14 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on,5,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups. I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive. I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products. If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :) EcoBrew VS Solofill First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew. Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker. These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable! I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product. The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly. …",559 out of 562 users found this review helpful

 IT ACTUALLY WORKS!,5,"I received this for Father's Day last year. I was skeptical - but it actually works. I can put some tri-tip in the smoker and hang in the pool or chat with guests while keeping an eye on the large LCD display. The range is very good, I can sit in the pool with the display next to me on the deck (at least 20-30 feet away) or go back inside the house. It beeps and talks to you a few minutes before your food is at the desired temperature. I use it primarily for beef, and the settings (rare, medium, etc.) are pretty accurate. This is especially good for large cuts of beef since it is often difficult to gauge whether the meat is pink inside or not. I would highly recommend this. Easy to set-up, then all you do is select the type of meat and the desired cooking level. Pork and seafood default to only one setting choice (well-done) but you can just use the temperature readout to cook to the desired temp. …",33 out of 34 users found this review helpful

 My sheltie love these treats (and so does my sister's cat),5,"My 30 lb shetland sheepdog is picky. She's fed a high-quality food, and she only gets the best treats. No ""doggie junk food"" to be had in our household, no corn, no by-products, no treats pressed and colored to look like mini T-bone steaks (unfortunately, I don't eat as well as she does.... Doritos can pass as a meal for me). She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards. Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals. These really get her attention, and they were vital in training her to go potty as soon as I let her out into the backyard, to let me brush her teeth, and to walk nicely on a leash (nothing on our walks is more interesting than Mama or Daddy in possession of Zuke's Minis). My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag. She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken. It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, salmon, comes from salmon being the first ingredient on the ingredient list. The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy or stinky. Also, we've found that my sister's cat goes nuts for these Zuke's in the salmon flavor. They're not intended for cats, but my sister's cat apparently didn't read the package when she found and inhaled these. These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again. …",14 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Not Awesome,3,"I don't know how this stacks up against the Keurig brand drawer but I would hope for the price difference that it is a little more sturdy. Cons: - We have a B70 and it barely fits on this from front to back. - The whole drawer unit itself does not lay flat with the machine on straight, so I turned the machine diagonally so that it would not wobble. - The drawer does not open smoothly at all, it is very rough and is probably scraping paint off the bottom of the drawer. I'm hoping after it has been used a million times this will improve. - If you try pushing the thing on the counter the little white rubber feet come out. I'm glad I did it before I lifted the machine onto it because I would not have been happy to dump my new coffee toy over. - I feel like it could be a lot sturdier since it is meant to hold a $100+ coffee maker on it. There are a couple pros though, that earned the 3 stars: - It does hold 36 k cups. I read reviews on other products that don't actually hold the number of cups that it claims. At least this one really does. - The black color matches the machine nicely. - It gets those bulky boxes of k cups off of the counter. I still have partial boxes to stow somewhere (since I wanted more than 2 varieties in the drawer) but at least I don't have to keep them handy. All in all I would not buy it again and still might return it. It was cheaper than the other drawers I was finding but I feel like I got what I paid for. Sometimes it's worth a few more dollars to get something a little better. …",35 out of 38 users found this review helpful

 I'm hooked!,5,"I've always loved tea in general and prefer to drink tea over most other things. My story starts last year when I vacationed in Hawaii. I stayed at my buddies house and we made a trip to Costco. One of the items that he picked up was a case of Ito En Green Tea in a can, yes I said can. Being that it is always hot in Hawaii I was excited about trying this drink. We left the tea in his fridge over night and the next morning I opened my first can. It was surprisingly good. I would say it has a medium bodied taste that is very, very smooth. The colder it is, the better. I liked it so much, that's all I drank on my 2 week vacation. I actually drank so much, I had to keep going back to Costco to buy more. Anyway, I come back to California and the first thing I do is go to Costco hoping they have this tea. Sadly, they don't carry any non-sweetened teas in the store. It became painfully obvious how much soda, juice and sweetened drinks everyone drinks around here. Since I am a huge Superstore user, I searched and found this version of the tea in a bottle. No cans to be found on Superstore. I was worried it might not taste as good, but ordered the case anyway. To my relief, the plastic bottled version tastes just about as good as the can version. I've always preferred aluminum cans over plastic bottles, but I'll take what I can get. If the can version is a 10, then the plastic bottled version is a 9.5. I would say it has a very slight bitterness to it in the bottle. Bottom line is, this is some really good tea and it's healthy for you. If you want an alternative to sodas, I would definitely recommend this product. …",16 out of 22 users found this review helpful

They are nice mixed in trail mix for hiking, by the way. A five pound bag is a lot, but if you pack a few every day in the kids' lunch bags, they will disappear.

 Content means less than names,2,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed. Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food. Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm? …",6 out of 49 users found this review helpful
" Caramel Flavor So Mild, It Barely Exists...",3,"I love a cup of Starbucks coffee, and I love a good flavored coffee. When Starbucks announced Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I really looked forward to purchasing and tasting it. Caramel-flavored coffee is one of my personal favorites - as long as it is not sickenly artificial, e.g. Ghirardelli Chocolate Caramel flavored coffee. Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee. Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark. The Caramel Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no caramel odor and has even less caramel taste. Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging. In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup. This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the caramel flavor. Because the coffee does have a mild caramel tone, it actually has a bit of a burnt taste. I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Caramel Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew. If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's and put the word ""fusions"" in the search box. You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

" BEWARE!  Used to be good, now full of FILLERS!",1,"I've used this product for 9 years, ever since we went through puppy training with my dog. Since then, it's been a relatively healthy treat and a good tool for behavior reinforcement. I say relatively healthy because so many dog treats are full of wheat and other grain fillers. The Superstore product ingredient listing is for the OLD formulation. Let's examine the first 8 ingredients of that formulation: Lamb, Lamb Hearts, Lamb Kidneys, Lamb Lungs, Whole Wheat Flour, Rice Flour, Lamb Fat (Preserved with mixed Tocopherols and Ascorbic Acid source of Vitamin C) Sucrose. The first 4 ingredients are lamb, and so the inclusion of wheat and rice flour as the fifth and sixth ingredients, while not optimal, is allowable for texture. The lamb fat is perfectly good for a dog's diet, while the eigth ingredient, sucrose (table sugar) is not healthful at all. Presumably it was added for palatability, but as the eight ingredient overall, it might be an acceptable concession. Now, check out the new formulation's first 8 ingredients, from the Natural Balance web site: Lamb Lungs, Wheat Flour, Sugar, Lamb, Wheat Bran, Lamb Hearts, Salt, Rice Flour. Only 3 of the first 8 ingredients could be considered optimal for canine health: the rest is filler or worse. Wheat flour and sugar displace two meaty ingredients in the top 4, and SUGAR is now the third ingredient overall. SUGAR. Folks, this is NOT good for your dog. They've taken a mostly healthy treat and made it sweeter, pumped up the filler grains, and even increased how much salt is in it. This isn't a MEAT roll any longer, it's basically meat-flavored Doritos. AVOID this at all costs if you care about your dog and keeping him healthy for a long time. It's too bad that my dog loves this so much, because now I will have to buy a better, more healthful product, or make my own treats. SHAME on Natural Balance for junking up their product at the expense of the animals' health. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Excellent Allergy Response!,5,"My 10 year old cocker spaniel has been treated for chronic ear and paw yeast infections for the past 9 years. He's had chronic, stinky black gunk in his ears and a black waxy substance covering his toes. I would guess that I've spent thousands of dollars on vet visits, tests, shampoos, ear medications, wipes, antibiotics - you name it - none of which worked for more than a week. My vet even tried a ""new"" process where the dog's ears were filled with some type of medication every week (at the vets - $50 a week) for a couple of months - but there was no improvement. My poor dog has scratched himself raw and spent much of his day licking and digging at his yeast-encrusted paws or scratching his sore, smelly ears. Recently, I've been bathing him every 2 days with Malaseb Shampoo (which did seem to help), but he had to stand for 15 minutes with the shampoo covering him, before the medication could be rinsed from his skin. Poor little dog. While on a trip to Florida, I took my spaniel to a new vet who prescribed more ear drops, wipes, and shampoo in an attempt to help my dog. The vet asked me if I'd ever tried changing his food from Eukanuba, which he's been on since he was a puppy. No vet had ever mentioned that my dog could be allergic to his food and it seemed so simple. I found Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Venison at Petco and thought I'd try a food trial. What a difference! In the two weeks since he's been on this dog food his yeast infection appears to be gone. His ears are clear, with no discharge or irritation and the skin on his paws is starting to look pink and healthy. I can't believe the difference in such a short time! He's not scratching, either. The Florida vet had said that a food trial would require at least 2 months, but I'm seeing such an improvement in only 2 weeks. Pretty amazing! …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

Unfortunately, the chocolates I received were largely melted. I do not recommend the purchase of this item to be shipped to any region experiencing temperatures above 78 degrees. UPDATE: Received an e-mail, which read (in part) as follows: First, my apologies for not answering you earlier... I didn't notice there was a melting issue with your order till late last week while addressing a small more recent delivery problem. Anyway, as you have noticed with your order, melting can and does happen in transit, but luckily only with an insignificant number of our packages as we only experience about two dozen or three dozen a year out of well over 15,000 packages. Insignificant when view in percentage terms, but still most infuriating when this happens. The e-mail went on to note that they are replacing my order. I am stunned--I have had a melting issue before with a different chocolate company (remember, I live in Atlanta, Georgia, where summer temperatures are a bear), and I received nothing in the way of satisfaction. I figured it would be the same and didn't even bother to directly contact the company (a mistake on my part). I am *very* pleased with this level of service. …",61 out of 64 users found this review helpful
 So I guess only Rabbit Meat is Murder?,3,"Darn, you people are having alot of fun reviewing this item.... Personally, I don't know why some people get so offended by the consumption of rabbit. (I guess it's the cows and pigs and chickens' own darn fault for not being small, cute, and fuzzy...). Rabbits are very healthy, and they are actually helping with some hunger issues in developing countries. But again, if only cows and chickens were cute and fuzzy, too.... With that said, I'm a vegetarian. I find it rather hippocritical since alot of the people who get so offended with the consumption of rabbit would be perfectly OK with the consumption of beef or pork. Especially, beef, for example, causes alot of enviromental damage to the world and many end up living a far from favorable lives before the final slaughter due to supply and demand. No, I'm not saying that you should all go vegetarian as well, nor am I encouraging everyone to grab a knife and fork and start chasing after bunnies. I'm just saying... that rejecting so harshly on the simple notion that you think it is gross is rather close minded. Just saying that it's not for you would have been sufficient. …",26 out of 71 users found this review helpful
 Very poorly made  bad design,1,"Nothing else matters, the engineering on this thing will fail, and soon. No matter how convenient or easy, no matter the choices of coffee, forget everything else- there is a huge problem with the way they made the maker itself. The hinged clam-shell of the K-cup holder uses an amazingly poorly designed plastic track. This track is formed in a complex set of curves that the mated piece must follow. The pieces are simply bare, dry, plastic. Over time they start to drag and catch as they try to follow this complex curve as you open and close the clam-shell. When the inevitable dragging and catching starts, the K-cups suffer a jagged puncture from the upper piercing water fill piece. This is catastrophic because anything less than a perfect small hole allows coffee grounds to flood out the top of the K-cup during the brew. Once this happens, you will never know if the next brew will work normally or you'll get coffee grounds everywhere. Just Google Keurig hole problem. It is common and after taking this thing apart to see how it all works, obvious that the design is flawed. …",19 out of 27 users found this review helpful

 Surprise:  All of Xlear's Xylitol is from China!!!,2,"I was about to order Xlear's 5-pound bag of Xylitol when I decided to check out where it comes from. Like many people, I try hard to avoid any food products or ingredients from China. So I called the vendor of this product (the Vitamin Shoppe). They said I would have to call the manufacturer to find out and gave me Xlear's phone number (801-224-0937). That number wasn't too helpful because it didn't allow me to reach a live person, but after pursuing several extensions, I reached a live Xlear customer service rep at (877) 599-5327. She immediately and firmly said that all Xlear Xylitol comes from China. She added, ""Most of the Xylitol you're going to find WILL be from China."" As much as I love Xylitol, I'm determined not to buy any from China. For the past year, I've been buying one-pound bags of ""Emerald Forest"" xylitol from my local grocery store. The bags are marked ""Made in the USA / U.S.-Grown Birch Trees."" So the news about Xlear's origins came as a surprise to me. However, the 1-pound local bags of Emerald Forest cost $10 each, so I was searching for a better price. Guess I'll contact Emerald Forest to determine whether their larger sizes of Xylitol (the ones available on Superstore) are still from the U.S. I'm willing to pay more to avoid consuming any food or supplements from China. And since erythritol is so similar to xylitol, this leaves me wondering where erythritol comes from....Has anyone checked that out? Decided to finish checking things out before posting this review.....So I just located emeraldforestsugar dot com, got the corporate phone number (866-948-1999) and immediately reached a live person. She double-checked with a manager, then confirmed that even the largest sizes of Emerald Forest Xylitol sold on Superstore are indeed totally produced in the U.S.A. and that all Xylitol labeled ""Emerald Forest"" is strictly from U.S.-grown trees. (And by the way, she mentioned that the mfr sells a 55-pound bag of U.S. xylitol, though I haven't had time to check out the price yet.) This was all good news to me. While I was at it, I asked whether EF's erythritol is also made in the USA, and she said, ""Yes, but we're out of it right now--there's currently a shortage."" I also asked about their xylitol gum (since I regularly buy Trident w/xylitol) and was somewhat dismayed to learn that EF's xylitol gum is their only product that does contain some Chinese ingredients. But in about one month they expect to start producing a gum that is totally from U.S. ingredients. I'm giving this Xlear product only 2 stars because although Xylitol itself has worked great for me, I think the origin of this food product should have been clearly listed! …",162 out of 181 users found this review helpful
 White Gold Honey is a Great but where's the honey?,4,"Well after some hours on the internet looking for a truly RAW honey I stumbled on this and decided why not give it a try. After receiving it in the mail I realized that 23oz wasn't much at all, but I guess that's the price you pay for unheated, untreated honey these days. With my first spoonful it was quite clear that this was honey was well above par. Consistency is great, not runny but not stone hard either; texture is smooth & soft, and taste is very unique for a honey. It tastes more like candy to me then actual honey. Very sweet, mild tasting. For some this may sit well but for me I was looking for something more ""earthy,"" more ""organic."" Bottomline: An excellent honey if you are interested in something RAW, SWEET tasting, & very MILDLY aromatic, but other then that I would recommend to others. Update: I recently picked up Stakich's Manuka Honey and I must say it's really a spectacular tasting honey, exactly the taste I was looking for, although the consistency was a bit more runny then I wanted.

 A Reliable Product - Makes delicious breads...,5,"If you love using your bread machine and want a reliable yeast that does not need to be proofed (can't remember the last time I did that), then this yeast will make your life much easier. While this is not a rapid yeast, the bread does seem to rise more quickly than with packets of yeast from the grocery store. This saves time and gives you an empowered feeling instead of the ""Is this going to rise or not?"" feeling. The yeast can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer and is very convenient to use. Unlike the yeast cakes, you don't have to worry about mixing it with water or milk. You just measure it into the bread machine. Here is the recipe I love making for Focaccia bread. It turns out wonderful and you can start it in the bread machine or make it by hand. We serve this in slices or squares topped with butter and fresh rosemary or an herbed cream cheese. Perfect with homemade soup in the winter. Focaccia for the Bread Machine (start in machine, finish by hand) 2 1/2 cups water 2 tablespoons Saf instant yeast 2 tablespoons sugar 2 teaspoons freshly crushed sea salt 2 tablespoons olive oil 6 cups all-purpose flour (the Baker's Catalogue sells an amazing flour) Measure the water, yeast, sugar, salt, olive oil and flour into the bread pan. Program for white bread, dough cycle and large loaf. After the dough has been kneaded, you can put it in a large stainless bowl and cover the dough with a damp cloth. I normally forget it is in there and catch it just before it is about to rise over the top of the pan, so it still works, either way. You could also use half the ingredients for just one loaf if you want to let it rise in the bread machine pan. Let it rise until double in a warm place. My secret it to turn the oven on and then almost immediately off (just leave it on until you feel some heat on your hand) and this seems to create a ""just warm enough"" environment for bread to rise. Punch down and divide into thirds. Roll out two squares and one elongated loaf. This works well on the regular size cookie sheets. If you have a larger cookie sheet, you can roll the dough into two 8-inch squares. Make deep indents with the end of the rolling pin handle at regular intervals. Then brush with olive oil. Let the bread rise until almost doubled. Either sprinkle with sea salt or sprinkle with dried or fresh rosemary and sea salt. You can also top the dough with tomato slices, onion slices and sliced and pitted Kalamata olives before baking. Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. After the bread cools, it will slice easily and it freezes very well. I normally slice two loaves and cut one into squares for sandwiches. To make an Herbed Cream Cheese: Blend together 1/3 cup butter, 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, 2 teaspoons dried parsley, 2 teaspoons dried rosemary and 1 teaspoon dried thyme. The idea for this bread came to me after visiting a sandwich shop at a garden center in Seattle. After arriving home from visiting my grandmother, I knew I had to try to make the cream cheese and the bread because they were perfect to serve with homemade soup. This bread has a lot of possibilities so you can vary the toppings to suit the types of soups you are serving. The Instant yeast always works and with a bread machine, you end up feeling like a professional baker. The results are sure to impress. The bread always has a ""fresh from the bakery"" taste unlike the taste of breads made with packets of yeast. ~The Rebecca Review …",52 out of 56 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 14 users found this review helpful

But the taste- Oh, the taste is magnificent! It is probably the best honey I ever tasted and goes GREAT in brewed cinnamon tea. It has a real light smooth flavor (not ""bitey"" like some honeys).

 Worth Every Penny - Wellness CORE dry and Wellness Grain Free canned,5,"Over the last two years, our older cat (now 11 years old) had ongoing issues with diarrhea and vomiting. After several trips to the vet and numerous tests that found nothing wrong, we were left thinking that this was her lot in life, sensitive to hairballs with a testy stomach. We changed her to a vet-recommended food and went on with life, but as you can imagine, she was still suffering. She was dehydrated, her coat was rough, she was losing muscle and constantly hungry because she was essentially living life as a non-voluntary bulimic. At one point, I hoped a test for her thyroid would be positive so we could just figure out what on earth was wrong with her. Last month I decided I didn't have anything else to lose so I started researching holistic treatments for her various symptoms. I happened upon a description of grain allergies in cats and I was astounded at the number of symptoms she had. Her eyes were always watery, her lips and gums a little swollen, and these were things her vet and I had attributed to ""getting older"" or her ""hairball sensitivity"" since none of the test had pinpointed a problem. After some research to select a quality brand, I ordered Wellness Core Dry and Wet food. I didn't bother to transition her, just started her on it right away. Besides, she wasn't keeping down much of the other food anyway. She took to it right away, and she's a picky one. Within two days, the diarrhea was gone. Within a week, she brought up a hairball that would shame a lesser cat. It's been a month now and the only bad thing I can say is that I wish I'd found this food sooner. No more watery eyes, no more swollen lips, and no more noxious fumes from the litter box. My husband and I cannot believe that fact, but it is true. A high-quality food WILL reduce litter box odor. I didn't believe it until I...well...didn't smell it. I'm transitioning our other cat to it now and he already looks better for it. The food has a stronger odor than store-brand cat food. You'll also want to note that it doesn't have preservatives, so it's bound to have a stronger smell. The wet food actually smells good, for cat food. We use the Wellness Core 3oz Grain-Free Chicken. I'm sure our experiences will vary, but I've watched a cat who was the epitome of finicky, who would turn her nose up at Fancy Feast if the same flavors were served back to back, gobble the same flavor everyday for the last 30 days without complaint, and most notably, without vomit. So I'd say she gives her claw of approval. Bottom line? It's pricy, sure. But it's worth it for us. Considering the money we're saving in paper towel clean up expenses alone, we're probably saving a buck or two. I should also thank Superstore for making it Prime eligible, so it's easier to buy it here than to find it in the store. So now, instead of begging me to feed them, our cats can start mauling the UPS man. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 What a rip-off!!!,1,"These boxes are very small! Each is 1.2oz ... yes, you read that right, ONE POINT TWO OUNCES! About the size of a box of raisins. At $5/box you would think you would get something more substantial. I ordered these for a party, thinking the kids could share it. Ha! I'm embarrassed to even bring them out :( …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Several packages for the same yummy product,5,"OK, so I'm used to drinking (and have a preference for) the cans that have the aluminum top you peel back--it's a teeny tiny frustration to have to, well, clean the inevitably dusty, traveled top of any can, whether with a damp towel, rinsing, or my shirt if I'm not feeling particularly energetic. That said, the price through Superstore (at $2 higher than The Chef's Warehouse that charges $9.95 for shipping) is much better, and this is JUST the kind of thing that, while it's pretty near-identical the price of my local grocer, I appreciate not hauling far. Now about the soda... I'm NOT a soda drinker. I abhor that corn syrupy colored mess called cola (though Cheerwine keeps a spot in my less than three!)... in general, my stomach, as I sort of banned this drink category for 360+ days a year at the age of 13, gets very upset when carbonated water is put in it, especially with caffeine in most carbonated things... and another interesting tummy woe is orange juice. Unless it's fresh squeezed and ""normal"" orange juice (not the awesomely rich Florida kinds of oranges), well, I'm sorta not able to handle that, not even after prilosec entered my world. Now for the confusion. This stuff... it tastes amazingly fresh, the carbonation isn't excessive, with 18% juice, I get some natural vitamin C (pills are no good anyway, not for 99 thousand out of 99,001 people), and I'm not drinking pure buzzed OJ. I am also not getting mouth sores or anything of the sort that I recall getting when OJ was one of those everyday 12 ounces of it items... yeah, I wasn't terribly smart, but then again, metabolism of a hummingbird forgives just about all food habits... I'm older, wiser (don't use semicid), and this is that mature drink for me... I think it is perfect for people who, like me, can't do straight OJ, who can't quite bring themselves to inhale pure sugar/corn syrup sodas, who don't want their drinks tasting like food coloring, you get the picture... it just tastes like a fresh citrus spritzer, like the bubbling of champagne with the juice content of a margarita and no alcohol. If you like tonic water, this could replace that kind of unhealthy addictive drink (for your eyes in particular, as quinine leads to blindness when used for more than a couple months). If you like margaritas or screwdrivers or want some fizz without it being fake Fanta fizzle, then this is what to drink. It isn't particularly surprising (to me) that this happens to be my run-to drink when I'm eating cheesy Italian foods... it seriously was made FOR rich Italian dishes (seafood, I'm not so sure on--I think vino would be better for fish dishes)... plate me up something with creams, cheeses, maybe prosciutto and butter sauces, etc... and this somehow feels like its bubbling acid is helping my stomach along--maybe just because the most healthy of adult tummies still (well, when the diet has gone adult and is less saturated with fats, less gooey, less fried, less American in general) have some trouble digesting cheese on cheese on gooey awesome cheese with some roasted-in-olive-oil veggies, of course, and the occasional land mammal commonly consumed in Italy. My point? If you're eating pizza, calzone, lasagna, or even other Euro-derived foods... or if you're eating some fried chicken, even, this drink is an amazing counterpart. If you take anything like proton pump inhibitors regularly (prilosec, aciphex, etc., or even zantac types of meds), then this could be that perfect add-on when you go off your healthy food diet and splurge for something you know might irritate. No, I'm not selling it as a medicine, though mmm this DOES remind me of when cola used to be good stuff (when it was just a bit of sugar and when real cherries were in the cup) and why they decided to put some things in such syrups to deliver more effectively... it's darn good stuff. It's NOT your everyday soda. To my knowledge, they are adamant against using corn syrup, and having had the stuff in blue, in pale blue/yellow, and in a couple other cans, also having had it in glass bottles (panna is also made by them, so you can imagine the quality of the water that goes into this drink!)... well, it's all been some water, some OJ, some sugar (but not a lot), some natural CO2, and ... maybe natural flavor? Hmm, would have to get off my currenly lazy rump (with a currently terrible signal to post this review) and check... but I do indulge in this one soda here and there, despite ""knowing better"" from years in med school and more years teaching integrated nutritional sciences alongside medicine (to try targeting the source of so many health woes, we really DO have to check in on our diets!)... As long as it stays caffeine free and low on the carbonation (which is reckless and artificial in US sodas--really disgusting and rather harmful)... then I'll drink this... not daily, but maybe go through a 6 pack or 2 in a month, depending on just how often I do splurge on foods that my stomach feels just a bit... weighted down by... and I can even drink it on an empty stomach, meaning the carbonation is seriously low compared to our crazy sodas and ""energy"" drinks. Mmm, I think my lazy rump might need a bit of sizzling refreshment in the form of aranciata san pellegrino... the healthiest soda I've found SO FAR that still keeps its cost around a buck with tax. …",17 out of 29 users found this review helpful
 Eases my Morning Sickness!!,5,"I am a very healthy person. I eat organic foods, take good vitamins etc. I never thought I needed magnesium in my diet since I ate so well. I am currently 2 months pregnant and have had awful morning sickness lasting all day. My mother recommended this product to try. I called my Dr and she said it would be just fine during pregnancy, so three days ago I gave it a try. OMG 10 minutes after I drank it my morning sickness was gone!

 MADE IN CHINA,1,Does anyone here really want to feed their dogs anything made in china???? I love my dog. I would never do it. I contacted Dogswell. I've done hours of research on dog food. Here is what I found. Australia is trying to break into our market with a dog food called ZIWI PEAK. Check it out. I can't imagine Australia wanting to kill our pets as china does. This food is supposed to be awesome. It is not dry but dehydrated. Also Orijen and don't forget Wellness all made here in the good old USA. …,6 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Great Food for the Money,5,"I spent a great deal of time researching premium dog foods on the internet and at my local Natural Pet Foods store when I finally came to realize what a subpar product that Science Diet has been producing and calling themsleves a ""premium"" product. Once I learned what constitutes a quality kibble, i.e. meat and meat based products, no corn fillers, chelated minerals, all natural products - I could go on and on. Based on the quality of ingredients, the high ratings given by a number of respected dog food reviews and forums, and its price point, I decided to give Chicken Soup For The Dog Lover's Soul a try. I did a slow changeover with my 7 year old chocolate lab in order to use up the balance of the old food. After now several months on the new Chicken Soup food, I feel comfortable in stating that this is probably the best dog food kibble you can buy for the money. My lab loves it - her poops are firm and effortless - her coat has a sheen and luster that we never saw with the Science Diet - her minor dandruff problem has disappeared - she doesn't scratch or itch at all - and she looks forward to her mealtimes. Yes, there are higher quality kibbles available, but at his price point and with this list of quality ingredients, you can feel comfortable that you are feeding your dog a premium quality dog food without breaking your budget. Highly recommended! …",53 out of 53 users found this review helpful
 My Baby Didn't Take to It,2,"I picked this up from my local left-wing health food store thinking I was saving a bundle over my baby's usual brand of formula. Upon following directions, I thought the yellowy-brown liquid looked more like a sick mother than healthy breastmilk! This stuff doesn't resemble anything close to milk for a baby. I give it two stars because my kid quit crying when the teapot whistled. A few moments of respite from colicky screechings is priceless, but I wouldn't recommend Mother's Milk as a substitute for breast milk, which as we know, is best. …",1 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Must have been a contaminated batch,1,"We bought a case of 12 12 oz cans back in April. Just now opened the first can. Wow. Consistency of vomit, grayish tinge, and a vile odor. Opened a second can -- exactly the same. No way were we going to feed it to our dog. Something was clearly wrong. We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase. Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA. …",20 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Tastes like Fish,2,"This stuff is barely acceptable. I have some Starbucks Tazo Matcha powder and thought this might be a close match in flavor. But, it's really funky tasting. I'd describe the taste like a cross between grass clippings from a lawn mower and a really strong fishy taste. I know the Starbucks Matcha has sugar mixed in there but even still, with a pound of sugar and cream you can still easily taste that fishy flavor. I pretty sure I would not buy again. BUT, the seller shipped it VERY fast and there were no problems otherwise. …",7 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 The Swedish Chef Would Be Proud!,5,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of all things swedish, from Lingonberries to salt cod to Lutefisk to those yummy red candy fish. When I saw that Jules Destrooper had invented yet another Swedish delectable, I could not wait for my package to arrive! After assaulting the UPS driver and absconding with my ""butter waffles"" (which are more like cookies), I went into my kitchen and sat down in my breakfast nook to eat them. A hearty glass of milk was all I needed to drench the entire box and consume it. In reality, I ended up saturating the cardboard box and must have eaten that as well, because when I was done there was nothing left save for some soggy nuggets stuck to my ceiling. I assume they are from my delicious waffles and not from my earlier experiment of stuffing a cornish game hen with popping corn to ""make its own stuffing."" I am still picking bits of hen from my bushy, inappropriately dark eyebrows. Also, some recipe ideas for these waffles include topping them with olives, tuna salad, anchovy and pretzel (an old Slavic favorite) and peanut butter. Sometimes I give these to the neighbor children when they behave themselves, and actually I have only given one out to one neighbor child. My neighbor's kids are usually misbehaving and absolutely do not deserve any of my tasty cookies! Anyway, it turns out the one kid I gave it to was actually a lawn jockey statue, which makes sense because my neighbors, the ""Davenports,"" have very light skin. They are actually quite pasty and I am waiting for the day when one of them develops melanoma, because they are always out in the sun, in their pool, having a ""heck of a time,"" under the sun's deadly rays, oblivious to the cellular damage they are inflicting on themselves. I prefer to stay inside during the daytime and nighttime hours, usually venturing from my house every fortnight to collect my mail. However, when I know a delivery of Jules Destrooper Butter waffles are arriving, I am on ""high alert"" and spring from my rascal mobility scooter whenever I hear a car door close. Overall, I LOVE these waffles. Buy them, and If you don't love them too, send them off to me!!! …",9 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Its OK,3,"Maybe it's due to my tendency to prefer noodles with a little more ""kick"", but I found this product to be very bland and not very flavorful. Of all the noodles produced by Nong Shim, this is my least favorite. The flavor is extremely subtle (it almost has a chocolate taste!) and its almost like eating noodles plain. If you like even mildly spicy noodles you will probably not like this at all and I would suggest going with any other flavor -- they are all good. This honestly is the very first Nong Shim noodle that I was disappointed with and I've tried a lot of them. Of course with food its all subjective. If you don't mind a very subtle flavor you might like this. I would recommend finding a single packet to try before you buy a package of 20, unless your tastes lean toward the less flavorful side. …",12 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Good enough but horrible packaging,3,"My baby isn't the fondest of this cereal if I just mix it with water but he will drink it if I mix it with Earth's Best powder formula and put it in a bottle. The good thing about this cereal is that it is small enough that it will pass through most nipples (if you want to put it in a bottle in case your baby has difficulty eating from a spoon in the beginning). My baby doesn't have any difficulty digesting it. So the cereal itself is fine. The bad part of this product is the packaging. When I received the Superstore box containing 10 of these, the cereal flakes were already all over the box even though it wasn't apparent that any cereal box exploded. It was a pain cleaning it up. Then I opened the clear wrap on one individual cereal box. Again, the cereal flakes were all over the place. It was a pain cleaning it up. Then the way to dispense the cereal from the box is not very good - it is made of paper, it doesn't seal well once opened (so I am afraid ants may crawl in) and the opening is too big.... so every time you pour the cereal into a bottle, the cereal goes all over the place. I think they should just have it in a can with a scoop like Earth's Best's formula. …",8 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 CANIDAE - a best choice for Fido or FiFi,5,"I searched for a food that wasn't full of preservatives and fillers, and didn't cost $5 a pound. I did alot of research and read alot of labels. I have a Siberian Husky pup, and Canidae has really proven itself to me. As a former conissour of cheap discount store dog foods, I have finally realized the advantages of feeding a natural premium food. My dogs poop doesnt really stink! True! Poop is still poop, but the smell is minimal. I have noticed it also quickly disinigrates into the ground when it rains. With the cheap food, it smelled like rank dog poop! Would make you retch and gag! And there was so much of it! Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day. AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog! A food that swells up when wet is also undesirable. Flint River Ranch brand and Canidae both stay intact, avoiding the bloat factor. I learned, you can learn too! It's also an excellent value - Try Canidae, you'll see! …",55 out of 57 users found this review helpful
