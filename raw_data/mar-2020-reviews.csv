 These Apricots Aren't Dried Properly,1,"One star. These Apricots aren't dried all the way through. Some of them were fine, but others were wet inside and tasted off. They gave me a stomach ache and the runs. They were even stored in the refrigerator after opening. I ended up throwing out the rest of the first package. I thought I just had gotten a bad batch. When I went to open the second bag, I noticed that two of the remaining bags (out of the 6 pack) were fat with air - like they could explode eventually. That is bacteria inside giving off their gaseous byproduct. If you've ever seen a can of food that wasn't properly canned, you'll know what I mean. They can rupture. I threw out the remaining bags because Superstore only has a thirty day return policy. Don't waste your money! There are better dried fruits out there that won't make you sick. …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 tasty Maybe beneficial,5,"My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two. At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
" great yeast, but be aware that you're using mutants",5,"This is really good stuff. Last long in the fridge, works great in machines, and there's no need for proofing (adding water to Active Dry yeast, and some flour, and letting it sit for a while before adding it to the rest of the mixture). Two things to remember: 1. When using this, mix it well into the dry ingredients. If you just dump it into the water, it may clump together and you wind up with a clump of yeast in your bread. If you're using a bread machine, no worries, because if you follow the machine instructions (making a little ""volcano"" in the flour, putting yeast in the volcano hole) it'll do it for you. 2. make no mistake, you're using mutant yeast. Instant yeast is created through protoplast fusion, where two different strains of yeast are combined into one. One of the types is usually a mutant yeast to begin with. any difference, health or taste wise? dunno. but once in a while i like to use cake yeast (the high-moisture ""fresh"" kind), or sourdough from my own starter (look on the net for instructions on how to make starters), and i like to think that i can taste the difference (and human history!) kev …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Two Paws Up!,5,"My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them. But I needn't have worried, they loved it! The Tuna Too Cool is a rich-looking, reddish pate with lots of jelly on top and my twosome were wolfing their portions down and got into a bit of a scuffle over the last couple of mouthfuls. They have no higher praise. …",24 out of 25 users found this review helpful

 The Cure,5,"It is the 11th of May, 2011. My doctor has just informed me that my Jimmies are terminally rustled. I had no idea how to react. Would any reaction I had be legitimate? Or would it be tainted by the state of my Jimmies? I've been living with RJS (Rustled Jimmy Syndrome) for almost a year now. I've tried more ""cures"" than would intimidate even a cancer patient. At first I tried wearing a three-wolf shirt. It helped with my self-esteem, but it didn't do anything about my Jimmies. I even tried buying a $2,000 HDMI cable, hoping the multidimensional X-Rays that would be exuding from my television would be enough to unrustle my Jimmies on a molecular level. That was $2,000 wasted. I had no hope. That is, until I found Gorilla Munch. The primary ingredient in Gorilla Munch, Love(tm), provided high enough levels of necessary nutrients to unrustle even my Jimmies! After consulting my doctor, I've received the news that the rustling in my Jimmies is in regression, and I should expect to have completely unrustled Jimmies by August 2012. I cannot thank this cereal enough for what it's done for me. …",72 out of 72 users found this review helpful
 AWFUL!  there's better out there....,1,"My family has celiac disease and we were thrilled when a major company came out with a gluten-free version of their cakes. However, Betty Crocker's GF chocolate cake was not very good. The best gluten-free chocolate cake we've ever tried is the Gluten-Free Pantry's Decadent Chocolate Cake Mix. No comparison. Betty Crocker's had an ""off"" taste and nobody would finish it. I can serve the Gluten-Free Pantry's cake to everyone and nobody suspects it's gluten-free.

 Suprisingly good.,4,"Walden Farms salad dressings are a hit and miss. Some of them are a bit off, and some of them are really good, so I decided to try 'Asian' and was delighted. Wasn't sure what I was expecting, but the taste is very much like soy sauce with a slightly thicker consistency. I love to pour it over chicken or fish and then pop it in the oven. The only downsides have nothing to do with the quality/taste. 1, Sodium. This is to be expected with most salad dressings. If you eat it in moderation it shouldn't be an issue, but since it's zero calorie, some people think it's ok to pile it on. This isn't the case. 2, Price. The price tag might turn off the average consumer, but for me it's a trade off for the taste that I love and the zero calories/zero sugar advantages. If you're curious, and just want to try it out, I say go for it. If you're a dieter and are looking for a serious way to cut calories, I say DEFINITELY try it out. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 New formula,1,"My dogs have been on Canidae for the past several years and even the picky dog who has lost over half her teeth loved it. However, I recently bought a new bag of Canidae. The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula. I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it. The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything. I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat. NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags. Their response: ********* Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas. ********* I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it. And when they say they are getting positive feedback from our customers that are *actually* feeding the new formula, are they trying to imply that I only pretended to feed the new food?!?! …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Tasty protein. Watch the carbs.,3,"Very nice tasting protein powder. Tastes like a nice iced coffee. Doesn't dissolve completely, though. I mixed mine well, and it was still a little clumpy. Not enough to ruin the drink, but enough to get a couple surprises of powder. One thing I don't like is the amount of carbs. 12 grams is a lot when you're only getting 15 grams of protein. I do like that's it's low in calories, though. One of the lowest I've seen, and for a decent sized shake. …",21 out of 25 users found this review helpful

" Excellent to relieve muscle, joint pain, sleeplessness",5,"My 80 year old Mom suffered from excruciating back and muscle pain. When I took her to see an MD specializing in pain relief, he recommended she try using CALM first, stating many of his patients found significant pain relief by addressing their magnesium deficiency by taking CALM. After she successfully reduced the pain using CALM as part of the regimen prescribed by her MD, my husband and I started using CALM for our muscle and joint pains, (61 and 58) and also found relief from pain; we accidently discovered it promotes a good night's sleep when we missed taking it one night and did not sleep as well.

" Nice flavor, No Gluten, cooks FASTER than some other McDougall instant soups, thinner than other split pea one",4,"I had previously ordered and enjoyed the Split Pea with Barley by Dr. McD. I ordered this one this time because I saw it was lighter in sodium. It cooked up fine in two minutes of steeping in the hot water. It had a nice texture and flavor, but it was thinner than the Split Pea with Barley, which is why I liked the other one better. This cup of soup has 200 calories , 1 gram of fat, 13 grams of protein, 9 grams of fiber, and 360 mg of sodium. It boasts 30% of recommended daily value of Vit A and 12% of iron. The entire cup is considered one serving (which I specify as some McD cup products specify two servings per container.) For those who have issues with gluten, this has NO GLUTEN. For those who want a more healthful option in convenience foods/instant soups, this is a nice choice. Solid pea flavor, easy to fix, no animal products. A nice little soup. (But I do give a higher thumbs up to the one with barley). …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Very Impressed!,5,"I was at wits end with my chronic gastritis. I had been to several doctor's and had an endoscopy to find I had h. pylori and gastritis. The specialist put me on PPI's (proton pump inhibitors) which made me feel worse. They also put me on several antibiotics which made me sick and caused my candida to get out of control. After second dose of antibiotics I felt a little better but then back again. Doctor suggested another endoscopy which I refused and decided to go online and see what I could do naturally. I found Manuka honey which was over $100 a bottle and decided to look it up on Superstore as I have bought several items here that retailed well over $100 and found them here for a fraction of the price. I came across Wedderspoon Manuka honey and read alot of the reviews. While waiting for my honey to arrive I got 2nd degree burns on my arm and chest from boiling soup. I thought, gee, let's try the honey on the burns too since many of the reviews said it was great for burns. I must say my burns are healing beautifully from this honey and much better than any of the other ointments I was using. My stomach is gradually getting better and I dont have that sick gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach. I contacted the Wedderspoon company and was told that it can take a few months to rid myself of the h. pylori but even the antibiotics can take that long yet cause other problems. I just ordered my second jar and love the taste. I actually cannot wait to eat it. My mom also was suffering from allergies and took a teaspoonful a day and saw quick results. I am hoping this is the answer to my digestive problems. It has been a long hard road to find something that will actually cure this. I am optimistic that Manuka honey is my answer. I have to say alot of the reviews I read helped me make the decision to buy this great product and I hope to leave another review when I am totally healed. One last note..........I was very impressed with the fast delivery and packaging was great. I know some left bad reviews due to poor packaging but I am sure the company saw this and made some changes as both my jars were in perfect condition and arrived quickly and safely. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
" Yes, Virginia, was a very bad rabbit....",1,"When the mailman came, I ran excitedly out to meet him in the yard. Clad only in my fluffy lavendar slippers and a floral nightcoat...I am sure I was a ghastly sight...but I just couldnt wait one extra moment to finally get my hands on that rabbit! I was so excited...whole fresh rabbit. The glory of the purchase was stamped ""fresh"" all over the box in bright red ink, and the entire thing was wrapped in barbed wire. ""Interesting packaging"", I thought...then thoughtlessly put my ponderings aside and brought my prize into the house. In truth, I nearly stumbled over the welcome mat as I hurried into the house with my extra special Superstore delivery! Rabbit! All mine! How wonderful! I hadnt had rabbit in years! With much ceremony, I sat down with a box cutter and began to open the box. Then suddenly this hairless, headless beast came flying out as if propelled by a spring. It immediately landed on the table, and held up one of its forelegs. Although it no longer had paws, I got the distinct impression that the rabbit was flipping me off! The irreverant beast was clear in its defiance. Startled, I stepped back...I didnt quite know how to handle the situation. I was quite frozen in shock. The rabbit deftly kicked the box off the table and approached me with a confident swagger. It seemed to be sizing me up. The next thing I knew, the rabbit had seized the box cutter from my trembling hand. It weilded the blade with obvious expertise, waving it menacingly in front of my face. I found myself completely immobilized with fear...a wave of morbid awareness drifted over me. There was nowhere to run. Nowhere at all... The rabbit quickly stretched its naked, spindly legs and leapt from the table. Within moments, it began to hurriedly ransack the house. It spray-painted graffiti chickens all over my livingroom wall. It broke into my safe and stole jewels and money. It sold drugs and began extorting money from my neighbor. It took candy from babies. It sassed its elders. I even found it in bed with my husband. Despite my outrage, and efforts to trap the abhorrent creature, it quickly spread its attentions throughout the neighborhood...then, the city. It terrorized every man, woman and child...it spared no one. In desperation, I contacted the vendor for a refund. ""Oh hell no,"" the customer service man said. ""You wanted a fresh rabbit...and thats what you got. No refunds!"" Indeed, the rabbit was ""fresh"" and consequently recieved many outraged face slappings from local women. But I was desperate to be rid of the thing. I found myself, desperate...alone...with nowhere to turn.... I wept bitter tears at the prospect of my fate and the humiliation I had endured as the rabbit effortlessly dismantled everything I valued in life. My back was against the wall...I had no choice but to fight. The sound of my boots scraping upon the pavement of the sidewalk was comforting. I was ready. My jaw clenched and eyes squinted...I was pure courage. I was armed. On my belt I carried the weapons of my forefathers...a bubble pipe, a package of red vines, and a rubber mallet. I was ready to destroy, or be destroyed... The rabbit saw me and seemed to sense my determination. It had no head, but I sensed it sneering at me. With a warbling screech, the rabbit attacked me. It flew to action, attempting to cripple me with a spinning back kick and a flurry of karate chops. Gasping, I lashed back with my mallet, blowing my bubble pipe fiercely, and landed a hit soundly on the rabbits side. Before it could recover, I began lashing it with the red vines, leaving **** welts on its pale, graying flesh. It squealed in pain and squirmed behind a trash can, with me in hot pursuit... The rabbit unexpectly turned, and I made a grab at the skinny carcass, but it sped past meIt cursed me and fled. With no head, paws or fur, the animal was very streamlined and as fast as greased lightning. I doggedly pursued it to the edge of town when I lost sight of it...and I was relieved to see that the rabbit did not seem to be turning back. It seemed that as quickly as it began...the rabbit's rampage was over. The last time I saw the beast, I had been patrolling the city. I saw that it was armed with two automatic rifles and strings of ammunition, and it appeared Rambo-esque upon a hill. It screamed ""Aaaaaahhhhhyaaaaaa!"" and fired the weapons into the air. It then ran and jumped into a jeep with Charlie Sheen and sped away... I saw a mushroom cloud form in the distance... I looked into the sunset, my teeth gritted with determination. I would survive. And as god as my witness, I would never be hungry again! I sit my weary body behind my computer once again, mopping beads of cool sweat from my forehead. I begin write this review. Gingerly, I start to type....""Yes, Virginia, this was a very bad rabbit...."" …",19 out of 32 users found this review helpful
 Good Energy with No Jitters for me,5,"Despite it's juvenile sounding name, this isn't a child's energy drink that's for sure. Each tube packs about 42,000% the recommended daily dose of Vitamin B12. The high from this is extremely stable and hasn't yet given me the jitters. Everyone reacts differently though so to guarantee 100% that you will not get the jitters would be a lie. When I take it, I feel very awake, alert, and clear headed. I use it before a workout and several of the ingredients make it perfect for the gym. The let down is probably the smoothest you'll find among energy drinks. And if you feel a cold coming on, downing one of these may help tremendously. The name comes from the interaction the mix has with water. You pour one vile into a 16-20 oz bottle of water and the stuff fizzes like crazy! If you don't get the lid on fast enough, you'll quickly find there will be a mess! I've found using a wide mouthed nalgene bottle is the best way to prevent these types of accidents. In addition to the massive amounts of Vitamin B12, it has a good amount of Vitamin C (500mg), Niacin (10mg), Vitamin B6 (2.5mg), Calcium (60mg), Magnesium (100mg), and Potassium (905mg). It has almost every water soluble vitamin meaning that a lot of the excess that your body doesn't utilize, will be flushed through your kidneys. With that being said, drink a lot of liquid with this and don't over use the product (company recommends no more than 3 a day) or the chance of getting kidney stones exists. It has a 317mg ""proprietary"" blend blend of L-Arginine, L-Taurine, Caffeine from guarana, Alpha-lipoic acid, Grape seed extract, Green tea leaf extract, Ginger root, and Ginseng root. I don't know how much each compound contributes to the 317mg but they do acknowledge that 100mg of it is caffeine (about the same as a cup of coffee). There are multiple flavors but I'm partial to Grape and Orange Soda. The flavors are very sweet and candy-like but they surprisingly have no sugar. 10 total Calories and only 2g Total Carb. This is an excellent product and recommend it over any other energy drink. …",41 out of 42 users found this review helpful

 5 paws up! Expensive but worth every single penny,5,"I lost 2 cats from kidney disease (most likely caused by melamine-tained cat food in 2007-8). When I got my new fur-baby, I swore it would never happen again. While there are several promising options that provide excellent feline nutrition AND meet mama's exacting standards, the part I hadn't factored in was having a picky cat. Most canned food has a pate-like texture... which she won't touch. There are a few sliced/chunks in gravy options... she licks up the gravy and leaves the rest. Weruva, however, she gobbles right up. Licks the plate clean - even the flavors with peas and other veggies. I'm super impressed with this food - it meets my standards for food safety (grain free; human-grade; no yucky additives for color/odor/flavor; free range; hormone/antibiotic free, etc.) AND the darned cat will actually eat it. A few bonus features for this food: - It's the only canned cat food I've found that doesn't make me gag when I open the can. Looks appetizing, like you've opened a can of progresso or something. - Pleasant to non-existent odor when I open the can, spoon the food onto a plate, etc. My small apartment appreciates this! - If any shreds remain on the plate, doesn't gross me out to wash with the same sponge I use on my own dishes. - The... err.. end results in the litter box are also nearly non-existent as far as odor goes. My small apartment definitely appreciates this! I haven't tried her on any of the fish flavors (I can't stand the smell of fish at all and I'm not a fan of the Menadione that must be added to fish-based cat food), but here's my cat's expert opinion on the flavors she has tried: Paw Lickin' Chicken: Just plain and simple, shredded chicken breast in a light clear gravy. I think this is the one she gets least excited about, so I don't feed it too often. Grandma's Chicken Soup: One of her favorites. This flavor tends to have much more liquid and less meat than the others so I wouldn't use it as a primary food. However, I like to rotate this one regularly and feed it more often in warmer weather to ensure she's getting enough moisture. Also contains peas, carrots, & pumpkin. Funky Chunky: Probably her 2nd favorite. Similar to Grandma's Chicken Soup, but much less broth/gravy and much more meat. This one also has peas, carrots, pumpkin, and the shreds of meat are larger. Nine Liver: Her 3rd favorite, which surprised me. Shredded chicken breast and chicken liver, no veggies. The liver pieces are actually fairly small tidbits, not huge chunks like they look to be in the photos. Green Eggs and Chicken: Shredded chicken breast, peas, spinach, and little bits of egg. She isn't as fond of this one, so I've stopped buying this flavor. Pretty sure it's the egg she doesn't like, as she does like another flavor that contains spinach. Peking Ducken: By far, her favorite. Shredded chicken breast, small tidbits of duck breast, pumpkin. I was quite surprised by how much she loved this flavor -especially since I only bought the first can of Peking Ducken on a whim. (It would be one of the more expensive flavors!) On the Cat Wok: Another favorite. This one has shredded chicken breast and shredded beef, with pumpkin. Steak Frites: Shredded beef, sweet potato, & pumpkin. She prefers ""On the Cat Wok"" so I think she's not as fond of beef, but she's content to eat this flavor about once a week. I serve Grandma's Chicken Soup, Funky Chunk, 9 Liver, and Peking Ducken in heavy rotation, tossing in the occasional can of On the Cat Wok, Steak Frites, and Paw Lickin' Chicken. If your cat is extremely picky, I suggest trying Paw Lickin' Chicken. If you feed fish, I've heard that Mack & Jack is the kind cats like the most. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 reommend you avoid chinese sourced food products for your pet,1,"These chicken strips (and most others like them) are priced so low they are hard to resist. My dogs love them of course and for dogs who tolerate chicken, they should be excellent treats. However, I do not trust pet foods sourced from China. Most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets. It remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured. The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added. Many brands are irradiated (if this matters to you). Overall, I recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made 100% from US grown and processed ingredients. …",29 out of 33 users found this review helpful

 Great Xylitol,5,"I received this order of Xylitol with all 6 pouches in perfect condition, and already I've used it up! I love the taste and find that not only is the blood sugar reaction much more gentle than standard cane sugar, but after a month or so of eating it consistently I find it to be far more satisfying in general. A tip for sensitive people, especially those with candida issues (since Xylitol kills yeast): try only a little bit at first and slowly work your way up before cooking with large amouts. A couple interesting things I noticed while cooking with it is: after eating 3 pounds of xylitol a month, there was no weight gain, though the equivalent in cane sugar would have done so, and I've noticed my food keeps for ridiculously long amounts of time (I don't know if this is the xylitol specifically or another ingredient, but it seems to be this sugar). Overall, since this natural sweetener is safe eaten in moderation and in fact beneficial, give it a chance. Even if it doesn't become your only sugar, xylitol's excellent to have on hand. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful

I really like the fact that this comes packed in 10 individual packs of 8 k-cups each. The reason for this is that these k-cups are different in their construction. Each one is plastic at the top but filter for the lower 3/4 of the k-cup. At first I thought..oh no..I see a big mess coming, but to my great surprise, everything went perfectly.

" used to love it, but a scary experience for my golden raised questions",3,"I fed my two golden retrievers and cat Wellness products for a long time with good results. I really respect the approach Wellness has tried to take and always thought their ingredients were excellent. Their ingredient list is outstanding-- human grade meats and veggies/ a holistic health approach. Then we had a strange incident. I opened a new bag and gave it to my dog, and shortly after eating breakfast she became terribly sick for about a week---severe, severe diarrhea. I thought this was a weird coincidence, so I discarded the bag just to be safe, and went through another bag of Wellness with no problems. Then about a month later I again opened a fresh bag and my dog became terribly ill shortly after eating the first bowl-- same symptoms. (Both bags were not expired.) I can't help suspecting that something about how the ingredients were mixed in those bags made my dog terribly sick. I stopped feeding Wellness to my pets and we have had no further problems over the last 6 months. I should add that my dog had never had any allergy problems of any kind and has always been very healthy. She has never had a bad reaction to any food-- she is a chow-hound and does not have a sensitive system. I reported our experience to the store where I purchased the food and they agreed to notify Wellness. I don't know if the company has looked into this issue or not. If your dog stays healthy on Wellness I would still support it as a good choice given the ingredient list. However, if your dog has symptoms like my dog's symptoms, I'd suggest to you take that seriously and switch foods. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Terrible Customer Service from Euro Food Mart,1,"I ordered this item and several other choclate items from Euro Food Mart and was sorely disappointed in the products I received. They arrived melted. I didn't realize that I needed to have them shipped EXPEDITED. I mistakenly assumed that by paying $12 for shipping, the items would arrive with some kind of coolant. Previous to placing the order I clicked on the Shipping link for detail, and perused the chart that appeared. I failed to scroll down and see the information stating that in order to assure the use of ice gels, orders needed to be Expedited. So, on a $26 order, I would pay an additional $30+ for Expedited delivery. When I initially received my melted chocolates, I contacted Euro Food Mart and received a very rude and curt reply from Cris in Customer Service informing me that during the checkout process I was offered shipping with ice gels, but I chose to decline it. Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated. They cracked easily and no filling was discernable. This chocolate bar in particular was disappointing in texture as well. Admittedly, it was my mistake not to notice the note on Expedited shipping, however, the response from Euro Food Mart's Customer Service lacked objectivity. My rating reflects my entire experience....quality of shipped product and customer service experience with Euro Food Mart.

 Good formula but doesn't contain DHA or ARA,3,"Just to clear up some confusion here is the quote from the manufacture's website: ""Baby's Only Organic® Dairy-based Toddler Formula contains alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA), the fatty acid precursors for Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Arachidonic acid (ARA)."" Conversion of ALA and LA by the body to the more active longer-chain metabolites is inefficient: 2-5% for DHA.

 I Would Buy Elsewhere,2,"I got my agar agar yesterday, and I feel like I've been scammed. The only reason I chose to buy from Barry Farm was that it was the cheapest option. But that wasn't the case. When I first held the package (which is smaller than what is pictured here), I thought it was oddly light for 4 oz. So I weighed it on my military grade digital scale and bingo, it's 3.2 oz. Without the packaging that would mean 3 oz. I thought it might be my scale so I weighed my mineral makeup that came on the same day, 1.3 pounds each for a 1 pound bag. So Barry Farm only shipped me 3 oz of product when I payed for 4 oz, which doesn't seem like a lot but when you do the calculations it's quite a dent. Let me compare this to the other agar option on Superstore by NOW Foods. Barry Farm (3 oz) $7.90 + $7.13 (Shipping) = $15.03 (Comes in a plastic Ziploc bag) NOW Foods (2 oz) $4.20 + $5.38 (Shipping) = $9.58/2 = $4.79/oz * 3 = $14.37 for 3 oz (Comes in a plastic bottle) NOW Foods (32 oz) $40.79 + $7.55) = $48.34/32 = $1.51/oz *3 = $4.53 So including shipping, Barry Farm $15.03/3 oz NOW Foods $14.37/3 oz NOW Foods $ 4.53/3 oz With a bottle instead of a plastic bag, my future purchases would be from NOW Foods. I'm so tempted to get the 2 Pound bottle since an ounce is only $1.51 that way, but agar's gelling quality is so good that it gets used very slowly. Now about the agar. I cooked it last night (1 Cup apple juice to 1/2 teaspoon powder), and left it in the fridge. This morning I woke up to see it gelled quite nicely. It doesn't have the doinky texture of gelatin jello and it's much harder to the touch. I tasted it and didn't notice an exponential increase in the taste of apple juice, and the texture of the agar isn't as good as gelatin jello. It sort of just breaks apart in your mouth like...sand maybe? But at least it's supposedly healthy. So in terms of Barry Farms I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because at least the product worked. But not going to buy from them again since I don't know if I'll be cheated. Internets a scary place where merchant reputation is very important. They should have put more product in the bag to ensure it measures at least 4 oz. Now their reputation is tarnished. …",159 out of 164 users found this review helpful

 DISGUSTING with a Capital D,1,"Why put unsweetened ingredients in one of these bars? Unsweetened chocolate? Disgusting. This product lacks flavor and is way too heavy and dense. I also don't know what could be nastier than unsweetened coconut. It needs to be lighter in texture and a lot sweeter (not cloyingly so) and then this might be at least tasty. As it is, it is a waste of money and an absolute disappointment. To the manufacturer: look for inspiration in the flourless chocolate cake sold at Trader Joe specifically for gluten free diets, and check out the flavorful almond horn by Aleia. Both are mildly sweet, but full of flavor. The chocolate flavor pops in the mouth and makes you forget that it has no gluten in it. The almond horn delights you with the fragrance before it ever hits your mouth. Both go great with tea, coffee and fruit, particularly the cake goes well with fresh stawberries. Maybe you just need to stick to a core ingredient and work around it. There is too much nastiness going on in this disgusting bar. This is a terrible product that cannot be recommended. There are just way too many nasty gluten free products on the market, and this should be placed exactly where I just put it, in the garbage. More $$ down the drain and continued disappointment reigns. I am being brutally honest because I was recently diagnosed with a gluten allergy and have exceedingly fond memories of all of the delicious wheat-based offerings I used to eat and I naturally expect to be able to partake delicious gluten-free substitutes, espcially since they usually cost twice as much as the products containing gluten. This is no substitute for the wheat-based version, to say the least. …",3 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 The flavours are not lies!,5,"These beans are a wonderful thing. The good flavors, you can eat, and they are totally fantastic. The terrible flavors, you can belittle the manhood of your friends with. The in-between flavors? Like grass? They're largely there to confuse you, and do so wonderfully. To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote: Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. ""Okay,"" I begin ""but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth."" My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt! Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. ""Alright,"" they said ""This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow."" Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth. It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg! Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful. The rotten egg, dirt, soap, and vomit beans all taste exactly what they are supposed to. And that is what makes them a fantastic product. …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful

Flaxseeds are loaded with minerals, vitamins, amino acids, and fiber. They are excellent for weight loss and work well for chronic constipation.

 Love at first bite!  Tongue-puckering tang and crunch!,5,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy. I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten. It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since. Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly. I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch. Isn't that poetic? As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C. My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches. I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch. Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course. My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them. That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Not the real deal,1,"Kikkoman mirin is probably what's called mirin-fu chomiryo (literally mirin-like seasoning). It's certainly not hon mirin (true mirin). If you look at the ingredients list, you'll see a big give away: Rice, Water, **Corn Syrup**, Alcohol, Salt. I'm not even sure this is made with rice wine. It's got rice and (a very little) alcohol in it, but it's sweetened with corn syrup. That's not mirin. Real mirin is sweetened by rice that has been subjected to the Aspergillus oryzae fungus, which breaks down the rice starches into sugar. It's what's used in the production of sake. Mirin uses the same fungus to produce the unfermented sugars that sweeten this essential Japanese cooking wine. If you're looking for the real thing, go to an Asian market and check the labels. Anything with sugar or corn syrup in it isn't authentic. Eden Foods also makes a widely available and very good mirin made from organic brown rice, rice koji (Aspergillus oryzae), pure water and sea salt. (The salt in mirin sold in the US is not authentic either, it's added to calssify the wine as cooking wine, thereby avoiding alcohol taxes). Do yourself a favor, read the labels and opt for authenticity. You won't regret it. …",39 out of 40 users found this review helpful

 Mouth watering!,5,"Over the last 3 years I have sampled every major protein bar offering and I have to say these Power Crunch bars are my favorite. It has a very sugary, chocolate taste that is similar to real chocolate wafer cookies. Power Crunch does not have the thick, hard protein ""paste"" you'll find in most bars. The chocolate wafer style is soft and almost disintegrates in your mouth - quite a contrast from most protein bar offerings. I've eaten probably a dozen a week for the last six weeks and I still cannot get enough of these bars. In all fairness most protein bars have 30+ grams of protein - more than double the amount than the 14 grams in Power Crunch. So personally I consider Power Crunch to be a very healthy high protein candy bar rather than protein bar. But after tasting Power Crunch, it'll be a long time before I reach for another Detour, MET-Rx, Oh Yeah, South Beach, or any other bar. …",29 out of 30 users found this review helpful
 Titan Loves his ZiwiPeak Venison!,5,"This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain. More on that later.... Some background: My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier. He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband). He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food. Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison. Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Superstore. I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...). So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats. Titan went mad for them. It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares. You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky. But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw. Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door. He barely lifted his head from the bowl. For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France. When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure. Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine. Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept. When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet. I added a little canned venison to entice him. No go. Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating. Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there. Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag. Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag. I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time. The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO! But back to my point: I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!). So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain. And, it is high quality. Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam? Titan's never had that with this stuff. I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up. So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line. I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!). I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well. …",18 out of 20 users found this review helpful

" It's edible, but I would only use it for deep frying....if at all.",1,"Olive oil is a slippery subject.... There are LOTS of different types of olive oil, usually differentiated by: Extraction method Pressing (1st, 2nd, 3rd...) Cold pressed Hot pressed Solvent extraction Pomace is what's left of the pressed olives after the final pressing. Pomace is the lowest grade of oil which is edible (and some pomace is inedible.) Edible doesn't mean tasty. The vast majority of knowledgeable olive oil consumers wouldn't consider eating pomace grade. Generally the worst of the plain olive oils has considerably more flavor than pomace. Where you aren't looking for flavor, then pomace is possibly appropriate, but it should be much cheaper than plain olive oil. It is appropriately used as you would sunflower, corn or other neutral flavored cooking oils. Many in the USA like extra-virgin oil, but most Europeans prefer virgin, as it has more of the olive bitterness. Most in the USA have palates which are trained to dislike anything bitter. Most in the USA have been raised on vegetable oils which have little or no flavor (the advertising boasts about this fact.) If you want an oil which won't affect the flavor of your food much, then this is an o.k. product. …",21 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 Could be OK if not for the artificial sweetener and flavors,2,"The product's name lead me to believe it would be naturally flavored with flavors I like. Unfortunately, the flavor of the artificial sweetener is very pronounced and it is a flavor I strongly dislike. I do not use artificial sweeteners and avoid artificially sweetened beverages because I do not like the flavor, not for health reasons. I used one packet per 24 oz bottle of water and I am sure that if I were to mix it per instructions it would be way too sweet. I was not able to taste honey or pomegranate. Blackberry is somewhat pronounced, although not as a natural but as an artificial blackberry flavor. I also had a problem with packaging. When I tore the corner of a packet at notch, the resulting hole was too small for the contents to pour out. I had to jiggle the packet and push the contents out. That created a cloud of fine dust which I inhaled - not pleasant. I struggled with the second packet as well. It is possible that it is just the batch I received that did not have the tear notch punched properly. The description says ""Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors."" I am surprised this kind of marketing is allowed or tolerated. It is just as much (probably more if you consider contribution to the total sweetness) sweetened with artificial sweeteners as it is with honey. As for the green tea or pomegranate flavor... Who can tell that this tastes anything like either one of those things? It seems like a manufacturer can show to a cousin of a random employee a picture of tea leaves and pomegranates and let them listen to bees buzzing and then claim that the product was made with tea leaves, honey, and real pomegranate flavor. I would not buy this product the way it currently is. …",17 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 I love Fog Chaser,5,"Fog Chaser is my favorite coffee and I buy it in whole beans for when I brew a full pot. I have used it for years and would not think of changing. When I saw Superstore had Fog Chaser for the Keurig I was thrilled. The flavor is full bodied and rich with a very smooth finish. Because I was familiar with Fog Chaser, I never even looked at the reviews before I made my purchase. Therefore, I was rather surprised when I opened the box and saw the different type of pod. With a filter bottom the pod seems much more environmentally friendly. There was no residue at the bottom of my mug so the filter did a good job. I agree with other reviewers of the need to keep these pods in a vacuum sealed container (or zip lock bag) but I think the use of less platics is a good thing. I have a B60 and these fit perfectly in the machine. I used the large cup setting and the strength of the coffee was perfect for my taste (I prefer stronger coffee).

 My Favorite by a Landslide so Far,5,"I must admit that I have gone a little overboard with my k-cup sampling. So far I must have tried about 50 different blends. OVerall I must say that the vast majority of them have been pleasant, better than what I used to make in my coffee brewer. Then I tried the Donut Shop brand. When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee. Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about. When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing. Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe. My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day. Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one. It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite. I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it.

 Intriguing Grain,5,"I finally bought this Quinoa, and it is really good. It is versatile; depending on how you season it depends on how it turns out. For example, it can be seasoned with lemon, pepper, garlic, basil, etc. It can also be seasoned with brown sugar. I am not going to write a long review; the grain itself is versatile enough to make it just about any way you want. And it's easy to prepare. And it's healthful (I'll get into that in the next paragraph). From what I'd heard about the grain, it is ""old"", ""strong"", ""healthy, ""wise"" (even has built up a coating that is a resistance to insects). This grain intrigues me; I plan to look up its history. Quinoa (which I recently found out) is what dieticians call a ""complete protein"". Other than meat products, there aren't a lot of ""complete proteins"" that I know of, other than soy. I do not eat soy.

 A Ball That Is Super,5,"It's a rubber ball, and it's, uh, super. What kid doesn't enjoy a superball, right? My son really digs this toy, especially in the elementary school gym after basketball practice when he can throw it as hard as he wants in any direction, and the ball literally just goes nuts. This is a great environment for this toy...a racquetball court would be great, too...no, jai-alai would be the best! But I digress. Yes, Dad likes playing with it, too. Go figure. My only complaint is that it's not that big, rather disappointingly small. It's only a little bit bigger than the cheapo superballs you get out of the grocery store coin machines. It's a little bit smaller than a squash ball, definitely smaller than a racquetball. My adult take on this toy is that one the size of a racquetball, or just slightly smaller than a baseball would be the best. The downside of this is, and I can see the Wham-O liability lawyers toiling over the risk analysis, is that given this ball's density, a bigger ball would be a lot more massive, heavy, and could do some real damage to property and person if either were to be, ah, forcefully contacted. Bottom line: This is a classic toy, as basic as you can get, and it does not disappoint.

 Yum!,5,"I was on the fence about buying these for months. I read the reviews and were impressed by them but, the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips I hated made me nervous. This was my first food order from Superstore and I am glad I picked this product to be. I absolutely love these chips. I deiced on the variety pack to start with in case I didn't like one flavor had others I could eat. Turns out though I enjoy them all. They are thicker than your normal potato chip with a great crunch and more of an airy texture. One bag fills me up as a mid-day snack. The flavors themselves are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip. For me this was a good thing. I would have to say the bbq is my favorite. The flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it, the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end. My bags had very few broken chips in them. Everything about this order was great. My father was around when I was trying my first bag, making fun of them cause they were healthy. I offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect. He looked at me confused once he ate it, promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it. This is a man who HATES anything healthy, but shows how good the flavors are. I will definitely be buying these again. …",165 out of 168 users found this review helpful
