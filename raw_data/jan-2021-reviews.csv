 Apfelsaftschorle for Americans,4,"Living in Germany for several years, I acquired a taste for Apfelsaftschorle or schorle for short, apple juice and sparkling water. The soda water cuts the sweetness, gives the juice a little tang, and makes the drink a better hydrator; the juice makes the soda water a little more interesting. I usually drink any fruit juice this way now. Switch premakes my schorle. The blend was and orange citrus rather than apple, but very good regardless. I tried it straight, but it would have been better over ice or if it had been mixed with a little more soda water and a little less juice. The ingredients were juice, sparkling water, and a couple of stabilizers, without two of my pet peeves; artificial color, especially red 40, and high fructose corn syrup. I enjoyed it and can recommend it as an excellent alternative to conventional soda. E. M. Van Court …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 WARNING RECIPE CHANGED AS OF FEBRUARY 2012,1,"My daughter absolutely used to love the original version of the Chick Chick baby food (with Chicken, Sweet Potatoes, and Brown Rice). Unfortunately, the recipe has apparently just been updated (though not reflected on Superstore's page as of 2/24/2012) to include totally different ingredients (except for the chicken). Now my daughter absolutely refuses to eat this product. The consistency and flavor seem to have drastically changed. Hopefully your child will enjoy the new blend, but I wanted to provide a warning for those of you that may have tried the other version... …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
" As a Red Bull Enthusiast, I Highly Recommend This!",5,"This is an excellent, cost-effective alternative to Red Bull. The flavor is spot on--even though a purist may be able to notice the difference, I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal! For the price, two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this. Also, with this syrup, you have the option to how strong or weak you'd like to make each serving. I find that I can add less than the recommended amount and make this mix go even further. I think you would be hard-pressed to find a cheaper alternative that tastes so close to the original. …",32 out of 34 users found this review helpful

 Buyer beware,1,"I ordered this item, and was instead shipped a different item (ginger beer). There is a difference, and the company that makes this makes both. However, Superstore's warehouses are too stupid to recognize the difference. When I politely pointed out to them that they had shipped me the wrong item, they very politely apologized, and promised to send me the right item...whereupon they sent me exactly the same wrong item again. When I complained again, and asked them to either find the right item, or refund my money, they ignored me. If you really want ginger ale, you can buy this mix on the Internet from other suppliers. Don't say I didn't warn you. …",3 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!,5,"I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy. The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes. My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical. Obviously, my experience made me a believer! I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.

 Totally too expensive,1,"This review isn't for oats in general but in this particular posting for them. The price on this is outrageous. While there is no difference in oats in general (Quaker is just the same as any store brand) I understand if one must have Quaker; however, this is not the venue in which to do it. These oats are so overpriced as to be offensive. The same size box sells for $7 at Sam's. As one poster recommended, you would be better off buying them at the supermarket than on here.

 Chemical supplements should be taken based on the advice of a qualified health care provider,2,"As I have problems with sleep at night and tried all sorts of things which are most commonly recommended to improve it, I tought I try this well rated product. I tried it in all the various recommended dosages. But it didn't make the slightest difference for me. Thus I guess that it probably only works if the cause of the unrest is a magnesium deficiency. Reportedly: ""With supplements, overdose is possible, however, particularly in people with poor renal function; occasionally, with use of high cathartic doses of magnesium salts, severe hypermagnesemia has been reported to occur even without renal dysfunction"". ""Safety Issues The US government has set the following upper limits for use of magnesium supplements: Children 1-3 years: 65 mg 4-8 years: 110 mg Adults: 350 mg Pregnant or Nursing Women: 350 mg"" ""It has been called nature's calcium channel blocker."" ""Magnesium assists in calcium uptake, but it also competes with dietary calcium for the same absorption site in the intestine. Excessive dietary calcium (or phosphorus) is much more likely to block magnesium absorption than vice- versa in the typical American diet. Magnesium absorption is also inhibited by excessive dietary fat, phosphate, lactose, phytates and oxalates which form insoluble compounds with magnesium. Magnesium is also lost in diarrhea, long term use of diuretics, excessive sugar intake and protein malnutrition... ... there are lower levels of minerals in food today due to depletion of the soil in modern farming methods. (23) Modern methods of milling, processing and the preservation of food cause nutrient losses, eg 85% of magnesium is removed from whole wheat in the milling."" Thus it is advisable to consult a qualified health care provider if a deficiency is suspected.

 Great product for busy people,5,"Quinoa is a relatively new grain to the North American market, but it's an ancient staple in South America. And I'm really glad it's finally gotten popular, because it is an INCREDIBLE source of vegetable protein -- there are six grams of protein in each of these meal-size servings. It has a mild taste, just as rice does. It's a natural grain, and can be the equivalent of rice or potatoes in a traditional meal. But, there's so much more you can do with it! I've scrambled it into eggs, to provide more protein and volume. I've added it to soups, I've just heated it, thrown in blueberries, and had it with a little hazelnut milk as a breakfast cereal. I've had it warmed for lunch with a little salsa and avocado on it. I've added it to recipes for breads, muffins, health bars. I've used it to thicken casseroles, it's just a great, all-purpose pantry item. And, it's organic, and fully prepared. I like to mix a pack of this quinoa, with a pack of the McDougall's Lentil Curry that Superstore also carries -- and then I spoon that mix into romaine lettuce leaves, with a dollop of salsa, to make great tasting lettuce wraps for a fun frisky lunch. This ready-to-serve organic quinoa gets five stars and two thumbs up from me. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Not bad but not Jasper proof,4,"This toy is great for preventing my dog from inhaling all his food. Unfortunately it takes him less than an hour to empty it, so it's doesn't keep him as occupied as long as I'd like. So far minimal/suspected wear (bottle is scratched up and some of the nibs of the rubber chew part are gone) and I'm waiting to see if he manages to untie the knot of the rope (like he has on another toy). Update 6/30/07: The screw on part has suffered some damage. It's almost as if Jasper bit it while it the toy was intact, nearly breaking a chunk out of it. Looks like I'm gonna have to buy another or find another toy. (So if I could I'd drop my rating to 3 stars.) Update 12/30/07: Now the rope is ""unraveling"" near the top knot and it's getting stuck in the opening, making it hard for even me to get the rope out enough to dislodge the food. So it's definitely time for a new toy to dispense Jasper's food, which could very likely be this one simply for the ease of loading the food. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Are they SERIOUS??,1,"GoSicknic! Just because I can't eat gluten, doesn't mean I want to eat garbage. This ""meal"" (and I use the term loosely) is nothing but processed, sodium-ridden, chemically-laden junk in a box! I have to hand it to the marketers who created this line -- they have been so slick, this line of food trash has infiltrated the health food sections of grocery stores everywhere. Besides being somewhat bizarre in components, this ""meal"" is packed with highly-allergenic items such as cheese spread, a piece of nut candy, sulfur dioxide, sodium nitrites, BHA and BHT! I mean, the gluten-free crackers are a real head-scratcher ... might as well have put Ritz in there. Obviously whoever put this trippy repast together is not familiar with food allergies. I suspect the crackers are a red herring to put the shopper off the trail of the anaphylactic shock value of the rest of the box. It should come with a free albuterol inhaler and an Epipen. Maybe the Epipen could have cartoon characters on it to appeal more to the kids. Frankly, this whole line of ""meals"" has the haphazard feel of a harried, not-too-bright mother hastily throwing a bunch of randomly-chosen, non-perishable ""food"" items in a box because her kid is late for the school bus and she forgot to go to the grocery store. Please. You'd be better off eating the cardboard this ""meal"" came in!

I am *MORE* than ready. …",0 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Sesame Snaps From Heaven,5,"When I first tried these confections many years ago (in the early 90's) I instantly loved them. They are toasted sesame seeds bound together with a honey glazing. That is all - honey and sesame seeds. But boy are they good and addictive. The only negative side to this treat is that the four individual wafers contained in each package tend to stick together and sometimes they do not break away cleanly from each other. This is to be expected though given the nature of the ingredients and is a small inconvenience. The product is made in, of all places, Poland and I find it gratifying to be able to purchase a product from a country that has come so far, economically and socially, in the last 20 years. If you want a simple, delicious, and nutritious confection, look no further - this is it. …",30 out of 38 users found this review helpful

 Dry and boring,1,"There needs to be a choice for ZERO stars. While the pictures are nice, and their website (www amazingclubs com) specifically bolds the statement that they have the ""freshest and most mouth-watering desserts"" it is the complete opposite. The first month we received dry brownies that were slightly smashed and crumbling. The second month was a small dry marble bundt cake (no way would it serve 8-12 even if you wanted to) and just now received white chocolate chip cookies that were (you guessed it) dry. Hard to believe that they are getting away with selling a dozen or so average-at-best brownies and a few more cookies for $28 a pop. This is a great racket for them, but hopefully I can post this review in enough places that they won't take anymore people in. Definitely NOT gourmet - do not order this. …",29 out of 30 users found this review helpful
 stays potent for years,5,"I've been using SAF yeast for 15 years. I keep the unopened pouches in the freezer. When I open a pouch, I pour it onto a pint-sized plastic jar to keep in the refrigerator. I use the plastic jar to refill a smaller jar, from which I get yeast when I make dough. That way, I don't have to open the larger jar often. It may sit in the refrigerator four years before I finish it.

 prefer coffee filter set without the screw top,3,"Ever since I came back from Vietnam, I have been using these small ""French presses"", or Vietnamese coffee filter sets. I bought 3 sets for one dollar (15,000 dong) in Vietnam, and soon realized that I needed more. So, I bought a few in the U.S. (local VN grocery store) and noticed that they come in different forms. This one has the screw in press, which I don't like as much as the simple press down piece that just sits on top of the ground coffee. It works great. The screw in needs to be tighten until you hit the coffee, but don't tighten too much (low drip, or no drip) and too little (too fast), but just right. I can't figure it out. It is much more difficult to remove the screw part after the coffee is done. Worse, sometimes it can be that it is screwed in too hard, so the water does not drain through, but now you can't loosen it, because the hot water covers the piece. That's why the simpler version works much better. I have never seen this construction in Vietnam either. However, there is one advantage, it is that it is sturdier and lasts longer. …",32 out of 32 users found this review helpful

 The healtiest oil you can use,5,"If you research, organic, unrefined cold pressed extra virgin coconut oil, you will see that it is a medium chain triglyceride. This means that it goes straight to the liver to be stored for energy. It doesn't go into the bloodstream, where it can break off & deposit in the arteries in the form of plaque. Coconut oil is a clear liquid at 76 degrees. Your body, being 98.6, keeps it in a clear liquid state, so it cannot solidify in the body as butters or margarines do. Coconut and avocado oils are healthy fats that have been maligned for years. This is a con game just to get more people on to cholesterol lowering drugs. It's subtle coconut flavor and high smoking point make it very useful in cooking and baking. Olive oil now only gets used for quick sauteing and salads. Butter now gets used very sparingly as well. We use mashed avocado or coconut oil in baked potato instead of globs of butter. My husband uses it on his hair and skin as a moisturizer. My only disapointment is that Nutiva does not use Glass jars instead of plastic. Give your body a break and try Nutiva coconut oil. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
" Some beef flavor, tons of salt",2,"Since Superstore didn't post the nutritional value of this product, here it is, straight from the back of the label: Serving size - one teaspoon (6 gm): Calories - 10 Total fat - 0.5 gm Sodium - 710 mg Total carbohydrate - 1 gm Protein - 1 gm The numbers do not begin to give you an idea of just how salty this stuff is! If you put a small sample in your mouth, you can feel and taste the individual salt grains. I looked on the back of a can of Morton salt - 1.5 gm of Morton iodized salt has 590 mg of Sodium, which comes down to 393.33 mg of Sodium per 1 gm of table salt. Which means that this ""Better than Bouillon"" Beef flavor has 1.8 gm of table salt per 6 gm (teaspoon) serving size, which means that SALT is the single largest ingredient in this product.

 Just doesnt make enough to do anything,3,"I'm not happy with the yield of this product. I mainly wanted it for the cilantro, and after 8 weeks not enough cilantro to even make a small portion of salsa. The basil grows very fast and overcrowds the other plants. The mint and parsley don't look very healthy. I used bottled, filtered water and always had correct light times. They will NOT grow as full as the picture and never that evenly unless you wait 4-5 weeks to plant all else but the basil. About the only thing I have enjoyed so far was breaking off a leaf or two of each plant, mainly the basil, and chewing it. VERY remarkable how fresh it is (Well, its still alive when I was chewing it). Tastes great! Just not worth the money. If it were 75% cheaper, would be a fantastic product. Note: I bought my own seeds after reading on their website that I can use them with their self-seed kit. Well, they dont sell the self-seed kit. I wanted to plant cilantro, catnip, and stevia.

 Over Hyped Bottled Water,2,"The bottle says, ""A Difference You Can Taste."" For me that would not be a good thing. I don't want my water to taste like anything. Fortunately, this water disappointed...it tastes like, well, water. Now comes the problem. Essentia's Web site is full of hype, but what it comes down to is this: Essentia is filtered city water, just like Aquafina or Dasani...using essentially the same methods. I suspect the raise in pH is from the second ingredient, sodium bicarbonate, aka baking soda. I compared the water test results provided by Essentia on their Web site and those of my local water authority. Essentia says, ""Electrolytes are dissolved minerals in the body that conduct electricity, such as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium. We add trace amounts of those same elements in a formula that complements the body's naturally occurring mix and concentration."" They must be really trace amounts. Reading their water test report, neither calcium or potassium are listed, and only .68 mg/l of magnesium. The sodium level is about the same as in my tap water. Certainly not the electrolyte levels of Gatorade. I can find nothing in my research that indicates a pH of 9.5 is anything special. Bottom Line: I'm not impressed. I often buy bottled water instead of soft drinks when traveling.

" What would I have done without you, Health Energy Potion?",5,"There I was, face to face with the fabled Gorlok monster with only 10 HP left.

I could smell the stench of death as his long talons narrowly missed my already tattered left arm while quickly I rolled to the side. As the Gorlok was recovering from his voracious strike I slipped out my Health Energy Potion and downed it in a single, hurried gulp. I could feel my strength being restored and much to my amazement my arm was fully healed! Those magnificent bastards at Energy Drinks have done it again!

In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store. I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie. In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion. Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me. This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber. While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar. Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Great variety means no picky eaters!,4,"We discovered Earth's Best when my oldest started solids years ago. They had a more limited selection then, but offered more variety than the ""regular"" brands. For him, we only bought a few jars each trip, those flavors that we couldn't get in another brand. For our second child, we added a few more. With the 3rd baby, we started out on the larger brands, but he wouldn't eat them. Who can blame him!? They're runny and lacking any flavor. Not to mention, no matter how good sweet potatoes are, how many jars can you eat? He gobbles up every jar of Earth's Best without any problems. When we introduce a new flavor, he's all for it. I agree with other posts that some of the flavors are very runny. We just add a few tsp. of cereal and problem solved. Earth's Best is more expensive. I calculated that every 2 weeks of food costs me $15 more than buying the other brands. However, we decided that since he eats it all (vs. being very picky with other brands) it's a wash. If you want to use Earth's Best for your baby w/out breaking the bank, try these tips: *Visit Earth's Best's website and print off all the coupons they'll allow (usually 3), have family and friends do the same *Buy at Whole Foods.

 You should try this even though it may not strike your fancy:  It's very good.,5,"I've come back to tea after drinking coffee almost exclusively since before adulthood. A huge part of the migration was, initially, due to that malady of modern life, acid reflux. Caffeine makes me gullet go gaga. In fact, I'm even reduced to drinking a blend of decaf and regular tea in order to keep the oesophagus happy. A really cool thing about tea is that, unlike coffee, in its varieties there is a complexity of subtle (and not so subtle) flavors that one can easily apprehend. Sure, there are people who will argue there is a whole range of flavor notes that can be found amongst the various coffee beans and while this is, strictly speaking, true, it is also pretty much true that one cup of good coffee smells and tastes pretty much the same as any other cup of good coffee. Coffee is not the sort of thing one sips to enjoy as one would a glass of wine. Drinking tea, on the other hand, can very much become a sipping game possibly because a tea leaf is more like an herb or flower than a coffee bean is. This is not to say that one can't find plenty of industrial strength tea with minimal flavor notes (e.g. many of the English/Scottish Breakfast tea blends, but see also Taylors robust yet flavorful S.A. Kwazulu that manages to deliver a mule's kick) and I love that kind of stuff and wish I could drink it because the decaffeinated stuff I've been reduced to is insipid in comparison. If you are just getting into drinking it, you're soon going to be touring the world of tea for different taste sensations, and likely flit from leaf to leaf before you find what makes for you the perfect brew. This is DEFINITELY one of those teas you want to try on that journey for this Special Rare Assam Leaf Tea, Doomur Dulling, Loose Leaf tea is actually pretty special. When you open the sealed bag it comes packed in you will likely first be surprised by the large size of the tips that comprise this tea. They are so large the contents have the look of a pouch of tobacco (indeed, the stuff is nearly as fragrant as a pouch of newly opened pipe tobacco). The next thing you'll do is smell them, no doubt, and note the fragrant, not quite heady aroma it exudes. This fragrance and consequent flavor is what makes this tea singular. After you have brewed it, stir in some sugar and milk, then taste it. You'll immediately identify this as the so-called 'milk tea' drinks that the Japanese are so fond of and drink as a soft drink in much the same way that Americans in the South drink iced tea. Its flavor is distinctive floral notes and may take you by surprise. Doubtless, these floral notes and the delicacy of the liquor are what make this tea so desirable And may put off those who prefer the more common industrial strength blends. I find that I quite like this tea, and could possibly make it a daily drinker because it doesn't seem to cause that acid reflux reaction the broth-like teas I enjoy so much do. Having said that, the pronounced fruit or floral flavor of the brew tells me that it may be something I drink for a can or two before reverting to the hearty (however feeble the decaffeinated version of the hearty is) brews I generally enjoy. Actually, the English Breakfast Tea produced by 'Ahmad Tea' is one I highly recommend as a most delicious, full-floral-note flavored tea that brews up a hearty liquor. It's the closest thing yet I've found that balances well industrial strength and high fashion flavor. As for this tea, it is all high fashion flavor and, while I can't say that I love it, tastes real good. …",15 out of 22 users found this review helpful

 Bad,1,"I was attracted to this box of cookies because of the ""brand"". ""Late July"" sounds like a wonderful brand name, and late July does bring back wonderful memories for me: it sounds like a fish fry with homemade french-fried potatoes and cole slaw and hush puppies, an ice bucket, iced tea, a cool breeze blowing from the fan, a porch, and lots of love. That's what I thought of when I saw this brand. Also, it is natural and therefore, vegans can have this product. Vanilla bean with green tea: The cookies didn't taste good. The flavor idea was pretty good. There was a hint of good flavor. Vanilla bean with green tea sounds wonderful. Possibly, the bad taste was due to all the soy and soy products used. I managed to eat this whole box (of vanilla bean with green tea) without throwing any out. Dark chocolate: Horrible. I couldn't even finish the whole box; I had to throw out most of it. (And I'm the queen of conservativeness.) The ""dark"" chocolate was so dark and so horrible, that it was too much for even a chocolate lover. The chocolate had a horrible taste.

 YES! Popchips Nacho Cheese Tortilla!,5,"In the pre-Popchips days Doritos were one of my favorite chips... I eat chips every day with lunch, now I only eat Popchips. I love the taste and the fact they're much lower in fat than ""regular"" chips. I eat the 3 ounce potato Popchips bags and now the 3.5 ounce Tortilla bags. These 3.5 oz bags seem to be just slightly less volume than the 3 oz potato bags but both are a satisfying amount. The nutritional values for the Tortilla bags are pretty much the same as the potato (not exact but close). So that said when I saw these brand new tortilla Popchips on Superstore I got excited! Excited over chips? Yes. I immediately ordered a box of the Nacho Cheese with subscription. Today they finally arrived and just in time for lunch. They nailed it! They look like any tortilla chip but a bit more puffy. They are crunchy but slightly more ""fluffy"" I guess you could say than a regular tortilla chip.

 A Must Have for the Foodies Spice Cabinet,5,"When I first received my order of the Italian Dressing mix, I was a little wary. A lot of prepared herb and spice mixes on the market seem to be full chemicals that I can't pronounce and they taste very dull, extremely salty and have a strange, artificial after-taste. NOT THIS ONE! When my order arrived the first thing that I did was to taste the mixture straight out of the jar. I was surprised at how clean and fresh the taste was. I picked up on the herbs (I'm thinking oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary and maybe some mint), the sea salt and then the sweetness of the bell pepper combined with a tartness of the lemon juice. There was a slight bit of heat (the garlic?) and a nice, pure, food-like aftertaste. Next I mixed it with some fine olive oil and used it as a dip for some crusty Italian bread. Wonderful! Later in the week I used it, along with some Dijon Mustard, as a coating for a rack of lamb. I ended up adding a little crushed black pepper to the mix and it was great. Finally I used it as a salad dressing along with aged balsamic vinegar, wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. It took a few minutes to get the proportions right, and I did add a little chopped rosemary and some fresh minced garlic. It was much better than any prepared dressing that comes in a bottle. I was really impressed with the flavor and quality of this prepared mix, so much so that I ordered this variety pack. Here are my thoughts on the other two varieties that come with this set: * French Garden At first taste it seemed salter than the Italian version. The chives not only tasted fresh but still retained their classic oval shape (meaning that they were not over-processed or ground to death). The garlic and onions were strong, but not too. I also picked up on the parsley and I thought I tasted a little tarragon. I added this mix to a French style omelet (runny). Very nice! My fear of it being too salty was put to rest. I next sprinkled it on some grilled eggplant and I was blown away! It woke up the subtle flavors of the vegetable. I will be trying this is other dishes to be sure. * Napa Garden This mix had a different texture than the others, probably due to the tomato powder which added a wonderful richness to the blend. This one was not as salty as the other two. The pepper gave it a little heat but I usually like more (which is easy to add, hard to take out). I tried this (along with some olive oil) with spinach angel-hair pasta. That turn out to be a good choice. The mix did not overwhelm the flavor of the pasta but added that extra kick. I highly recommend this variety pack. All three will become staples in my spice cabinet. …",27 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 Not Your Fathers Powdered Eggs,5,"Most people that buy powdered eggs tend to use them in recipes as a replacement for real eggs. My introduction to instant eggs was not so indiscreet. I first tasted them on a camping trip with my sons scout troop quite a few years ago. It was late spring and getting warmer so we were concerned about bringing real eggs along. We had the ""Honeyville"" brand that is available here on Superstore as well. I found them to be surprisingly good scrambled. In fact when done right they seemed indiscernible to me in respect to real eggs. Same texture and flavor. I decided to buy more powered eggs years later when I started to do more numerous hikes that took me further out into the wilderness, and I found myself missing the taste of eggs over an open fire. Being the frugal gourmet that I am I opted to try the Barry Farm egg powder over the Honeyville for it was a bit cheaper. Not only that, but I already owned and have used Barry Farms chicken and beef bouillon powder for quite some time and found them both to be excellent in soups and stews. I am pleased to announce that my being a tightwad this time around was very well placed, and rewarded. The Barry farm egg powder taste very good when prepared right. I make them here at home as scrambled quite often. And as a recipe substitute I find they are undetectable as to be compared to real eggs. They are most definitely just as good as the Honeyville brand. (Although in all fairness, I have noticed lately that Barry Farm is just about the same price now as the Honeyville. I still prefer the taste of Barry Farm). The only suggestion I would make to anyone that wishes to be adventurous and make scrambled eggs with this powder is make sure you grease the pan well. They stick something awful if you don't, just like real eggs. There will always be a core amount of folks that would never attempt cooking or tasting powdered eggs either scrambled or in a recipe. For those that fit into that category don't bother to get adventurous now. For those of you that have tasted these before, or are tempted to taste them now, I highly recommend Barry Farm egg powder. They're nowhere near as bad, or the same powdered eggs soldiers used to tell horror stories about when talking about the cuisine of their war years... …",76 out of 77 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",18 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 The world's best cold remedy.,5,"The product description calls the Orangettes ""Belgian Vitamin C."" Except for the luxury price, I'm sure Belgians must be pretty healthy with these around. They're amazing! The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular, but Leonidas does it very well. The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet). Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion. The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying. I don't know if these guys are really going to improve your health, but they will definitely improve your day. In my opinion, they're worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one-time try. The packaging is a gold box, wrapped in blue and white Leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box.

In small print the word DEXTROSE. What is Dextrose? Is a HIGH Glycemic Index, fast absorbing carbohydrate derived from corn. Percentage of Corn - Genetically Modified. And how about the HIGH GLYCEMIC INDEX, not good for diabetics. Definately not purchasing this again. Also from what've read Truvia is no better - alcohol sugars. Guess back to the drawing board.

 OK cup of coffee,3,"The Gevalia T DISC is very weak compared to home brewing Gevalia ground coffee. Believe it or not the Maxwell House T DISC is actually better, makes a more robust cup of coffee. All the other T DISCs are fabulous - the espresso is just about as good as you would get from a commercial coffee shop. Hot Chocolate is delicious. Hopefully they will re-vamp the Gevalia Signature Blend to make it a better, stronger, more robust cup of coffee like their traditional ground blend. …",22 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 The best kept secret for the best spaghetti sauce,5,"Spatini used to be available to the average American in little packets sold in boxes of three at the supermarket. Unfortunately, the company making Spatini was bought by the evil conglomerate Unilever, which dropped consumer Spatini in favor of their 2 Lawry's (inferior) spaghetti sauce mixes. For some secret reason, though, Spatini has remained available in these 'restaurant' sized packages and that's a good thing! Buy it like there's no tomorrow because Unilever is not to be trusted. 3 tbsp are approximately equivalent to 1 packet of the old product. In response to the other reviewer, add a little sugar or agave to desalinate the taste of the current product and to decrease the acidity of the tomatoes. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Good if you don't want to just get the stuff on your own for a lot less...,3,"It's an ok set if you don't want to go out and buy these very basic ingredients and two simple tools (bamboo mat and wooden spatula) on your own for a lot less. This REALLY SHOULD INCLUDE A SMALL JAR OF TOASTED SESEME SEEDS for the money you are paying but doesn't! But it does get you started and will allow you to make some basic sushi. Like other people have said the cookbook included is just terrible!! It talks about toasting the nori even though the package of nori already says ""toasted nori""! The cookbook is just terrible. In trying to follow it to the letter for making the rice I burned the hell out of it! But you learn what you realy need to do quickly. Bottom line the cookbook included is about the worst cookbook ever written, the ""kit"" could be gotten for half as much or less, and it should have included sesame seeds.. Still a decent gift and will get you started. …",29 out of 30 users found this review helpful

 My cat loves them and the seller was great,5,"I was worried that my cat would not like these and was hesitant to buy this many. I purchased a smaller bag and my cat LOVES them. So I purchased this much larger bag at Superstore's much better price via Superstore from Entirely Pets. Again, I was worried about the seller based on other comments. But they were ordered on Sunday, and I got them Tuesday morning - they ship from Fremont, CA. The expiration date on the bag is 16 months from now, about what I would get in any retail store. So I've just not experienced any problems with this seller or this product. The manufacturer admits that brushing your cat's teeth is much better, and I do that about every other day. This product ensures that there is at least something done for his teeth every day. And trust me, my cat does not let me forget to give him one of these every night. He'll claw at my legs until I do and his claws are sharp! By the way, one tip for cat owners: many of an older cat's problems are due to the propensity of most cats not to drink enough water: kidney and teeth problems are common. I feed my cat only a teaspoon of wet food a day, smothered in about 2 ounces of water. He drinks the wet-food-flavored water and only then gets to eat the wet food. My cat is 19 years old (the average cat lives to be about 12-14 years old) and has had no major health problems. However, the teeth cleanings are getting to be too stressful for him, so I've taken to these treats and brushing his teeth to try to spread out the cleanings. …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Research Product before Purchasing - Debilitating Side Effects!!,1,"People taking this product should be well aware of its side effects. This product left me with horrible dizziness that lasted well over 72 hours. I also had the worst headache of my life while consuming this coffee. I consider myself a healthy young man, I workout 4 times a week, run and live a pretty athletic lifestyle. This product literally had me down for the count from my normal activities for about one week. Before taking this product please consult your physician and discuss the potential side effects as it relates to your current health. While reviewing any changes to my diet or reactions to any medications, the only change was adding this product to my diet. Once I eliminated this coffee from my diet, the headaches and dizziness subsided. However, the product still remains in your system for quite some time as I still experience slight bouts of dizziness during the first few minutes of my day. …",13 out of 21 users found this review helpful

I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two. At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful.

" ""Arazona Vanilla"" is  ""Halaleveryday""",2,The Mexican beans that I ordered from Arizona Vanilla Co. came from a company called Halal Everyday.

" These are good.  Very, very good.",5,"I don't mean ""good for a gluten free cookie"", or ""almost like a normal cookie"". No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good. No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells. No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture. They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free. No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also. According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well. That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff. You're probably wondering what the catch is, right? It definitely isn't the taste. As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good. I only see two drawbacks. 1) Cost. Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected. 2) Quantity. The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies. 16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them. However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us. I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag. Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating. Even so, I still wish there were more in a package. One last note, just because I found it to be unusual. Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight. These aren't. Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others. There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space. It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Excellent basic espresso,5,"While there are lots of small coffee roasters whose espressos I enjoy, this is truly a good basic everyday espresso. Espressos should be dark and full bodied. This one is rich and flavorful. It makes a nice crema. It is also good for using in a countertop espresso machine. We have a Jura Capressa E8 Super Automatic. A lot of the flavored coffees and roasts that are too dark gum up the system and make it sluggish. And while it is not a big deal to change the grinder, it is probably better to use a bean the machine likes. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Buyer Beware,1,"Like the other 1-star buyer, this powder was shipped to me in a ULINE static shield bag which indicates that it is ""ROHS Compliant."" ROHS compliancy means that certain metals are banned from being used in packaging, but not necessarily lead! There is no indication this bag was not used previously for electronics, there is no origin marking anywhere on the bag and there is no nutrition label. There also is no ""organic"" label on the bag aside from a shoddily printed sticker that says ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Because of all of this I can not be sure this product is not adulterated, let alone organic. I will not purchase this product again from this seller and suggest that other buyers beware. The product itself may be fine, but why take a chance (especially if you are looking for what is supposed to be an 'organic' product free of contaminants)? UPDATE 4/12/12: I complained about the improper packaging and submitted photo evidence of the static shield bags to both the seller and Superstore. Originally the seller claimed the product was shipped in food-grade ULINE bags, but after I sent photo evidence to the contrary I heard nothing further from the seller. Superstore granted me a full refund today. If you do order this product, I recommend you double-check that the packaging is safe before opening it! …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

And, when I tried to chew it, my tooth broke in half. OUCH! Sorry, but no cereal should break your tooth, ever!

 good seaweed but somewhat messy to eat,4,"If you like dried seaweed, you will probably like this. Food is highly subjective, so I'll limit this review to things that might not be obvious from the item description. It is slightly sweet (about the same as barbeque potato chips) and has sesame seeds mixed in. The packages contain shredded seaweed strips which are similar in size to cross-cut shredded paper; this should not be problematic to eat at home but if you want something to snack on while driving, traveling, etc., I would recommend the salty (no sugar) version which comes in 3inx1.5in sheets. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 Two Paws Up!,5,"My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them. But I needn't have worried, they loved it! The Tuna Too Cool is a rich-looking, reddish pate with lots of jelly on top and my twosome were wolfing their portions down and got into a bit of a scuffle over the last couple of mouthfuls. They have no higher praise. …",24 out of 25 users found this review helpful

So far I've ordered the following products: 1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots 2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots The first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jim's, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per zip lock bag. 3) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra Smokeys These are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste. 4) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random size Taste great if you are a jerky lover. 5) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni Short Shots Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots 6) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey Strung O.K. taste.
