 Impressive gas!,5,"This cereal is not only delicious, but it creates the most amazing gas! I walk around for hours literally farting with every step I take! At work, my chair really takes a pounding and the warm odor of high-fiber farts lingers most of the morning, making my irksome coworkers more reluctant to bother me. The only down side is that unless you let it soak a long time, it's like trying to eat a bowl of rocks. Warming it in the microwave improves the soaking time and is great for the cold winter months! …",25 out of 28 users found this review helpful
 This filter works PERFECT!,5,"Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the ""old fashion way"" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size. I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Superstore, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry. The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew! …",472 out of 477 users found this review helpful
 The recipe or ingredient quality has changed (?),1,"I am on the board of an animal shelter, and have 23 cats of my own. We were directed to Wellness as an excellent no-grain food. We buy the largest sized cans, and we spend almost $800 per month on this food. The cats used to love all of the flavors we bought (Turkey, Chx, Chx and Beef, Turkey and Salmon) and suddenly NONE of them will eat ANY of them! I can only surmise that something has happened to the recipe, or the quality of the ingredients. It makes no sense. More bizarre, we feed the outdoor (feral) cats the food and many of them won't touch it, either. The hunt is on to find the next ""great food""... …",17 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Good but perhaps too distictive flavor,3,"I bought this after having the fortune of a chance encounter with white truffle oil which I found quite tasty. Also I've had black truffles on french dishes in restaurants of which I also was quite fond. So I looked up various truffle options and decided to give this salt a try. The reviews were lauding this product as being the best thing to the fresh truffle itself .. But alas I was disappointed and really kind of frustrated. Maybe it's 'cause I've had the real thing, but no because the truffle oil is still not an issue. The problem is the strong and distinctive quality of this product which doesn't always enhance but rather changes the flavor of foods I've put it on directly. Unfortunately I haven't always found this change for the better. But it has been OK in soups or stews where the flavor is blended in. Maybe I just got a bad batch or something? I don't know if this sort of thing is like wine where storage conditions can damage it? Anyways I give it 3/5 stars. …",8 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Something's Changed with Canidae food,1,"I fed and recommended this food for several years as one of the best dry foods available. However, over the last few months (late 2007) something has changed. My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it. Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped. I tried another bag last week-- same results. Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months. No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners. Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address. I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems. I've changed my dogs to Eagle Pack Holistic Selects. It's more expensive, but they are back to their old selves-- healthy, no digestive troubles, and great coats. …",15 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 For more than salting foods.,5,"Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron. …",16 out of 18 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Great value and taste,5,"When you go through K-cups like I do, this large quantity purchase is perfect. Hazelnut is always a favorite and this particular brand holds up to a generous cup serving. Some brands get too watered down in a large mug, but this has body enough to take it. Since I store my K-cups in a drawer, it doesn't matter that the shipping box is a bare bones container. I just appreciate the value. All in all, it's a great way to buy K-cups in quantity. Highly recommended. …",49 out of 49 users found this review helpful
 Very disappointed,1,"I recently purchased 5 cases of Wellness cat food and the cans arrived at my home in their securely wrapped cases all dented up. One of my cats is turning her nose up at this food - she pigged-out on this food when I brought it home from the local pet food store. These cans, if they were sitting on a store shelf, would not be purchased and I feel that National Pet Pharmacy is taking advantage of online orders to get rid of canned food that would otherwise not sell. …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!,5,"I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy. The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes. My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical. Obviously, my experience made me a believer! I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands. And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 THESE ARE NOT VEGETARIAN,1,"I saw these gummi bears in the vegetarian section. To my amazement, they should not be here. They contain gelatin which is an animal product and it is not vegetarian. Here is the definition from Wikipedia: Gelatin (spelled gelatine in some Commonwealth countries) is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), nearly tasteless solid substance, derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolysed form of collagen, and is classified as a foodstuff, with E number E441. It is found in some gummy candies as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin dessert, and some low-fat yogurt. Household gelatin comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand. Buyers beware of the ingredients of products you are buying, just because it says it's vegetarian doesn't always mean it is. Look up the ingredients just to be on the safe side. I hope this is helpful. Whoever posted this item as vegetarian needs to do a little more research on what ingredients are considered vegetarian. thank you, …",3 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 Extremely bad longevity,1,"I have owned several of these and given a few away as gifts. I LOVE how well they work when they are brand new so when mine failed I bought new ones assuming I just got a lemon. THEY ARE ALL LEMONS. My observation of several units is that the average service life is from 3 to 6 uses. Sometimes a new probe fixes the problem ($20 ea) sometimes nothing (including hitting the reset button) helps. Look at other product reviews on different web sites; they all complain about how quickly the unit fails. You may also notice that several different brands all look alike with the same screen indicating that they are all the same unit sold under different brand names. With all the bad reviews of these things the firms selling these things should consider the ethics of selling something this expensive that only works a few times. Unfortunately the other brands of remote thermometers, from what I have seen, all seem to fail after only a few uses. This is a real drag because when they work, they work great, and I guess that's why I am so annoyed. …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Beware many reports of toxic effects from Navitas,1,"Confirmed Goji Berry causing severe nausia cramping and intestinal pain. I was introduced to goji berries during the summer as a friend I met had just opened a raw food cafe. His food NEVER (I mean never) gave me any problems it was all delicious and much of it was cacao and goji berries. He has very selective about his sources and does not trust many companies out there.(His Goji comes from Sunfood) When I returned home from Alaska I decided to try more superfoods and bought a trail mix by Navitas that was Goji, Cacao Nibs, and Cashews. That day I had a green shake for breakfast and a banana for a snack then just a pinch of Goji Berries afterwards. Within the hour I was writhing in pain and couldn't imagine what it was. This pain is severe. I wanted to die. It lasted about twelve hours. Including vomiting and diarrhea Next day I had a big green salad for lunch and then feeling better grabbed another SMALL pinch of goji and within 20 minutes I was in the exact same pain. I knew then it was the goji and instantly typed ""goji stomach ache"" into google and found threads verifying it. I called my friend and told him about my reaction and he asked me if it was Navitas. I didn't recall and didn't have the bag on me but he said he bet 100% it was them. He had similar reaction to their product and did hydrogen peroxide tests and found them to be rancid. Got home and verified his assertion. Again, I never had this problem before eating Goji from Sunfood, but this Navitas is killing me. BEWARE: Detox can be painful enough even on a quality Goji berry. You should start with very small amounts and I would recommend trying alternate brands NOT navitas. …",17 out of 36 users found this review helpful
 Mmm. Chocolate!,5,"I ordered this on January 8th. After nearly 2 weeks without receiving the product, I went online to see what the hold up was. It said delivery will be around Feb 9th.

 Mix is fine; challenge is the prep and the frying,5,"After several dismal failures using a pot on the stove, I finally had great success after firing up the big turkey fryer kettle/propane burner in the driveway, using about 8 inches of peanut oil. Taking advice of others - refrigerate the dough for several hours, and then make sure you roll out the dough to EXACTLY 1/8th inch thickness like the instructions say, about the same as a piece of corrugated cardboard - no thinner (don't puff up and turn out like cookies) and no thicker (too heavy, flat and thick - like they serve at the Cafe Beignet and some other places). I started test frying them at 320-340 degrees, but finally got the best result at higher temperature of 380-400. First time I've ever had them puff up perfectly like at Cafe du Monde, light and fluffy like little pillows with one inch vertical rise. Good luck. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Mild Daily Energy Tonic,4,"**** This Goji Berry Green Tea from Yogi Tea is a daily energy tonic. It's an all natural tea made from organic green tea leaf, natural and organic flavors, organic green matcha tea leaf, and goji berries (lyceum barbarum). The taste is mild, only very slightly berry-like, tasting mostly of green tea, with a very pleasant aroma; in fact, it's so mild, that I would definitely use two tea bags and brew it for the full six minutes. It does not get bitter. Unless you enjoy very mild tea, you should plan on getting fewer cups of tea from the box. For this reason I gave this tea only four stars. I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Goji Berry Green Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Green Tea Goji Berry is an uplifting daily tonic that promotes energy and revitalization with a fragrant blend of Organic Green Tea, Organic Japanese Green Matcha Tea and Goji Berry. For centuries, the peoples of the Far East have treasured Green Tea as a delicious and energizing tonic. A recent study in the American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology (2005) suggests that long-term consumption of Green Tea might provide increased endurance while exercising. Green Tea is also celebrated for its antioxidant properties, which may help promote longevity. This formula also contains Organic Japanese Green Matcha Tea, a powdered form of green tea that provides a burst of energy and delicate flavor. The bright red Goji Berry has been consumed for centuries in the East, and is considered one of the most healing fruits in Traditional Chinese Medicine. This treasured fruit helps convert food into energy, protect the liver from damaging toxins and provides a boost to both the immune and circulation systems. Find yourself on the path to a revitalized life with the invigorating qualities of Green Tea Goji Berry."" There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Goji Berry Green Tea contains approximately 52 mg of caffeine per tea bag, which is a bit over half of what is normally found in an 8 oz cup of coffee. It's a pretty strong green tea, with a good portion of the energizing effect coming from caffeine. I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting.

" These are awesome, fatty, and flavorful.",4,"These little pretzel pieces are totally addictive, which is probably not a good thing because they're a lot worse for you than you'd think pretzels should be. They have around 60 fat calories and 3 grams of saturated fat in ONE ounce, which equals out to be 15% of your daily sat fat intake per serving (one ounce). The reason they're so good AND so fatty is that the mustard/onion seasoning is in an oil that permeates through the shell of the pretzel, making them extra flavorful and not dry at all. They're a little sweet, have good mustard flavor, and the onion flavor even comes through a little (they taste like they're supposed to). I try to just grab a handful at snack time and quit while I'm ahead, but I usually end up going back for more later. If you're willing to put up with a little extra fat for a lot of extra flavor, these are a perfect snack. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful
" Can't find Senseo coffee, here's the story",5,"Years ago Philips and Douwe Egberts were partners in the development of the machine and coffee pods. The copyright on the pod system was ruled invalid and a decision was made to offer the pods via on line vendors only; no more brick and mortar stores. Philips then sold their share of the coffee business to Douwe Egberts and are moving pod production to Brazil. This is causing the delay, especially with the Dark Roast. According to Senseo the coffee should be by June or July at the latest. Or so they say. I am surprised that they have not made this info more available. Seems like many will simply move on to another coffee machine. Meanwhile try using a regular coffee filter and espresso grind your own coffee. I've tried Starbucks coffee and not bad. Less creama, but good flavor. Google 'make your own coffee pods' to see the methods used to trim the filter and pack the coffee.

 Really Delicous Unsweetened Green Tea,5,"This green tea has a very natural flavor. The taste of green tea is present without all of the sugar and sugar substitutes that are added to most other bottled teas. Because it is unsweetened, it only has a very slight sweetness and the aftertaste is very mild. I've tried quite of few teas in my time, and it is not an easy task to find a good unsweetened green tea. This is definitely it. The only true unsweetened green tea that rivals this one is the powder mix version ( Natural Organic Instant Green Tea Powder 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free! ) which I only keep in my cupboard because of the better price when purchased as a mix, and I drink a lot of tea!

 1 out of 2 dogs liked it!,4,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:42 Mins </span>Since neither of my 2 dogs can write about this new Lickety Stik, I will do my best. A new idea for treats is always welcomed. We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver. We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey. Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol). Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike. I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it. First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly. It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog. If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable. It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label. The video is one of our taste tests.

 Read the description!,5,"I'm glad I ordered this without reading the negative reviews, but even if I had at least I have the reading comprehension to understand that the two things most people are complaining about are actually listed IN THE DESCRIPTION. Who buys something online without reading the description first? Honestly... 1. Yes it comes in a brown paper/zip lock bag. Whoop de doo. You could still give it as a gift, just get your own cellophane bag and tie it off with ribbons. If you have a lot of friends with keurig machines you'd be able to pick a couple flavors for each friend, and it would be adorable to do a little gift bag with a coffee cup and these. 2. Yes some of the coffees were ones I don't like, and yes some of them were repeats, that's what happens when you order a grab bag. It flat out states in the description that you will most likely NOT get 1 pack of each of the flavors, and that the flavors listed are EXAMPLES, you are not guaranteed which ones you will receive. If you can't accept those two ""downsides"" don't get this product. Instead try Keurig K-Cups Travel The World Sampler Pack (35 K-Cups) Those are supposedly the same every time, and the gift box is supposedly adorable. Twice the price, but hey, if it's what you're looking for... As for myself, all of the cups arrived in fine condition. Yes I did get an overage of a particular flavor(I'm really fortunate that I love hazelnut coffee) but I liked that many of them were multiples. Since I live with my boyfriend this mean that we can each try a cup of the flavors with extras. And if we don't like one we can save it for when company comes, someone we know will probably enjoy the cup. As a service that allows you to try a bunch of flavors without having to buy a box of each this was cheap and pretty effective. I'll be purchasing again, and next time I'll be sure to come on here and put in which flavors I get, I didn't write them down this time, and they're all mixed in with some other samplers now. …",48 out of 50 users found this review helpful
" Not RAW, not honest",1,"Notice how it says ""Raw dog food"" then ""with chicken"". It's written this way because it's not entirely raw, the chicken is cooked. Cooked proteins are likely to be allergenic! The whole point of a raw diet it for it to be raw so it isn't allergenic and is easy to digest, and of course the most important part of the dog's diet is the protein source. I wish this company would stop trying to trick people into thinking their food is raw. Some dogs do not do well on this product. The owners assume it is raw and then assume raw doesn't work. In many of these cases, the dog would benefit from a truly raw diet. For this reason I really wish The Honest Kitchen would straighten up and give up the practice of deceit. They are essentially harming many, many animals who could find relief on a truly raw diet. I have already had this discussion with their representative many years ago. The company did change their wording so that they no longer tell outright lies, but it is still deceptive. I can't imagine they care about anyone's pet if they carry on like this. If your pet has had issues such as hot spots, digestive upset, body odor, itchy feet or any other chronic condition, ask your vet if it could be an allergy to the cooked proteins in this diet. If it is, and you were under the impression that you were feeding raw protein, let the manufacturer know. They have to know how many pets they are harming, or they will never straighten up. …",3 out of 13 users found this review helpful
" Bold, but Not Teeth Jarring Bold. Nice Flavor and a Nice Cup of Coffee.",4,"Wolfgang Puck French Roast is a nice, bold (not too bold), flavorful cup of coffee. If you like People Extra Bold Organic, Dark Roast Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2) , then you should like Wolfgang Puck's French Roast. This French Roast has a deep flavor with a hint of sweetness and a smooth finish - a good choice for a morning cup of coffee. Recommended. (Note to Manufacturer: as a consumer, I wish you would use real coffee descriptions(i.e., hints of ****, smooth finish) rather than fluff advertising like ""Bring the aromas of France home with you and ""Profitez des bons moments"" (enjoy the good moments)!"" - what does that really mean? It took me awhile to decide to purchase this coffee because the description gave me zero idea of what to expect). …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 filled the need perfectly:),4,"My son worked as a barista at our local $tarbucks for two years. He is 25 this next month and still lives at home....though attending college...so he has a temporary reprieve from being shoved out of the nest. He works 'occasionally' and does not contribute what we feel is an adequate amount towards living here... so I have taken advantage of his 'professional' training as a barista as part of the trade off of his still living here. HOW NICE TO HAVE MY OWN PRIVATE BARISTA ! :) I was looking for COFFEE SYRUP, made from coffee to use in coffee based beverages and in other cooking. In the past, I have made my own home-made flavored liquers so knew we could come up with our own COFFEE flavored syrup (just without the alcohol which can be added at any time). A rich and bold espresso is ideal for the flavoring, and this whole bean LAVAZZA Top Class ESPRESSO fit the bill perfectly! My son coarsely grinds the beans and brews at a high coffee to water ratio, strains and adds to simple syrup of sugar and water that we cook various lengths of time depending on how thick (and caramelized) we want the syrup. SUCCESS and, though it may be hard to believe that a simple syrup made at home can taste 'fresh' compared to commercially bottled, THIS really does! COFFEE NIRVANA :) We made ours thick enough, that, it is like a thick (more boiled down) maple syrup and was heavenly when added to a frappe AND then, drizzled over the whipped cream we placed on top of the frappe. So, I highly recommended the LAVAZZA Espresso 'espressly' for this purpose. Also good ground for my Biallita stovetop Moka coffee brewer and other methods of brewing. …",2 out of 16 users found this review helpful
" Makes a cup of coffee taste like a candy bar, without the calories",5,"If you haven't tried this product you really should buy a bottle and experience it for yourself. I think that it is good enough that you won't miss the sugar. Water is so good for us, but so boring. If you are trying to increase your consumption of water, try a little of this in the water. This product can also be used to make an Italian soda (a little syrup, a little cream, and some sparkling water). Another yummy treat, if only they made a fat free cream it would be perfect. My husband and I have been buying this brand of sugar free syrup for years. A pump of this syrup into your coffee changes it from a standard morning beverage into a liquid candy bar in a mug. I recently switched from half and half to soy milk in my coffee. With this syrup in my coffee the switch to soy milk was very easy. The ingredients in this product (listed in order) are as follows: Purified water Natural flavors Caramel color Potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate (to preserve freshness) Citric acid Xantham gum Sucralose (splenda brand) Acesulfame potassium Nutrition Facts label reads as follows: Serving Size: 1 oz.

 Another great dark K-cup coffee,4,"I love the rich, full-bodied flavor of a dark-roast coffee. When I bought my first Keurig machine I wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast K-cups that I could find. I initially settled on Newman's Own Dark Roast as my ""go-to"" coffee, but I didn't stop there. I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new. I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away. It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it. Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try. Here is my impression of it: After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story. It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness. I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People's Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand. However, I will keep looking for something new. Who knows what I will find?

" not fresh, no aroma, chicory flavor",2,"The box arrived on July 22, the date on the coffee bag is Sept 30. So that doesn't leave much shelf time here. Thing is, most vacpac coffee has at least a 6 month shelf life, so that is worrisome. Opened the bag, no smell. That in itself tells the whole story. Coffee is aromatic. You open a bag of bean, particularly french roast bean and you're going to smell coffee, even before you grind it. It's the nature of the oils on the roasted coffee beans, and it definitely affects the flavor and experience. no smell. Brewed up a pot this morning in my cuisinart coffee grinder/brewer: beans were not consistant in roasting, some darker than others no aroma when brewing whatsoever coffee turned out very dark med chicory like flavor coffee flavor not strong or rich. I've been playing with this coffee for a couple of days and after a while it's not terrible. Compared to a stronger flavored French Roast, it pales. But on it's own, if this is how you like your coffee, okay. I can't say if it's the blend of bean or if it's fact that it was roasted a long time ago and it's lost it's strength. But it lacks a rich coffee flavor. except it has that mild chicory backtaste going. so if you want a mild coffee with a hint of chicory, you found it. …",8 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Beware new formula!,1,"Be very aware that the new formula ALS is not agreeing with a lot of dogs.

Canidae made major changes to their ALS formulas and did nothing to alert the public until they had to (their web site only). There is still nothing on the bags to make people aware of the changes except a new ingredient list. Do your homework before buying this dog food.

 Visually unappealing.,2,"I have to say, this is an interesting product that I was very excited to try. It's different! I mean how often to you hear someone say they drink black water! When I received my package, first thing I did was open a bottle and took a whiff. I wasn't expecting any smell considering it's supposed to be just like water. I have to say there is a slight subtle smell to it initially, but after a while it was gone. So now it's time for the taste! I took a sip, expecting off-putting flavor and quite frankly, my body was prepared to gag because we don't normally drink black water. I couldn't get past imagining I was drinking a mixture of gasoline and water. Unlike regular water, blk tastes a little bit smoother. I do also detect more of a metallic taste to it but it's very subtle. Once you swallow, it leaves a little dry feeling in the back of your throat like when you drink gatorade. I wouldn't consider blk to be very refreshing. I find myself needing a drink of regular water after the sampling. The only reason I can see anyone drinking this is if they're wanting the benefits of fulvic acid. Other than that, I can't see myself repurchasing this again. It seems to be like when Heinz released blue ketchup and it failed. Food/drink needs to be visually appealing. Unless it is flavored, regular blk is just going to make people gag. I wouldn't recommend this product. …",15 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Newman's Own Organics Dog Food,5,"I cannot express enough how pleased I am with this dog food. I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding. For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems. Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food. After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me. Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is. I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority. I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair ****. I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go.

I've found that most jams are really not sweet enough if you go less than 3 cups of sugar per batch. It still beats the heck out of the 7 or 8 cups sugar that a standard pectin recipe calls for.

 So happy to find these here!,5,"I love these noodles. While no one would every mistake them for ""spaghetti"", they contain zero carbs and fat, zero calories, and zero Weigh Watcher points. Once you rinse them well and heat them up (they don't really need to be cooked), you can pour on any kind of sauce or use them in a stir fry in place of any other Asian noodle and you'll be satisfied in knowing that you can eat your fill but not be going overboard on caloric intake. Of course, if you use a lot of oil or a rich sauce like alfredo (yum), you'll need to take that into account. I used to live near a large international market and was able to pick these up weekly, as I needed them. They were actually not called ""Miracle Noodle"" but were the same product, with Japanese writing on the bags. They were also about 1/2 the price of Miracle Noodles. However, no longer being able to find them anywhere nearby, I was very happy to order these on Superstore. The price seems reasonable, and they were quickly shipped right to my door. I learned from reading other reviews here that these can also be frozen until ready for use. That's a big plus and was pivotal in my decision to order a whole case. I'll probably go through them rather quickly so opted to order them on auto-ship at an additional discount. For those of you who haven't used Superstore's auto-ship option, I highly recommend that for any grocery item that you're likely to reorder regularly.

 Where are the hazel nuts (filberts)?,4,"My company had a celebration where this was one of the snacks served. I had one of them and was excited because these are a lot of my favorite nuts in one pouch, which is hard to find. The first thing I did after the celebration was go on Superstore to subscribe to get these regularly. However, I should have looked at the picture more closely before I ordered because when they arrived I was disappointed to find out that the hazel nuts had been ""replaced"" by walnuts. Everything is exactly the same as the ones I had at work. The package looks the same, they both say ""Heart Healthy Mix"" on them, except walnuts have been substituted instead of hazel nuts. Unfortunately, hazel nuts are my favorite. Otherwise, these are very good, just not as good (in my opinion) as if they had hazel nuts in them.

 Secret Pleasure  &  Nutritional Powerhouse,5,"My first culinary memory involves a surreptitious finger dip into the Marmite jar at the age of three; it is the first food I remember really loving. And ever since then I have had difficulty getting enough of it. Not everyone reacts to it the same way. Some imagine it looks too much like axle grease. Others complain that it smells too much like beer left overnight to go bad. These facts suggest that one might only serve it to close friends and only when there are some alternatives. In any case, the Marmite claim ""Love it or Hate it"" is quite apropos. It rarely evokes a neutral reaction. The best preparation I can think of is to mix it thoroughly with butter. One part Marmite to two or three parts butter. Then spread thinly on toast. Served this way, the primary flavor of Marmite is salt. Then there is a subtle meaty flavor sometimes called umami - it's a flavor that is present in well browned mushrooms or red meat. The label suggests that it might be put to excellent use in soup stocks as a substitute or supplement to caramelized roasted vegetables - onions and carrots. As for nutritional value, even spread thinly it is dynamite. Those who fall hopelessly for its charms may find themselves consuming mega-doses of a few crucial B vitamins. It is an exceptionally rich source of B12, folicin, and B6. And since it is free of animal products it is an ideal food to include in a Vegan diet which normally falls short in delivering B12. …",41 out of 42 users found this review helpful

He loves the taste of the Pillpockets, I don't think we can now do without them. He likes them so much, we use them as treats for special occasions. They have made treating Andy a pleasant experience, rather than a ordeal. I wish I would have invented them. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" AMAZING, but MAKE YOUR OWN (Steps below).",1,"This stuff is soooooooooooooo good. I could eat it out of the jar all day! My only problem is how RIDICULOUSLY overpriced this is. Its currently ~$13 at my local Whole Foods. As a college student,I can't be spending that much on something like this! That said, I found a CHEAP, EASY alternative that tastes JUST like it. I went to my local indian food store and bought a few bags of powdered / coconut flakes for about $1.50 , threw it in the blender on pulse for a few min, then on high, then on medium, then when it started getting clumped and creamy I set it to low for about 5-6 minutes. Tastes JUST Like it, same consistency, taste, everything. No oil needed,no milk, no sugar, no heat, not even a food processor. The oils come out naturally from the dried coconut flakes/ powder. The butter came out a bit creamier than that in the can, which is a bonus for some considering consistency seemed to be the biggest complain against this product. Anyways, I just saved myself over $10 making this in 15min or less. Artisana is banking serious $$ on something so simple and inexpensive to make. Enjoy! Thank me later lol. …",227 out of 251 users found this review helpful
" Blk Water, pretty good actually",4,"I happened upon this water at my health food grocery after working out this evening. I drank half the bottle before looking down and realizing that the black was not decorative packaging but actually the color of the water! It doesn't taste like plain water, but not so unlike plain water that you think you are drinking something else...it tastes like water with a little extra mineral in it and it is not sparkling, by the way. I'll have to say I was surprised to find myself liking it. I had a mild sore throat (cold maybe coming on?) and a painful cold sore starting in my mouth. The blk water made the area a little numb/tingling (like hydrogen peroxide does when put on a cut to disinfect) at first and then...after a minute or so the cold sore didn't hurt and my throat didn't either anymore. I'm not one for miracle cures, etc, but this made me feel pretty good. I don't know anything about Fulvic Acid, so I looked it up and it seems people are pitching it as the new ""superfood"" supplement; that said it's hard to find much factual information on how exactly it is helpful or not for humans. …",23 out of 32 users found this review helpful

 The greatest addition to our meals,5,"My husband and I have these noodles everyday. I can create easy meals with them. Love to stir fry onions, garlic, fresh tomatoes and add seasonings , taco sauce or salsa , chili powder, ginger all in water. Then maybe some meat 3.5 ozs . Can slice frozen chicken breasts in processor then stir fry till done. Just a few minutes then rinse noodles in strainer and add to stir fry when everything else is done. You have a plate full of food and most calories are from the meat. Very satisfying. My husband has lost over 40-50 lbs and I have lost over 30 lbs. This is one addition to the rest of our lives.

 AN INGREDIENT CAN INTERFERE WITH MEDICATION,1,"NOTICE TO ANY PRESCRIPTION DRUG PATIENTS ... it is not clear on most liquid stevia products how many of them (this one included) utilize ""grapefruit seed extract"" as an additive (typically as a natural preservative). If you take any medication that restricts or suggests avoidance of grapefruit ""juice,"" I strongly recommend that do a bit of research before relying on the ""seed extract"" issue as not be included as a concern. My research has shown that grapefruit ""seed extract"" can have the same impact as grapefruit ""juice"" relative to interfering with how some medications are metabolized or absorbed. It appears they (grapefruit juice and/or seed extract) actually have the ability to render some drugs almost completely ineffective. I have been a long term user and advocate of the positive benefits of grapefruit seed extract as a supplement (natural anti-fungal, anti-yeast, antibacterial, etc.); however, really had not expected that grapefruit ""seed extract"" might, in fact, end up as an unexpected additive and, more specifically, that it (seed extract) would end up showing the same evidence of drug interference as grapefruit juice does with two of the drugs I am required to take. I already knew about ""no grapefruit juice"" at all, but no mention of the grapefruit seed extract connection. Of course I understand that this product includes an incredibly small percentage of the seed extract, unfortunately, I haven't found any conclusive information regarding any ""acceptable"" amounts of the seed extract or data addressing any sort of ""volume"" thresholds of juice or seed extract. I'm disappointed I can't use this product anymore (and wish I'd known this sooner and/or even thought to ask my doctor or pharmacist sooner); however, I FEEL SO STRONGLY that I should introduce this issue to anybody else this might effect regarding health recovery, maintenance, or quality of life. -- PLEASE ALSO NOTE: I only gave one star to enable this to post (and hopefully get any appropriate individual(s)' attention). This was a five star product for me for quite some time as far as quality of taste, overall value, and excellent ""blend-ability"" with any kind of fluid or food ... it really is one of the best if you have no restrictions. I'm sad I can't use this type anymore. I do now, however, use some stevita packets that I like, and am trying a couple liquids that are available that don't have the grapefruit seed extract additive (or at least not listed) ... I'll post a review if/when I find one I can confidently verify as grapefruit seed extract free. …",10 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 did not work for me unfortunately,2,"I am very surprised that I felt the way I did after trying one of these 5 hour energy drinks. I did not think there was that much caffeine in each one but apparently there is because I had the jitter attacks bi-time which started about ten minutes after I finished the bottle. I got the sick feeling and it did not go away for, well about 5 hours actually. I was very close to putting my finger down my throat to try to throw it up thinking maybe that would make me feel better, although I'm a pretty big wimp so I didn't do that. I am not overly sensitive to caffeine but while the 5-hour energy drink obviously works for some people, it did not work for me. I tried green tea capsules about a week later (yes I was on the hunt for a good energy booster) and I have not had one negative experience to report. I also recommend raspberry ketones which I take with the green tea, Tea Extract 60 Capsules (500mg) + FREE 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder . I think I found a good combination for me, finally. The only reason I need to take something for energy is because I start work at 5am everyday, which means I get up at 3:45am!

 This filter works PERFECT!,5,"Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the ""old fashion way"" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size. I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Superstore, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry. The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I.

Dogs that don't have a lot of energy and/or have little body fat (like sighthounds) do not need this much protein, and processing it can be very bad for their livers. This is a high quality food, I love that it is made by a small company in Canada, and many people have had great success with it. But know that it is NOT for every dog!

They come in a flimsy bag that popped open but since they're also in a shipping box, it didn't really matter to me. The thing that matters most to me is that I get the MOST rawhide for my dollar because my 3 dogs chew through this stuff pretty fast. At first my dogs weren't too excited -- I guess because these are not flavored like some of the smaller brown or yellow bones, so I just set them on the floor and walked away. It only took a few minutes before they picked them up and began chewing away on them. Now, when I hand them out, they don't hesitate to happily run off to their corners and chew. Now, price-wise, it works out to $0.24 an ounce for these long-lasting bones. When I compare that to even the ""cheapy"" bones from the 99 Cent Store, it's HALF the price.

 Excellent Source of Magnesium,5,"If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too. I've also tried a flavored version of this product (Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder). Unlike that version, this stuff is entirely odorless, and the only taste is a sense of tartness. I much prefer this non-flavored version over the flavored version. The only problem I have with this product is that it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage. That's pretty insignificant. So, I still rate it at an Excellent five stars out of five. Highly recommended. Especially if you're taking calcium. …",18 out of 22 users found this review helpful

" Excellent, Please Keep Away",5,"My friends figured I was a heavyweight when it came to hot sauce. I douse most of what I eat in Tabasco sauce; I snack on jalape&ntilde;os sometimes. You get the idea. So for my birthday recently, I received The Source, innocuously perched on top of a small pile of gifts. I decided to try it the same day and to reassure everyone that my mouth was an impenetrable fortress. 7.1 million Scoville units seemed like quite a challenge, but is the sauce an unstoppable force against an immovable object? I tested it out on some chips and salsa (hot, of course) remaining after we devoured pretty much everything else. Just two or three drops mixed into this half jar of salsa should do the trick, right? I bit down onto the salsa-coated chip and immediately could not comprehend what was going on. My pupils must have doubled in area. My knees buckled. No one around me could understand the agony I went through past my teary blubbering and groans. The first bite had a profound effect on my senses as the world faded around me, but would only become more intense with time. I couldn't think straight. I gagged, I wailed, I pleaded for help. My bowels broke down as the salsa dripped little by little into my esophagus, making a sound like a dragon's gullet before projecting flame. My body had prepared itself for only the mildest of capsaicin encounters. Not even a steel maw could have stopped this. And as if the dragon noises were omens, I returned to my senses and vomited. All over the table, some of the guests, everywhere. It was a travesty. The Source's foul domain flew out in a projectile, but soon followed the cake and pizza. Then everything. I'm pretty sure blood made it in there. I only felt alleviated while breathing again after the ordeal. However, by no means did the unholy taste leave. It coated the inside of my digestive tract like some sort of visceral cinnamon challenge. I, no longer having anything to puke, writhed and rolled around for a moment and relieved my bowels before sensing the darkness take over me. When I came to, I was in a hospital bed and understandably confused. Only an hour later did the head doctor come around to checking me.

 Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor,4,"To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes. NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words ""Medium Extra Bold"" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same.

I did find them in the fresh veggie section, but even those were $3.99 for 2 and I needed at least 16 for the extract. I decided to see what I could find online. This store (JR Mushrooms & Specialties, Inc.) has great reviews and the price of the beans was reasonable. The beans arrived quickly and I was impressed with the quality - plump, NOT dry and the smell was heavenly. I made a coconut cream pie for Thanksgiving dessert and decided ""What the heck. Let's give cooking with the fresh beans a try."" In addition to the vanilla extract called for in the recipe, I split a vanilla bean and scraped the seeds into the mixture. OMG! I have never tasted coconut cream pie this good. The only difference was the addition of the fresh vanilla. My BIL called the next day to rave about the pie AGAIN. I dropped the rest of the cut pod into a bottle of vodka (I'm using Tito's Handmade Vodka) and have continued to add pods as I use them in cooking. The extract isn't ready (it hasn't even been 1 month since I started it), but the smell is wonderful and the taste is well on the way to perfection.

THEN I read the label. Hydrolyzed soy protein. Not only is soy already bad for your health beyond a quick-reached 10g a day ""healthy moderation"" level, but hydrolyzed soy (hydrolyzed ""vegetable protein"" almost always being soy, too) is full of MSG. It's not alone-- autolyzed yeast, corn-sourced maltodextrin (which is nearly all maltodextrin anymore), the list goes on, but in short they are all MSG... only unlike Europe, America does not require that special ""enhancer"" code for various food additives and we as a result have to constantly be stealthy (thanks, Monsanto). So that said, I did taste a bit of it, trusting his comment of no MSG (it makes my head and stomach both feel like a vice grip is being tightened on them)... and as I am sensitized to the weird not-salt flavor of it, I stopped and asked politely to see the package. Sure enough, glaring at me is MSG... For taste, I'd give it 3 stars overall--the MSG taste isn't super-strong, but it is apparent enough to set off all my alarms nonetheless, so I couldn't enjoy it.

 A Great Coffee,5,"Folgers Classic Roast Instant Coffee, 4-Ounce Jar (Pack of 6) is ""aroma-roasted, specially ground and made from Mountain Grown® beans, the world's richest and most aromatic."" It is the way we prefer coffee. It is nothing but coffee -- really great coffee. My friend tried to sneak another brand in, but I could not tolerate it. There are a few other kinds I like, but I always depend on Folgers to taste the way classic coffee is supposed to taste. The history of Folgers goes back to the 1600's when the Folger family moved from England to Massachusetts Bay Colony. Shortly after arriving in America, Peter Folger married Mary Morrell. In 1849, three Folger brothers went to the West Coast to mine for gold. One of the boys, James Folger, stayed in San Francisco because he did not have the money to finish the trip. In 1850, he went to work as a carpenter building a placed called The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice MIlls. After working at the mill for a year, he had enough money to stake a claim and go to mine for gold. He carried spice and coffee samples with him. (Before then, people had bought green coffee beans to be roasted at home. Factory roasted coffee was revolutionary.) Eventually he returned to San Francisco, became a partner in the business, and bought the company in 1872. He called it J. A. Folger & Company. The family business expanded to Texas and Kansas City. (For more of the story go to www.folgers ) Now, for the history of our Folgers. My friend travels extensively and sometimes takes me along. He always has a jar of instant Folgers in his suitcase. He likes the instant coffee crystals classic roast better than brewed coffee. I didn't know for a couple of years that he was toting his coffee around in his suitcase, but finally there was a time on a trip that he brought me a cup of coffee from his hotel room to mine. Wow! It really is great coffee. I use this delicious coffee (along with pureed collard greens!) to make some of the best chocolate cake you ever put in your mouth. I tell all about this special practice in The Collard Patch. …",8 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Great Tasting But Disappointed They're Packed in Vietnam,3,"I recently found Wild Planet and purchased both the Wild Sardines and their Tuna. The taste is amazing in both the sardines and tuna. It simply can't be beaten and, they use BPA free cans which is very rare in this country. Thanks to another review on Superstore, I discovered that many of the canned goods I was buying for my family that were organic, were also packed in cans coated in a lining that includes BPA. I did some research and discovered Wild Planet. Their tuna and sardines are more expensive but it's worth it because all of their products are sustainably caught, and packaged responsibly. They're good for our planet and great for my family. The only reason I'm not rating them 5 stars is because the sardines are processed in Vietnam and not the US. The tuna is processed here. The sardines are not, and while I'm sure the canneries used are monitored by Wild Planet, I would much rather serve my family something that was packaged in this country giving fellow Americans much needed jobs. I also think that with the price of the sardines, they should be packaged here. Anyway, if taste is your only concern, buy these sardines. They're the best I've tasted. If you care where your food is processed, these might not be for you--altho, no sardines are processed in this country anymore so I guess we're just out of luck. For some reason, we Americans don't seem to care that we now make very little in our own country. Go figure. …",13 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 I made some impressive vanilla ice cream with these beans,5,"I used one of these beans to make some fresh vanilla ice cream last Monday night. The recipe came from Season #1 of ""Good Eats"", Churn Baby Churn. 2 cups of half & half, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup sugar, a little pure fruit pectan, and one of these beans. Heat the cream to 170 degrees, mix in your other ingredients well, then kill the heat. You now have ""ice cream batter"". Pour the batter in a sealed container, and place the container in the Frig for 6 hours. After 6 hours, get out your ice cream maker and churn for about 30-35 minutes. I find longer is better. Alton Brown put up a little notification prior to a commercial break stating that Madagascar beans are the most sought-after despite the fact that the Mexican beans are more flavorful. Regrettably, the only source of vanilla beans in my hood is Williams-Sonoma, and they only carry the Madagascar beans. Those do make for a delicious vanilla ice cream, but I didn't want to pass on the opportunity for more flavor. I decided to test Alton's claim by ordering some these beans. The results are pretty sensational. I pretty much mopped up the floor with some house guests last. They loved the beef bourguignon and the Paella I made, but the vanilla ice cream afterward knocked 'em dead. Let's just say they were flabbergasted. Make some vanilla ice cream. You will like the results. Is Alton correct about Mexican v Madagascar beans? I don't know about that. I think the Mexican bean is the far more familiar flavor. If you are an American, you grew up on the flavor of the Mexican vanilla beans. This flavor has the home field advantage. The Madagascar bean is more exotic. It has a coffee-vanilla kind of flavor. I like them both. I think I will cut half a Madagascar and half a Mexican bean on my next batch, and see what the combined flavor is like. …",16 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Cheaper at Walmart,3,"Good stuff....but. I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag). I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Superstore (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors. I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there. (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Superstore about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Superstore plus you have to purchase it in bulk). I find that I tend to order blindly from Superstore when I'm actually purchasing from Superstore and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings. This was a bit of a wake-up call. I will give kudos to Superstore for their customer service policies, though. I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free. …",42 out of 54 users found this review helpful

 great and cheap!,5,"ill get the neg's out of the way. ....the bag. fist time i used it the glue holding on the ziplock part, came unglued. thats it. as fo the product its great. many servings for a great price considering acai is an expensive product and difficult to handle. i emailed navitas and they informed me that this product is considered ""RAW"" so it is not denatured and none of the benefits derived are damaged or altered. plus with the powder over the liquid, you get the skin kept in the mix which with fruits and such, this is where most of the beneficials come from. so i say A+ oh and taste is great. i literally teaspoon some and just put it in my mouth twice a day. study acai and stop your other supps so you can buy this as a replacement. benefits are endless in this nutrient deficient society. and real food is the most bio-available source!! …",21 out of 28 users found this review helpful
 As ineffective for me as sugar-free Red Bull...,1,"First off, let me repeat what a few other reviewers have remarked: different people are likely to have somewhat varied reactions to this product. And some background: In the past I've had both Red Bull and Sugar-free Red Bull. Red Bull works wonders for me. If I take it at 10pm, I have great focus and concentration and I can stay up working all night long through to the morning. But Sugar-free Red Bull has no effect on me whatsoever. I can take it at 10pm and fall asleep 10 minutes later. '5-Hour Energy' has a very similar effect on me as Sugar-free Red Bull. Which is, basically, nothing. That said, '5-hour Energy' appears to be more likely to (1) give me a headache, (2) make me lethargic, (3) and make me want to go to sleep. So, if you are like me and need sugar for Red Bull to work for you, then likely this '5-hour Energy' drink won't do anything for you either. …",12 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Not a drum... lots of packets!,4,"FYI - If you were thinking you'd get a big drum of cocoa, think again. It's not made clear when you order it... but this is a 60.55 ounce container of INDIVIDUAL packets!!! If you're ordering this for a business setting or perhaps if you want premeasured amounts for your individual use this package is fine. It's two big boxes full of individual packets. (Now I'm going to be sitting at home ripping open packets to fill a small drum... RATS! …",14 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 The quantity of eyeballs was not listed,3,"The eyeballs are great, but when purchasing, I could not find a quantity listed. Considering a package was $7.30, I assumed the package would have quite a large amount of eyeballs (much more than the 9 pictured). There were 56 eyeballs in the package, ($.13 each) which (again) would have been helpful to know when I ordered. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!,5,"I was a Red Bull drinker, coffee drinker and whatever else I could get my hands on to give me the energy I so desperately needed to get through some days. Someone suggested i try this 5 hour energy and WOW! It really did work without the ""drop"" afterwards. I have noticed that when I take more than 3 a week I start to build up a resistance and they don't work quite as well.... but hey! That's what happens when you drink caffein too, right? …",33 out of 45 users found this review helpful
 Is this really Taffy Town?,1,"There is something odd with the product description. The description says ""Taffy Town"" by it also says it is manufactured by ""Candy Crate Salt Water Taffy"" not ""Taffy Town."" Taffy Town makes very good stuff; the flavors taste natural and it is certainly not salty. I'm echoing the the previous review's one star because I'm assuming this product is actually not Taffy Town. Other vendors on Superstore sell the Taffy Town product and it gets about four stars. Taffy Town is at least four stars in my book. Confusing. …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Full-flavored Decaf!,5,"I recently bought a Senseo machine and the Douwe Egberts Coffee pods. The pods make a full-flavored decaf that is very enjoyable. I agree the medium roast and mild roast are weak sisters compared to the dark roast. <p>Medium is what several of my guests prefer, however. I use the dark for myself and they all make a very good cuppa joe. MUCH better than my drip machine, and a lot easier to use than my espresso maker. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Chocolate Truffles,5,"Absolutely delicious, rich, cocoa-coated chocolate drops. Smooth texture, devine flavor, melt-in-your-mouth good! These are a great bargain at 2 lbs.

 Very good tortilla strips but packaging is poor.,4,"My order arrived in a big cardboard box. The bags were just placed in the box and shipped. No plastic cover or anything to protect the bags from insects, moisture, dust, etc. I'm pleased with the product but not the packaging.

 Licorice Lovers--You must check this out!,5,"Those of you who love licorice or anise flavor and who happen to be tea-drinkers, rejoice! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic. The anise/licorice flavor is intense. The tea is relatively sweet, so in my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary, but you may want to add a little honey to it. This is not a wimpy tea, but full bodied and the longer you steep it, the stronger it gets. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful
" Great Product, but Misleading Price",5,"This offering is very misleading. A 2.2lb bag is NEVER $33.00, and the discount advertised here is WAY overblown.

 Weak Coffee,1,"I bought 4 bags because of the good review. I love coffee and have been a coffee drinker for 30+ years. High expectation which met with very disappointing result. I find this coffee very weak in smell and taste. Folgers easily beats it and far far inferior to Blue Mountain Brand. Now, I got stuck with 4 bags! Don't buy. …",8 out of 15 users found this review helpful
" Intensely salty, healthy salt",5,"We were pleased with this salt. It's actually more salty than regular salt, even kosher salt or sea salt. A little bit goes a long way!
