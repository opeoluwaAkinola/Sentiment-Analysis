 OPPS!!  Not the same as the True Lemon in envelopes,3,"This True Lemon is not the same as the True Lemon that is sold in the single serving envelope. It does not have the fresh Lemon flavor that the envelopes have. The envelopes are labeled for use in water, teas & recipes. The large jar is labeled for cooking, baking, & seasoning. I called the manufacturer and they said the true lemon is different in the jar because it is designed to survive the heat of cooking and baking. If you want the taste of fresh Lemon for beverages, you have to use the True Lemon in envelopes. …",13 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Almost perfect organic olive oil,4,"The price and quality of this product are both fantastic. I love that the dark, tin container greatly protects the taste and integrity of the oil (versus the typical glass bottle). However, there is an inherent problem with the pouring spout. It is plastic and very short. This leads to oil dripping on the top during usage, which is both wasteful and messy. If the manufacturer would alter that one component, this would be the perfect organic olive oil. …",16 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Not as good as I hoped...,3,"I have to say I was disappointed - it may just have been my batch, but the texture was closer to mass-produced supermarket cheddar rather than a raw milk boutique cheese. Rubbery mouth feel and a mild, innocuous taste. I was hoping for much more from this cheese based on the write up and awards. Overall, this is an easy to eat cheese that would be good to serve to friends who are put off by stronger, flavorful cheeses. …",11 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Great Value,5,"My wife and I really enjoy saffron rice but the problem is that saffron is getting so expensive. I was a little nervous about the quality of this brand because the price was so low. Well, this is good stuff. When this is gone I will purchase more of this same brand. One hint, I live in a very humid area, Brazil. I have thrown out more spices than most folks buy in a lifetime. I now put all of my spices in 1/2 pint Ball or Kerr caning jars and vacuum pack them with a Food Saver.

" Usually good flavor, but thhis time it had terrible taste.",1,"This is not the first time I order Lavazza Supercrema, and usually I liked it for my everyday espresso. However this time item was out of stock for a long time and I canceled subscription but forgot to cancel that particular order that was lingering until the product became available. Anyway, I ordered Grand Tiera as I couldn't wait for Supercrema and I got my initial bag of Supercrema unexpectedly but it was still OK as I had guests and beans were going like crazy until I got a big surprise when I brewed the first cup with these beans. I thought it must be something wrong with my machine or the water filter, so I tried to brew the other Grand Tiera beans that were almost over and the espresso was OK.

" Heart-healthy, extremely dark chocolate",4,"Lindt is a famous Swiss chocolate maker, and all its various chocolates are wonderful, including this extremely dark chocolate--in its own way. For those who are used to semisweet or sweet chocolate, the flavor of this bar may seem surprisingly bitter and take some getting used to, but if you are a connoisseur without a strong ""sweet tooth,"" you will likely enjoy this chocolate very much. As for my own particular tastes, I found it rather too bitter, and so did my husband. I personally prefer dark chocolate with a bit less cacao, such as Chocolate Intense Dark Twilight Delight 72% Cacao . The question some may ask who love sweet, milk chocolate is, why pay more money (often quite a bit more) for dark chocolate such as this that doesn't taste sweet? The main reason for most people in the over-50 crowd is the health benefits to be gained from consuming dark chocolate. The more chocolate contained in a chocolate bar, the more of the good stuff--cacao--that you are getting. In short, the more ""bang"" for your ""buck."" Over the last four years there have been dozens of scientific studies analyzing and confirming substantial health benefits from a small amount of dark chocolate consumed daily. The latest findings from a Harvard study released in early 2011 indicate that as little as 6 gm. of dark chocolate (about 30 calories) is a sufficient daily ""dose."" The original German studies in 2007 used Ritter Sport chocolate, but I haven't so far been able to discover which kind of Ritter's dark chocolate was used by the researchers. However, since Ritter's only makes two types, 50% cacao and 71% cacao, this product, at 90% cocoa, fits well within the parameters of that study. An equivalent amount of this chocolate compared to that in the study would be a little more than one-half of one of its 10 gm. individual squares. (Note: the package lists a ""serving"" as ""four squares"" which is 40 gms. This is almost seven times the 6 gm. amount that researchers found is sufficient to improve health.) The health benefits of dark chocolate are due to the flavonoids contained in cocoa. Flavonoids act as antioxidants in the body, which both prevent and reduce inflammation. Over many years of medical research, has been found to contribute to or directly cause a host of diseases, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and cancer, as well as autoimmune diseases like arthritis. Flavonoids are found in the pigments of fruits and vegetables which give them their color. The darker and deeper the color of a fruit or vegetable, the greater the amount of flavonoids it contains. Cocoa is derived from the dark-brown cacao bean, which is the fruit of the tropical tree, theobroma cacao. In any chocolate product, such as this one, the higher the percentage of cocoa/cacao, the more flavonoids the chocolate contains. Dark chocolate such as this product is better for your health than milk chocolate because it contains more antioxidants, which are good for you, and less sugar, which is not good for you--especially if you have diabetes or are struggling with your weight. The FDA defines categories of chocolate based on how much cocoa/cacao is in a given product: 1. Unsweetened chocolate with no additives is 100% cocoa. Most all brands of baker's chocolate fall into this category. Their ingredient list will state simply, ""chocolate."" 2. Bittersweet chocolate contains 35-99% cocoa (35% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids. There is a large range of products in this category, and the product names reflect the amount of chocolate they contain. Unsweetened chocolate is very bitter, and the more cocoa in a product, the less room for sugar, and the more bitter it will be. In order to avoid frightening off customers who are used to sweet chocolate, marketers often substitute the words ""dark,"" ""extra dark"" or ""intense"" for ""bitter"" if that word is not paired with ""sweet,"" for example as ""bittersweet"" or ""extra bittersweet."" This product lies at the top of this range. 3. Sweet chocolate contains 15-34% cocoa (15% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids. It is sometimes also marketed as ""dark chocolate,"" even though it has a much lower percentage of cocoa solids than bittersweet, which can cause consumers, in such cases, to purchase a product with less cocoa in it than they realized they were getting. Everything else besides the cocoa and milk solids is essentially sugar. 4. Milk chocolate is only required to have a minimum of 10% cocoa, a minimum of 12% milk solids and 3.39% milk fat. The rest is sugar and milk. The ingredients of this particular dark-chocolate bar, per the package, include: Chocolate Fat (pure chocolate contains a very healthy saturated fat called cocoa butter) Sugar Fiber (pure chocolate is also rich in fiber) Protein (pure chocolate contains some protein) Vanilla People who are allergic to nuts (including peanuts and tree nuts), soy, and milk should not eat this product since it is manufactured with the same equipment that processes those things and traces could be in this chocolate. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Tasty sour tea!,5,"I am also trying out hibiscus tea because I have read that there are clinical trials that show hibiscus lowers blood pressure. I'm not sure how strong hibiscus tea is ""supposed"" to be, but about 10 petals in a coffee mug works for me. The tea produced is very strong and exceptionally sour which, personally, I love. I would say it's similar in taste to rhubarb which I also love. You can add a sugar or sugar alternative if you want, but I say it tastes great straight. I was expecting this to be a finely chopped powder, but as others have said, these are full petals (see my user added image). You don't really need to buy a tea strainer for this. I use a bombilla sometimes, Steel Spring Bombilla 1 Count , but really, it isn't necessary. Which is convenient for those of us who get lazy. Put petals in coffee mug, pour in water, microwave for 1:30, voila! Just throw away or eat petals when finished. (They have a nice texture to them after they've steeped for a few minutes). Other notes: the tea produced is a very deep and pretty magenta. If it spills on something white, like for example my shirt, it turns into an indigo stain. Would probably be good for and all-natural tie-dye. From Wikipedia: ""A study published in the Journal of Human Hypertension has shown that drinking hibiscus tea can reduce high blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes. The study results showed the average systolic blood pressure for those drinking hibiscus tea decreased from 134.8 mmHg (17.97 kPa) at the beginning of the study to 112.7 mmHg (15.03 kPa) at the end of the study, one month later.[5] This is consistent with its supposed role as a diuretic."" …",64 out of 66 users found this review helpful

 Great Taste,5,"This gelatin tastes NOTHING like the Knox or other varieties you can find in the grocery stores and this is a good thing since those taste like sludge for the most part, to be polite. I drink one tablespoon dissolved in hot water to make a tea, twice a day. The taste is somewhere between neutral and pleasantly rich but in an extremely subtle way. I really enjoy drinking it in my teas unsweetened, although my housemates think I'm a freak for doing it, not that me filling the freezer with animal bones and organs and bee pollen and fermenting random stuff on the counter doesn't make me a freak already. I originally bought this as a way to get more protein after reading what I now know was a quite quackery-laden blog post. Gelatin is NOT a complete protein. It's pretty much just proline and glycine, and has no tryptophan. So don't order for this purpose. However, if you're ordering to help your joints, skin, hair, cellulite, nails, etc. I think that this is the best you can buy. I've been using it to get rid of cellulite (since it runs in my family) and it's a lot easier than constantly boiling bones and less gross than drinking bone broth at 7 am in the middle of the summer. And after doing this for a few weeks, my booty/thighs are looking shaa-weet! It's pretty crazy actually; I love this stuff. …",45 out of 45 users found this review helpful
 Read the ingredients!,1,"I think the ratings for Mori-Nu Tofu would not be so high if more people were actually aware of what's in it. Mori-Nu's tofu contains soy protein isolate, a highly processed form of soy. As a busy student cooking for myself most nights, I'm always looking for grocery products that will make putting dinner on the table more convenient. But while I was intrigued by the shelf-stability of Mori-Nu Tofu, I'm definitely not counting on it as a staple-- Tofu is considered healthy because it is a fermented soy product, but the soy protein isolate in Mori-Nu's tofu puts it in the category of processed soy, the kind that will mess with your endocrine system if consumed it regularly. This means if you're eating tofu for the health benefits, you may as well look elsewhere. What I've learned is that most tofus packed in water have expiry dates two months ahead (unopened) so you'll only need to replenish your supply every 1 1/2-2 months. Sure, this would save me space in the fridge and I could stock up on a year's worth of tofu if I really wanted to (and I might want to, but a year's worth of tofu is hardly a necessity). But the bottom line is I'm just unwilling to make this highly processed food a staple, particularly when versions that are truly healthy are readily available. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS,1,"We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb. …",8 out of 12 users found this review helpful

This is obviously a contradiction to many, if not most vegans. I write this as an FYI to those wanting to find a vegan sauce. My daughter just turned vegan and needs an stir fry sauce without sugar or with organic sugar or other sweetener, so I felt I was almost tricked into buying this, but she would have been upset.

 The real stuff.  Shark brand Sriracha loses the artifical qualities of Huey Fong but has all the fire and yum.,5,"I've been a rabid fan of Huey Fong Sriracha sauce for years, so when I saw authentic Thai Sriracha sauce here on Superstore my interest was piqued. I wasn't disappointed. Shark brand Sriracha sauce really does come from Thailand and it really is sriracha sauce. It's the same hot chili loaded with garlic and yummy sweetness - but there are plenty of differences. Where Huey Fong is dark almost crimson red (and looks a tad fake), Shark brand is brick tomato red and clearly looks natural. Huey Fong lists preservatives, Shark does not. Unlike Huey Fong, Shark is freely runny and comes in a glass (not plastic) bottle without a flow limiting top (so watch out!) Tasting notes: Shark is hot, sweet, and garlicky. Compared to Huey Fong it is less sweet, with a more open tomato-like flavor component. Vinegar is a more noticeable flavor element with Shark brand. The texture is looser; and the product separates more in the fridge (and, yes, it requires refrigeration) and requires that the bottle be shaken before use if it's sitting for more than a week. Is Shark yummy? Yes - it's probably the second best hot sauce I've tried. Is Huey Fong yummier? Yes, in my opinion Huey Fong's added sweetness and thickness and less vinegar taste is more yummy - but it's not a slam dunk. Shark brand feels more real, more homemade, and more authentic (as it probably is). Huey Fong has preservatives and has a color and texture that are a tad artificial. I find myself going back and forth. On top of a burrito I prefer Huey Fong. In soup I prefer Shark. I certainly do not regret having this stuff. Highly recommended for the sriracha obsessed. FYI - full ingredient list: ""Chillie"" 35%, Water 25%, Sugar 20%, Garlic 10%, Salt 5%, Vinegar 5%. Sounds like you could almost make it at home. Manufacturer: Kosol-Ampa Co. LTD.

 Ekobrew Washer Hack,4,"When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good. I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer. If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past. The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer. The washer I used is rubber, 1/16"" thick, 5/32"" inside diameter, and 3/8"" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493. …",232 out of 235 users found this review helpful

" Not exactly like traditional potato chips, but a great substitute",5,"One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips. I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips. In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip. This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind. I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco. I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area. Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any. I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Superstore in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me. They are definitely worth the money. I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips. The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips. I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do. Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them. As for the portion size, it's pretty generous. For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors. I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next. …",73 out of 77 users found this review helpful

 They changed the Chips now they taste horrible,1,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy. I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan. About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket. I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it. After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to. They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed. So I e-mailed Kettle with the following: ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering."" I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag. This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks. Please let me know if I can be of any more help."" Well the next bag was good. Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost. I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company. So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle. Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand. increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.

However, over the last few months (late 2007) something has changed. My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it. Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped. I tried another bag last week-- same results. Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months. No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners. Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address. I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems. I've changed my dogs to Eagle Pack Holistic Selects. It's more expensive, but they are back to their old selves-- healthy, no digestive troubles, and great coats. …",15 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Loved it for a while....,3,"I got the AeroGarden back in November, and had great luck with the Salad Greens kit. I ordered another Salad Greens kit, and as soon as I planted it, the pump got REALLY loud. So loud you can't be in the same room with the thing and hope to get anything done that requires concentration (I'm a grad student and the AeroGarden has become my personal study albatross). Sooooo...thinking I needed to clean out the roots a bit better, I took it apart and went through the whole sanitation process, preparing the garden for my third planting. As soon as I plugged it back in, the pump roared to life and once again my living room was filled with a lovely, deep buzzing/humming sound. Other posters are spot-on about customer service - you simply cannot get through to these people. I've been on hold for 20 minutes and more before giving up each time - I'm hoping they'll send me a new pump, but I need to actually HEAR from a real person. It's great that they're nice and all - hey, we'd all be nice if we rarely actually talked to anyone! UPDATE: I sent one email and they responded within hours with an offer to send out a new pump, so my opinion of customer service has changed considerably - I'll update this review when I get the pump to let everyone know if that fixed the noise problem FINAL UPDATE: Yes, the new pump fixed the noise problem *and* customer service has gotten a LOT better. I've phoned a couple of times and got a live person, quickly, who was extremely helpful. Looks like the kinks are worked out from the original problems and I now wouldn't hesitate to pick another one of these gardens up. …",38 out of 40 users found this review helpful

 WARNING:  Please read before feeding,1,"WARNING: I use to feed my dogs Orijen 75% protein but the last few months my dogs have had really bad diarrhea. We thought one would need IV fluids because he was getting dehydrated. I looked at the bag and saw they now changed to 80% protein and now use sodium selenite which I would never buy a food with this ingredient. Instead of getting better they are getting worse. 80% protein is a lot for a non working dog. And now with the recall, I have to look for another brand of dog food with selenium yeast, no ethoxyquin, no BHT etc. Also, the company that once was great in customer service now refuses to answer e-mail questions. What are they hiding. This use to be a good quality dog food that I use to recommend to everyone.

 Soooo Glad I Found These,5,"Received these and made a stir fry dish the same night. Noodles have a texture all their own and I LOVE them (husband likes them, too).

 Disappointed,2,"The basket I received did not contain all of the items as described/pictured. It did not contain the Camembert cheese, but instead a block of orange garlic cheese. It also contained water crackers instead of the sesame crackers. It did not contain the butter toffee popcorn or Ghiradelli chocolates at all. It did contain a package of two tea bags which is not pictured or mentioned. Also what is pictured, but not described is a box with a wafer in it. Make note the product features and product description slightly differ. The description mentions Mrs. Prindables caramel confections which the basket also did not contain. The basket looked nice, but I would say it is overpriced for what I received. Granted it is a small/cheaper basket, but it feels like it is filled with larger boxes with not much product. I gave this to my dad and when he opened the box of wafers it only contained one. The box of toffee only contained two. The truffle box is smaller/different than the one featured and looks like it contains only one or two pieces. The Camembert cheese pictured looks larger, but the garlic cheese that came in it was a smaller 6 oz piece without the fancy box.

Then I read a review on here about Vermont having tougher standards for maple syrup. As in something about not allowing other sweeteners or something, don't remember exactly.

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Warning: Contains Menadione,1,"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex. Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance. Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption. A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997. Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells. Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats. …",20 out of 23 users found this review helpful

 This one supplement has changed my life!!!!!,5,"I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.) None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life. That is, until Natural Calm. This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically! Here are the things this supplement has helped with: Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night. Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations. Mood--- Made me generally happier. Decreased muscle cramping and soreness. Improved gums and teeth. Improved hair loss. Improved digestion and transit time. Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too! But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really. There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Superstore if you want more science of magnesium.) I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement. If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want. Here's wishing you great health! …",37 out of 46 users found this review helpful

 Energy booster!,5,"So let's be honest. I have severe anxiety and depression issues which has gone on my whole life. I have been prescribed dozens of different meds to help with it but nothing has. Also, I don't have insurance so I literally put out hundreds a month to try new drugs that didn't help. More importantly, the side effects were sometimes as bad or worse than my symptoms. I have also tried other natural cures that didn't help. Several of my friends suggested I smoke hemp as a natural cure. I'm not against it but I'm not a smoker and I've had professional jobs where I could be tested, anyway. So I thought, let's check Superstore and see what natural hemp products are available. First I tried hemp powder, which I also reviewed if you're interested, and it tasted like sand. It will take me all year to be able to finish the 3 lb bag and that's if I ever do. Then I tried this. I'm very honest in my reviews so I wouldn't recommend this if it didn't truly help. It's not a placebo-effect thing, either. I have tried too many meds for that to even be a possibility, trust me. The one thing I can tell you for certain is within the first week it greatly and noticeably increased my energy levels. I have done more around the house in the past few months than I've done in the past few years. I have gone through 2 subscriptions of this and the energy hasn't gone away. I am a big and tall person so I take 4 in the morning and 4 at night, usually. Anyone who has depression/anxiety issues knows that sometimes you barely feel like getting out of bed most days. You get a heavy feeling like there's lead in your veins. If you've been through it then you understand what I'm talking about. I can say with 100% honesty that it has given me way more energy and it has helped with that heavy feeling. Can I guarantee it will work? No. My aunt and mom tried a couple just one time and they didn't notice any difference. But it has sure worked for me taking it daily. What I can tell you is that you should at least try it. If it doesn't help, just don't buy it again. But it is sure worth a try because it might help you as much as it has me. I will take this supplement for the rest of my life, as far as I'm concerned. That's how much it has helped. I hope it works for you, too. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

Please see attached for an example of test results for our treats; I have attached one of our VITALITY(tm) products that were tested recently. Our material suppliers are certified clean and clear of any contaminants. If raw ingredients do not meet their specifications and pass safety tests, then the ingredient is rejected immediately and never enters our processing facilities. Moreover, we strive to use products from suppliers that treat their animals humanely. Please see attached for an image of our chickens in their barn. I do not know of a reliable site that describes the process. Please know that we honestly believe that pets are family too and we feed our products to our own pets regularly. Again, we test product from each batch that is produced and have never had our results come back positive for ANY harmful ingredients. Please don't hesitate to contact me with ANY questions. Thank You, Jeff Jeff Haluck Marketing Assistant …",30 out of 35 users found this review helpful

 A little known secret...,3,"IF (and that's a big if) you can get your cat to like this kind of litter, it's great. You have to mix clay and the pine pellets together for quite some time before they adjust. 2 of my 3 cats like it, and thankfully the third cat would prefer to go outside. Well, Feline Pine is a great concept, but it is soooo much cheaper to go to a feed store and buy a 40 lb bag of HORSE BEDDING. It is the same exact stuff, tightly compacted pine pellets. I was using Feline Pine for a few months before my coworker suggested I go buy horse bedding instead. Feline Pine: 20 lbs for $15 OR horse bedding: 40 lbs for $6. It works exactly the same and lasts just as long. The only difference is the Feline Pine has a stronger pine smell. Save yourself some money and go to the feed store. …",69 out of 72 users found this review helpful
 My 12 Yr Old Diabetic Cat acts like a Kitten Again!,5,"My female cat who just was turning 12 this summer lost the fuction/strength of her back legs and she was hopping around (think bunny rabbit); I took her to the vet expecting to be told horrible news and have to put her down...nope. She had diabetes! I had no idea that was a symptom of high blood sugar and high triglycerides in cats. She was put on Insulin injections 2 x a day and I was told to stay away from dry cat food (the Vet also told me that diabetes in cats is a MAN CAUSED DISEASE! with all the by products, and grains and junk they put in those foods as fillers) and stick with a high protein low carb canned food twice a day. We have another cat, a 5 yr old non diabetic male...so this meant his diet had to change as well. He was not happy when I took away all dry food. And slowly over time, my 12 yr old started to sit at the dish more looking at me as to be saying...""sure i can walk but i'm starving lady!"" After about a month of insulin injections and their new food routine, my 12 yr old started to regain strength in her back legs and was back up to walking on her toes most of the time, but still had a very hard time jumping on furniture or on the window sill. I decided to add back the dry food just a small amt. a day and leave it out so they could graze when they were used to. My mom told me about this brand, she feeds it to her dogs, and said she thought they had a cat brand that didn't have any grains in it. I was hesitant b/c of the price and some of the feedback on other petfood sites suggested their cats hated it or it was ""too strong"" for them, whatever that means. Well, let me tell you...2 days later, my 12 yr old diabetic cat was RUNNING! I am not kidding. She is 100% up on her toes all of the time, running, jumping back up on the couch and bed like she always used to as a younger cat, loves to play ""fight"" with her younger brother cat. The difference is amazing. My 5 yr old male cat enjoys the food very much, and while I did try the canned variety that Blue Buffalo has to offer, they were not diggin it at all, so we returned back to the cheaper canned food they like and they get a 1/2 cup of the Blue Buffalo Wilderness Dry in a bowl each morning and they just have a nibble here and there which keeps them both very happy. Their coats have never been fluffier and softer. My female cat has never had soft or fun to pet fur; but suddenly I have noticed over the past week her hair seems fluffy and full and the softest it has ever been. My male cat has always been soft and fluffy, I didn't think his could get any softer, but it has! I'm not saying that Blue Buffalo was a miracle that suddenly made my 12 yr old diabetic cat walk again, I realize that a change in food and insulin was a big part of that, but this definatly made a difference in her quality of life and it happened fast! It is pricey, but have you ever looked at the back of the ingredients list of other dry cat foods??? RIDICULOUS! THis brand is totally worth it. ESp since they are getting such a little amt. each day, the large bag will last at least a month. I cannot say enough good things about this brand of food and the fact they actually sell something without grain and gluten. Cats do not need that junk!!!!!! I should also add that both cats seem to have nice soft, thick coats and are maintaining their weight. My diabetic has always been obese topping off at 14 lbs, she lost 2 lbs over the past few years the Vet says prob the first symptom of her diabetes; she has went up to 13 1/2 lbs and has stayed there; which was a little of a concern when adding in this food; it is high in calories, but with all that running she now is doing up our 17 steps daily, she must be burning it off :) Shop around for the price, I buy it in a certain well known pet store for about half of this price. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 THIS STUFF IS INCREDIBLE!!!,5,"This is amazing. I like it better than all other coconut oils. Of course it tastes like coconut. I don't want to use oils that are so overly processed and refined that they taste like ""nothing"". I don't understand why the coconut flavor bothers some people. If you don't like coconut, find a different oil. You can use this for grilling, frying, baking, sauteeing, greasing & flouring a cake pan, and all other places that you'd use butter or a Crisco-type product. Just be careful on the baking because this melts at a low temperature. It is amazing as a skin softener, a hair conditioner, a leave in hot oil treatment, make-up remover, eyelash conditioner/glosser, shaving ""cream"", lip softener, cuticle oil, nail conditioner, bath oil, after bath oil, massage oil (add a few drops of essential oil if you wish), etc. Speaking of massage oil, this is an excellent product for ""adult activities"" . . . as a perk it is definitely edible. If you have dry feet, slather this on, rub it in, wrap your feet with plastic wrap, cover with socks, and go to bed. In the morning your feet will feel nice and soft. This can be used on leather such as shoes, jackets, and purses. Because it's clear, you can use it on leather products that have decorative stitching that you can't cover with regular colored polish. (In fact, I just bent over and put coconut oil on my black leather shoes with my fingers . . . the only clean up needed was to rub my hands together.) I've even used it on my wood furniture to obtain the same results as furniture oils. I have used it to grease hinges and mechanical parts. I have heard that you can use it to add lustre to pearls but I'm too chicken to try it on my good stuff. I know people that have used it as a laxative (in large quantities) and a diet aid. When I eat about a T. a day my skin is softer and my wrinkles are less noticable. I keep finding new uses. I'm sure you'll find some, too. …",68 out of 69 users found this review helpful

 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 If it's too good to be true . . .,4,". . . it probably is. If you can get past the big number 5 on the front and look at the nutritional information, you'll see that each 2 oz serving contains 41g of carbohydrates like most other pastas. I don't buy into the ""net carbs"" mentality - a carb is a carb, and I was disappointed that they'd put something so hokey on their packaging without anything to back it up. Some poking around on their website will tell you they have a method of producing the starch so that it gets through undigested, and decided I was going to drink the kool-aid and give it a try. The pasta tastes - like pasta! It has none of the strange taste or texture you'd find with a whole grain variety. You wouldn't be able to detect any difference if you tasted it next to any other brand. Do I really think I'm only getting 5g of carbs per serving? No. But it tastes normal and it can't be any worse than regulary pasta so I'm going to keep buying it just in case they're right. There's no reason not to. …",5 out of 13 users found this review helpful

So I just figured that the oil Mario uses is probably pretty good, I found it online a few years ago and have ordered it ever since, it truly is awesome, I cook with it, fry in it, make dressings and whatnot, it really is WAY better than the standard EV's you find in supermarkets... …",41 out of 42 users found this review helpful

I thought it would be like Similac's new packaging (with the plastic container) but Enfamil has a bag inside to keep the formula fresh. Normally when I scoop out the formula, I like to shake it off to make the scoop even out. It's really difficult to shake out the formula from the bag and I have to shove my hand in the bag to get to the formula (especially when it's getting low), then my hand gets powder all over it. I haven't dumped the formula directly in the container because I want it to stay fresh, so scooping out formula is now a messier task. It takes a little longer too (when I have a screaming baby, I don't want scooping out formula to slow me down).

 A Culinary Rainbow in Eden's Sea Breeze Garden,5,"This recently redeemed saturated fat is an unusually elegant offering. Liquid above 78 degrees, when below that temperature this exotic substance solidifies into a white, wax-like, creamy fat which for my tastes is even more versatile, flavorful, and healthful in culinary concoctions than coconut milk [though I LOVE everything about coconut]. Since other reviews have effectively detailed health benefits, varieties of uses, and comparisons of brands, I'll work another angle and design a recipe specifically for the assets of this oil as my experience with it conjures... Imagine melting this creamy solid as you might do with dry chunks of fresh, unsalted butter dropped easily into a chef's stainless steel [or cast iron] skillet. After the coconut lard has melted, coating the pan with its clear, wavering liquid radiating from mildly searing heat [not over 350 degrees], carefully sizzle in a half-dozen large, cleaned prawns and a fresh salmon steak. Prior to hitting the pan, the sea morsels should have been eased from a state of cool moisture into a warmer, drier presentation, to avoid spattering when placed into the heated oil, and to avoid cooling the oil to a temperature too low for an immediate, light searing to occur on the surface of the ocean-plumped, sweet-pink edibles. Think of the sweet, paradise-rich flavor of coconut, coating a crisp, caramelized surface onto the salty tang of the shrimp and salmon meats... [Your mouth might be watering now. Mine is!] Put on a CD with the happy 40's tune of & Coca Cola sending dancing notes around your stove-top, putting an upbeat rhythm into your head ... from down in Trinidad. [Your feet will be making up their own motions now.] Crack a bit of sea salt crystal over the hissing ocean treats. Overlap that seasoning with cleaned, halved garlic cloves dropped into the skillet, followed by large sprigs of fresh dill, fennel stalks, and a half-cup of shelled, dark walnut meats. After the pan's contents have been seared golden on all main sides, pour in about a cup of dry white wine [enough liquid to retain itself without simmering away into steam, but not so much as to smother the meats and dissolve the top layer of dark, caramelized coating]. Squeeze a fresh lime into the steaming liquid in the pan, followed by a splash or two of quality blackberry juice and a sliced, fresh, ripe peach [which will stew into the concoction, coalescing into an almost unimaginable flavor of sweet, sour highlights held by a texture of pulpy fruit]. Simmer and swish the heavenly blend maybe a minute, taking care to heat all participants but not overcook the shrimp or salmon. Crack fresh black pepper over the brew in the skillet, then serve onto a large, multi-colored, festive plate, over a mound of Quinoa [see my review Eco Fair Trade White Quinoa from Bolivia, 16-Ounce Boxes ] which has been cooked, then warmly toasted in Macadamia Nut Oil [see my review of Macadamia Nut Oil 16 fl.oz] with garlic bits and chives, adding fresh mint as a last touch. Garnish the presentation of Quinoa, Prawns, and salmon steak with sugar snap peas which have been sauteed in almond oil [see my review of Foods Sweet Almond Oil, Edible, 16 ounce ] with slivers of red onion, angle-sliced celery, toasted, halved almonds, and sprigs of fresh cilantro. There you have a culinary rainbow, from a Shelnutt dreaming in Eden's Sea Breeze Garden. Before taking your first, saliva-rich bite, with your ""Rum & Coca Cola"" CD still dancing through the air waves in your gorgeous, eat-in, gourmet kitchen, be sure to have your KINDLE to read at the table, with a story ready which will rhythm your thoughts into the 50's, when songs from the 40's were still dancing in the minds of the cooks of the world, COAL & COCA-COLA, a short, true story with photos, about a bakery opened in that vintage era.

 Love it!,5,"I have a 8.5 month old Aussie mix. She's about 42 lbs now. This food is magic!! I love it! She's never been ""food motivated"" and so she's always been a little reluctant to eat her kibble, but she honestly LIKES this stuff. She'll do tricks for it like it is a treat. More importantly, her poop is GREAT on this kibble. Finally, it's easy to pick up! This food is a godsend. We've previously tried Innova EVO, California Natural Lamb and Rice Puppy and Adult, and Canidae All Life Stages. Innova EVO gave her the runs, but she was a new puppy. (The pet food store said EVO was rich enough for puppies. My vet disagreed.) California Natural seemed better, but her poop was always so soft that it was messy to pick up, and she never really liked it. She liked the taste of Canidae better - so much so that she would pick it out when I mixed it with the Lamb and Rice. However, her poop didn't really improve until we shifted to Orijen. Magic. This stuff is magic, I say. Besides being the magic food for my dog, it's also made in Canada with almost all Canadian ingredients. From what I've read, they get rice from California and Lamb from New Zealand, but otherwise -- everything comes from farms in and around Alberta. No food recalls on this brand!

" I wouldn't cook with it, but it may have medicinal applications",3,"I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that. I tried it in split pea soup that has a pretty strong aroma of its own, and found it quite unworkable. Also, coconut ""oil"" is one of the most saturated fats in nature, so I'd rather just use butter for most things since it is not nearly as saturated. Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it. You cannot ""eat it out of the jar"" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard.

" Average chocolate, strong fillings",3,"These are definitely ""mid-range"" chocolates, not quite as good as Godiva or See's. If you're used to low-end chocolates like Fannie May or Russell Stover, you'll probably find these to be very good. However, if you're used to very good chocolates like La Maison du Chocolat, you'll be sorely disappointed. I found the chocolate to have unexceptional flavor and a somewhat waxy texture. The fillings were mostly very sweet or alcoholic, which is a common practice to cover up mediocre chocolate. I guess they're a good value compared to Godiva, although I think See's Candies has an even better value. Don't expect Leonidas to compare to a high-end chocolatier. …",9 out of 20 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 All Japanese Sesame Oil is NOT the same!,2,"I tried this for the first time because my favorite sesame oil (Kadoya) wasn't available. I figured all Japanese sesame oils are more or less the same. I was dead wrong. What a disappointment! This oil is either watered-down or not processed properly. I will never order it again, unless there is a world wide shortage of sesame oil. Stick with Kadoya 56 oz if you can get it. It is rich in flavor and the real thing. …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Love this product,5,"Our 10 year old lab mix started having problemswith his hip joints. He has always been an active dog and watching him lay around and not want to interact was hard to see. Initially our vet gave us Rimadyl to get him through the acute phase, but it is a bit pricey and I know that it is hard on their stomach and kidneys. I searched the internet and read reviews for several days, each time my reasearch led me back to this product. Off I went to the local pet supply store to get this treat. When I opened the bag I thought for sure that my dog would turn his nose up at them, they smell awful....well my husband now calls these ""doggie crack"", our dog LOVES these treats. As soon as he sees the bag he RUNS to get his snack. Yep RUNS. Not only am I giving him something he loves but something that has helped him with mobility. I followed directions I found at a vets website to double the dose for several weeks and then give a maintenance dose of glucosamine after that....what a difference!!! Shop around as I only purchase these at the local store if I make a mistake and run out! There is quite a difference in price from stores to online. I am completely sold on this product and have now started purchasing some of their other treats and products as well!! Can't go wrong with Zukes! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" Culinary teas bulk matcha vs. ""tea ceremony quality"" matcha",4,"I am new to matcha drinking, so was somewhat concerned re: customer comments Culinary Teas matcha being ""brown"" (i.e. a not the correct bright green color). I had only tried Starbucks Matcha (PLEASE BE ADVISED - it is very tasty, but probably because the number one ingredient on the label is sugar). Also, a pound of Starbucks Matcha (as sold on a popular auction site) costs about the same as a pound of Culinary Teas bulk Matcha)...so you are getting far less of the expensive and healthful green tea powder and more sugar (the Starbucks product is somehow micronized so it does mix into solution much easier than a less processed pure tea powder). The teaspoon on the right is Teavana (at $16 for 30 grams - thats 2 Tbsp) they said it was the highest ""tea ceremony"" quality matcha. The teaspoon on the left is the bulk (1 lb, silver bag) CT product. Photo taken without a flash and not retouched so actual colors show. CT matcha is slightly less brilliant green. I mixed exact quantities (1/2 tsp) of matcha in 8 oz of liquid with exact quantities of sweetener (a blend of xylitol and stevia that I am experimenting with). The CT matcha tastes slightly less ""green"" and slightly more bitter than the Teavana, but I did the math ( a pound of CT would cost $240 at the Teavana $16 per 30 g cost) - so I am very happy with my CT purchase. Will use the smaller container for my ""working"" supply, freeze the rest and use as needed. Am finding Matcha to be a great substitute for my ""too much coffee"" habit and prefer the less instantaneous (but prolonged) energy boost it gives - not too mention alkalizing instead of acidifying, ECGC, and possible metabolism boosting effect. PS Most Starbucks barristas do not know the Matcha powder contains sugar, so they will tell you the are not adding any. As consumers, we need to ask companies to STOP ADDING SUGAR (in whatever processed form it takes) to everything they make. …",58 out of 60 users found this review helpful
 Goooood stuff,5,All of your yeast breads will be improved by using gluten. I add two teaspoons for a one pound loaf. Even if you use bread flour add the gluten. I keep mine in the freezer because it will go rancid. But it seems to stay good in freezer -- never had any go bad since I've been freezing it. Caution: if you spill some in the sink or wipe up with a wet rag you have a huge sticky mess. Try not to spill it. …,32 out of 32 users found this review helpful

 Recommended!,5,"Really no difference in the flavor than regular pancake mix. My children ate it with no problems and said it tasted the same as regular. Great for my daughter that's allergic to wheat! Give it a try. I paid $6.89 for just one at the local health food store. This is a much better deal! I wanted to add that I posted this description under Pamela's Pancake mix. I have also used the Chocolate cake mix and the bread mix. Since this is posted under all 3 for some reason I will comment on those too. The Bread mix is very good. It does take a little tweaking, maybe it's my bread machine. It is very good, everyone in the family likes it. We have made pizza crust out of it for my little girl and she loves it. We have made the cookies from the pancake mix and she loves them, we add cinnamon and sugar to them before baking. The Chocolate Cake mix is very good, it is more of a dark chocolate than a milk chocolate. We make cupcakes out of them and freeze them. Nice and fluffy. She loves them too. All in all I would say that if you can't have wheat, Pamela's products are the best choice for flavor and texture. Don't buy that already made bread. It was awful, sorry I don't remember the brand but Superstore sells it. …",24 out of 29 users found this review helpful
 Who Needs Belly-Fattening Sugar?!,5,"The phrase 'too good to be true' is put to the test on this product. A 1/4 cup of this clear syrup is only 35 calories! There is absolutely no after taste that clues you in that this is anything but real sugar.

" short on ingredients, long on utter deliciousness",5,"These are my favorite variety of Larabar. If you like gingerbread (not gingersnaps or gingerbread cookies, mind you -- actual gingerbread, the kind that you can eat by the slice) than I am willing to bet that you will love these bars as much as I do. The taste is exactly like that of freshly baked gingerbread; the texture is moist like gingerbread but crunchy because of the nuts the bar contains. The crunchiness, in my opinion, doesn't detract a whit from the overall fabulousness of these bars -- in fact, I would say it adds to it. Finally (and this is true of all Larabars) the stunning brevity of the ingredient list bears noting. Larabars contain no added sugar, no artificial flavoring or coloring, and no preservatives. All of the sweetness and flavor (and there is just enough of the former and plenty of the latter) come from wholly natural, healthful sources. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Get these if need a POWERFUL LAXATIVE,1,"I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch. They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects. Within about 7 hours after eating these my stomach started feeling awkward. Shortly after I started having cramps and severe watery diarrhea several times throughout the evening and late night. Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum. The package I purchased said cellulose gum on the ingredients list, but on the web sites it is listed as carboxymethylcellulose. You will find they are synonyms if you Google them. All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping. If you look up this ingredient, or look it up along with ""side effects"" you will find it is undigestible and can cause side effects such as bloating and diarrhea. Never again. All I can say is please post a review if this happened to you to others are forewarned! …",15 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Great Cereal,4,"If you are looking for a healthy, good tasting cereal you should try Kashi's GOLEAN Crunch. Compared to most healthy (particularly high protein and high fiber) cereals, it has a higher protein and fiber content per serving. As important, it tastes good. Its taste obviously cannot compare to some sugar filled normal cereal, but as health cereals go, this one is a keeper. I eat it 3-4 days a week and have done so for over a year and I still like it! Just note that you may want to buy one box from your local grocery store before buying a six pack from Superstore just to make sure you like it. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
