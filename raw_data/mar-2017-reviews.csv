 Sojos almost killed my dog,1,"My dog, a 3-year-old chocolate lab with no history of allergies, had a severe allergic reaction to Sojos and required weeks of treatment to recover from it. I took my dog to two different vets, both of whom said the change in his food was almost certainly the cause of the illness. When I took a closer look at the remaining Sojos food I found that it contained bits of wood, twine and bulap sack material. When I changed my dog back to his old food, the allergy went away. Sojos refused to admit that their food was the cause of my dog's illness, and refused to refund even the money I had paid them for the food, let alone reimburse me for over the over $700 I spent for veterinary care. Don't risk your dog's health with Sojos. If you want to make home-cooked food, ask your vet for a recipe. …",9 out of 14 users found this review helpful

We freeze the whole can in Ice cube trays and give her one a day. She loves it. She seemed to come alive again. Shaking it in the can dosen't mix it well.

 Gold standard...Years of research on my part...,5,"When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my ""baby"" each day. Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life... I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption. I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me) At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud. Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods. The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label. Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this! Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic. I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about. Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out... (p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them! But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!) So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.) Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest... if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal. This is hard to find. So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet. He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!) I, personally, have helped friends CURE ""health"" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept ""treating"" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and ""cured"" them! Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both. I am a raving fan. and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it. …",119 out of 120 users found this review helpful

 Amazing Cat Food,5,"I ordered the Ennova Evo Cat Food at the recommendation of our vetrinarian. We have 2 cats, both grand old ladies, and one had developed diabetes in the last 6 months.

 Like it alot,5,"When I asked what the main ingrediant in this product was I was told it was vinegar. My grandmother used to use vinegar to clean fruits and it works great, but it has a strong smell and often that smell can stick to the surface of the fruit. Fit has no unpleasant scent and it does a great job. You can see how much more dirt comes off than when just using water. Plus it's kosher which is a plus for the times when I have my 2 modern orthodox jewish friends and their kids over. One reviewer says the plastic bowl has BPA. As someone who tries to avoid BPA plastics for anything that handles my food I tried to verify this. The bottom of the white bowl has a 5 recycling number so it looks like this collander is BPA free. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 A Very Good Snack Chip,4,"Flavor is good, not excellent. I really like these but I have to stay accurate here with the review. They are very good but not the best. I guess there are some limits you get from staying healthy. As a health snack I'd give them 5 stars though. Secondly, they leave almost no oil residue in your mouth. So you don't have to wash them down with any strong soda to cut the film off of your tongue. And let's face it, a healthy snack is not healthy if you have to use some unhealthy drink to wash it down. All in all, these are one of my favorite healthy snacks. Very good. …",17 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 No worries about plastic leaching,5,"I wrote this to ease the worries of those who read some of the lower starred reviews complaining about the plastic container and possible ""leaching"" of harmful byproducts into the oil. Turn your Nutiva jar upside down and read inside the little recycle triangle. See the little ""1"" symbol and the PETE written under it? That's a good plastic: ""#1 is Polyethylene Terephthalate, also marked as PET or PETE. Companies normally use this plastic for various beverage containers such as water, soft drinks, and sport drinks. You can also find this plastic for ketchup, peanut butter, salad dressings, jellies, and various other condiments. This plastic is known as one of the ""good"" plastics since it is not known to leach, or gradually penetrate, chemicals into the products it houses."" [...] Also, don't worry about the clear container--coconut oil is highly resistant to becoming rancid from heat/light, unlike olive, corn, and other oils. Enjoy. …",59 out of 61 users found this review helpful
 Natural Calm Magnesium,5,"I have used this product before in the calcium/magnesium blend. It was suppose to be tasteless. It wasn't. It tastes awful. This lemon-raspberry tastes okay and the product is more reactive when the hot water is added. I was medically advised to take my magnesium in this form because of slipped disks in my back. This is only one piece of my back program however I can attest to the efficacy of the product. My disks are no longer slipped. It has helped me to heal. A bonus benefit for me is that taking the magnesium in this form has stopped the migraines that I have had for 36 years of my life. I have learned that if a headache begins that I need a dose of Natural Calm. I was dealing with a magnesium deficiency. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with muscle or joint issues, migraines,and back issues.

 Less plastic and better taste? Yes please!,5,"These do not look like regular K-cups. And perhaps they won't keep as long because the bottom looks like it's made of rounded cloth, kind of like a tea bag. But they fit Keurig machines just fine, are less expensive, and most importantly I think this coffee tastes better than the coffee in plastic K-cups. I actually prefer the fact that the bottom is not made of plastic. I never liked the idea that my hot coffee was being strained through a plastic cup.

 worst feeling ever!,1,"I decided to try 5 hour energy after it was recommended to me by my Dad. I have been drinking ""Go Girls"" for a while and I loved them. I wanted to try the 5 hour energy because the ""Go Girls"" kept me up at night. First of all, I understand first hand that this drink affects people differently. Like I said my Dad loves it and swears by it, myself, not so much. I decided to drink only half the bottle to start with, so it wouldn't be too overwhelming. But, even with half the bottle it really messed me up. I felt tired but my heart wouldn't stop racing. It was pounding so much, like I just ran 10 miles in record time! The rest of my body felt awful too. My arms were jittery, yet kinda numb. My legs felt like spaghetti and my stomach felt like it was in knots. Andy even though my body felt like it was all amped up I still felt exhausted and needed to keep putting my head down. I also felt like I just wanted to have a meltdown and cry. It was awful! Be careful if you try this. Take a little bit at a time. For the first time take it when you don't need to do anything or go anywhere. Like I said everyone reacts differently to it. My Dad has these like 2 or 3 times a week and loves it. So try it for yourself, but this was my experience. …",59 out of 81 users found this review helpful
 the Peanut bar,3,"I was looking forward to receiving this order. Almonds, macadamias, and walnuts! Sounded delicious. Then I tried one, and was puzzled. Yes, I could taste some almond, but WOW, the main flavor was PEANUTS. The ingredients list peanuts as the largest amount of nuts. This should be called the Peanut, Almond Bar. If one likes to have the main flavor of a nut bar as peanuts, you will enjoy this. The quality of KIND products I appreciate, as well as the low GI, the natural properties, and having a healthier choice. But honesty in advertising and product would be appreciated. I was disappointed with the deception, and the unexpectedly strong flavor of peanuts, as I purchased it for the nuts I like best, which were supposed to be the main source of nut protein.

 not even close to coconut water!,1,"Coconut water should not be sweetened!!! Actually ""NO SUGAR SHOULD EVER BE ADDED"" sweeting things is an american custom, which ruins the real flavor of coconut water. I lived in Jamaica for 4 years and the bahamas for 2, and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar, its natural. I will stick to buying the brown hard shell coconuts from the supermarket and drink that it's more natural and unaltered. These boxed, caned and packaged coconut water are nasty, i am still yet to try a brand, one of the many that i have tried that will make me wanna buy it. …",2 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 My dog is obsessed with this ball,5,"I went on Superstore looking for some type of dog chew or hard food that would take a long time for my dog to get through, but not so hard that she would give up. She's about 25 pounds, active, but won't play with any toys, and can get down a rawhide in ten minutes. I wanted to find something to cut into her boredom and downtime, but not add a lot of calories. The first day I put it together (took about one minute) and rolled it across the floor. She slowly took after it, investigated, and I went to make dinner. I enjoyed my first dinner at home in about a year that didn't involve my dog staring at me hoping for a handout. She just obsessed over the ball, licking it, and grinding at it with her teeth. After dinner I checked it, and she had made what appeared to be almost negligible progress on the treat. We watched a movie in peace (other than this constant weird panting/slurping noise from the other room). At some point, we realized she had been working on this thing for about three hours. My wife checked her mouth, she was afraid her gums would be bleeding or that her teeth would be ground down to the gums. But no sign of damage. We took it away from her and put it on top of the fridge, and she sat there staring up at the fridge for about half an hour. I'm now on my third day, about three hours a day, still working on the first two discs that fit on opposite sides of the ball. I think maybe she's gotten through about half of it. She's actually penetrated one of the discs with a hole that goes all the way through. She's obsessed. While she has it, she doesn't want to do anything else. If I go to pet her (which she normally loves) she treats me as an irritant keeping her from her ball. Want to walk (normally her favorite thing)? Nope. Maybe after I'm done with this ball in another 16 hours I'll walk. I wonder how long she would be on this ball if I let her? Her jaws must be cramping up. I get the feeling I could give it to her, go to bed, and wake up to see her with bloodshot eyes still working on the ball. It's like crystal meth for dogs. Oh my god, while I'm writing this my dog accidentally rolled the ball under a table and she can't get to it. She looks like an alcoholic staring at a drink they can't reach. I actually feel sorry for her. It's almost 9pm and she's been on this thing since 6pm. Anyway, for my dog, this was exactly what I was looking for. I give it 5 stars. …",24 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Order from E-Pets Galore,1,"Shortly after I wrote my first review I received a phone call from D.J. at E-Pets Galore. We had, what I thought, was a very pleasant conversation. She apologized that I did not receive the correct items I had ordered. D.J. told me that I would receive the items I had originally ordered at the latest by the end of the following week after our conversation. She explained to me that it would not be worth it to send back the items I received in error. I told her I would donate them to a local Animal Rescue compliments of E-Pets Galore. Which I did. I was very happy that D.J. had taken the time to contact me. Our conversation had gone so well that I had decided I would do business with E Pets Galore in the future. I trusted her words. I told D.J. that I would edit my orignal review at Superstore once I received the correct items. It is now 2 1/2 weeks later and I still have not received the items that I had originally ordered and that D.J said I would receive by at the latest the end of last week, April 3, 2009. I have left two messages for her and have not received a return call. Since I have already donated the 25 items to a local Animal Rescue, based on trusting and believing what D.J. said, I have financially lost $91.49.

 Much better options out there,2,"This has been around in Europe for ages - many of my friends have it in London and I can see the apeal of this little steamer/grinder combo gadget however the price in the US is unbelievable!! It makes no sense to buy this when a regular ""adult"" steamer (such as the Black & Decker I reviewed) with a basket 4x the size is $30! I make my own baby food and love having a large basket to cook 4 sweet potatoes at once or a whole bag of baby carrots and freezing the extra portions in ice cube trays. With the Babycook, one would have to steam & puree almost every day -- who has the time? Secondly, with many baby foods, you have to remove the skins after steaming anyway, so it completely defeats the purpose of steaming & pureeing in the same basket. Lastly, when doing some reasearch into this product, I found that it may leech BPA chemicals so please look into this if it is important to you. All in all, I think the Babycook looks adorable and has a cute little name and packaging but if you are a busy, tired mom, do yourself a big favor and get a regular, adult-sized steamer (like the B&D) that can make a month of purreed baby food at a time to freeze and re-heat when needed. The baby will outgrow this machine in a few months and then you are stuck with a $150 useless appliance.

 Stupid idea,1,"So this is sea salt, with added activated charcoal. Now I have nothing against activated charcoal -- it is indeed a miracle product and one of the few 'medicines' I have in the house. But, it will leach minerals and nutrients from what ever it is added to. That is why it is part of the 'universal antidote'. (google this for more info).

" The ""Green Pearl"" of Tea.",5,"Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the ""green pearl"" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself ""home of silk and tea"" for its two primary natural products. The name ""gunpowder"" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot. Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream. …",12 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 SmokeHouse USA?!?  Don't Think So...,1,"I guess if you want to keep raking in the money you have to fudge and mislead folk. That's what SmokeHouse has done by adding 'USA' to their name.

 What a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!,1,"What a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought them in my grocery store because they were on sale. I noticed they were the most expensive ones there so I figured that must be the best there is. How wrong was I. First thing that hit me was how sweet they were. I could barely finish eating. Then I looked at the label and found far too many artificial ingredients. But that's not all. I also bought peach&cream flavor and noticed that peaches and strawberries are strangely similar in taste and shape. After reading a label I found out that they do not even put real strawberries and peaches in the oatmeal. Can you believe that? The most expensive oatmeal on the market and no real fruit. What they do is they put artificially flavored apples in there. Company with such experience in oatmeal making can't afford to give its customers REAL FRUIT? What a shame. I will never buy any of their products. Never!. Oh just to compare what there is available on the market please visit Traders Joe.

 This one supplement has changed my life!!!!!,5,"I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.) None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life. That is, until Natural Calm. This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically! Here are the things this supplement has helped with: Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night. Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations. Mood--- Made me generally happier. Decreased muscle cramping and soreness. Improved gums and teeth. Improved hair loss. Improved digestion and transit time. Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too! But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really. There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Superstore if you want more science of magnesium.) I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement. If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want. Here's wishing you great health! …",37 out of 46 users found this review helpful

 Orijen and small dogs,1,As I write this my 17 lbs Bischon Poodle is in the vet hospital after liver shut down yesterday. Looking for the best food on the market for my dog I researched and read the rave reviews for Orijen all natural food. I decided to place my dog on it. She has been on it for a little over 3 months. She refused to eat the past couple of days. I took her to the vet. The high protein level in Orijen food had put my dog into liver shutdown. I fed her according to recommendations. Protein needed for a small dog is 10-13 % Orijen 39%. No where does Orijen put a warning on their food stating that it could be detrimental to small dogs. I would never recommend this product for a small dog. I would never use it for any dog of mine. The normal level of liver enzymes should have been 70-100. My dogs after being on Orijen for 3 months 750. The risks are too high think carefully and make sure you consult your vet. I would hate to see anyone go through what I've experienced with my dog. …,10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************,2,"First off, the initial arrival: It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat! Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary. Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective; 1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces 2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several. 3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging. In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags. Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's. Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way. But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Superstore charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping). If you wanted to buy using Superstore Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings. An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats …",1 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 The Only Formula that Worked,5,"I think switching formulas is becoming a popular past-time of new parents these days, and when I look back on our experience with our first baby I'm almost ashamed at how frantically we switched her formulas around, searching for an answer to her gassy, colicky behavior. I think in total we tried 7 or 8, from powder to ready-to-feed, hoping that one would be a magical formula that eased her tummy (and our eardrums) during her fussy evening hours. Unfortunately, none of those formulas worked magic. It ended up being that our daughter's belly really did just need to grow & mature before she could readily digest formula, and even the hypo-allergenic ones made little difference in her spit-up or tummy achin' behavior. However, Similac Sensitive was always our fall-back formula because it seemed to cause the least amount of stomach upset, didn't smell as horrible as some of the others, and with the coupons they send out (from StrongMoms) - it was surprisingly affordable for the most part. Strangely, our daughter would only drink ready-to-feed and would never finish a powder-prepared bottle and did seem more gassy after those. So we had to bite our bottom lips and put out the extra money for the liquid, which though expensive, was also very handy on trips and during late night feedings. Similac Sensitive still has a small amount of lactose in it, but it's broken down more than Similac Advance so it's easier to digest. And since it's already sterilized in the bottle, there are none of those new-parent worries over your powdered formula being contaminated or washing your hands before every bottle you make/feed. Trust me, when you're running on 2 hours of sleep, these ""simple pleasures"" can really make a big difference. I also called Similac's customer service on several occasions to ask questions and they were polite and helpful, and even sent coupons! We used Similac Sensitive until our daughter was ready to transition to cow's milk, and although we tried cheaper versions and many other formulas in an attempt to save money, we could never find anything our baby would take as easily as Similac Sensitive, so we stuck by it and would do so with the next baby should the need arise. **********UPDATE********** We just had our second child and immediately skipped all other formulas and went straight to Similac Sensitive. This has saved so much trouble from the first time around! Baby #2 is doing great on this formula, however, he has been diagnosed with Acid Reflux. This means feedings are very difficult and painful. The only alternative to try from this formula is Nutramigen, but its too expensive. We are giving baby #2 Zantac prescribed from his pediatrictian and it seems to be helping. It wasn't mentioned before, but if your baby is taking Similac Sensitive, but still having a lot of spit up or acts differently on the powder vs RTF. This is probably because the RTF is much thicker and babies are able to handle it better. The RTF is also much easier to digest than the powdered version because the nutrients have been fully dissolved 100% into liquid. However, with the powder, baby's belly may have to work a little harder to process the powder. Because our children have acid reflux, powder is not an option. The less spit up, the better because stomach acid is brought back up into the esophagus the more they spit up. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 This filter works PERFECT!,5,"Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the ""old fashion way"" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size. I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Superstore, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry. The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I.

" For more economical choice, check out Pill Pockets for CATS",5,"I have a 100lb dog, an Akita who HATES taking pills. She has NOT had Pill Pockets for Dogs, but she HAS had Pill Pockets for CATS. Now, before you click the ""No"" button after ""Was this review helpful to you?"", read further -- my comments will be of value to those with dogs that take SMALL pills! Andie has been taking pills for hypothyroidism for the past 9 years. Her pills are TINY. Wrapping them in meat or cheese never worked; she simply ate around the pill or spit it out. For years the only way I could get Andie to take pills was to, literally, shove them down her throat. (My hands are small enough and her mouth is big enough for me to do this. Thankfully she's a very trusting dog!) Then one day I was at the vet and noticed packages of something called ""Pill Pockets"". They had two kinds -- one for dogs and one for cats. Both came in flavors that Andie would like, but the dog Pill Pockets came in different sizes (small and large) while the cat Pill Pockets only came in one size (small). I looked at each package very carefully and noticed that the packages for cats had 45 Pill Pockets, while the packages for small dogs only had 35 Pill Pockets. And yet, the packages for small dogs cost MORE than the packages for cats -- huh? (On Superstore they are the same price, but the quantities are different.) So I looked at Andie's tiny thyroid pills, then looked at the Pill Pocket pictures on the packages and decided, ""I might as well save myself a buck and buy the kitty Pill Pockets. What the hey, Andie won't know she's eating something intended for cats!"" I've been happy with that decision ever since. I've bought both the salmon- and chicken-flavored Pill Pockets FOR CATS and Andie likes them both. The pockets are the perfect size, just big enough for her thyroid pills, and to date she has gulped down every one, then begged for another! And I like the fact that I get 10 more in each package than I would if I bought the Pill Pockets ""for dogs"". Pill Pockets are GREAT product, for cats OR dogs. I wish I had discovered them sooner! While I have never used the Pill Pockets for Dogs, I am 100% confident that they are excellent. That's why I'm giving this product 5 stars. If Andie's pills were bigger I would get the Pill Pockets for Dogs, and I know she would like them just as much. For the time being, though, I will stick with the smaller Pill Pockets for Cats, since they last a few days longer. So, this review is to pass along an idea that perhaps some dog owners had not considered: If your dog takes tiny pills like Andie does, go with the more economical choice and get Pill Pockets for Cats. Your dog will never know the difference! …",116 out of 117 users found this review helpful

I also agree that the assortment should have come with more information about the cheeses themselves along the lines of: You have selected this assortment, cheese names, background, taste descriptions, and serving suggestions (food and wine pairings both).

 Excellent,5,"I've come to trust the Stash brand, among only a few others due to its consistently excellent product line and variety. I was initially a fan of English Breakfast tea, but was introduced to Irish Breakfast tea some time back. A slightly thicker liquor produced than does English Breakfast, it mixes well with a variety of items (sugar and milk are recommended, but certain alcoholic bases or mixers sit quite nicely if you want to switch up the classic Hot Toddy concept or use Kahlua instead of sugar), and has an even stronger aroma and flavor than your regular black tea. If you're a fan of weaker brews where one or two dunks is good enough, this is not for you. I tend to steep this for a long while (tea experts would call me nuts for doing this as it could scald and alter the flavor of the leaves), but I love the strength of the brew afterwards.

 Another great dark K-cup coffee,4,"I love the rich, full-bodied flavor of a dark-roast coffee. When I bought my first Keurig machine I wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast K-cups that I could find. I initially settled on Newman's Own Dark Roast as my ""go-to"" coffee, but I didn't stop there. I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new. I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away. It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it. Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try. Here is my impression of it: After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story. It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away.

 Weird texture so I make smoothies with it,4,"I purchased this from a whole foods store, it was on sale. I thought I would give it a try. It needed to be stirred because the manna and oil separates (thats because it was warm) I hated the texture. It was so weird. SO I drink a chocolate protein smoothie every morning I make myself. I add a big tablespoon of this. It's wonderful. I have noticed a huge difference in my skin and my tongue. I know that sounds weird, my tongue. But its doing good things for my liver. I ran out of it and went a week without it, and the spots on my tongue came back, been on the coconut manna for 5 days now and they are gone again.

 Best spicy noodle on the market,5,"Although this noodle is the ""default"" according to my Korean friend, I believe it is the best spicy noodle on the market. It is VERY spicy for those that are not accustomed to spicy food. If you have not tried this noodle before, I'd recommend using only half the chili powder packet. Then adjust as necessary for later meals. I've been eating this noodle for years and years. The recipe that I normally use is: 1 egg Chinese green onions (chopped) lemon juice sesame oil Bring water to a boil with the noodle in a pot. Then pour out the water and run cold water over the noodle. This cleans the noodles of the materials left over from the manufacturing process. Set noodle aside. Then bring filtered water to a boil with both ingredient packets. It takes several minutes for the dried vegetables to hydrate. Put noodles back in. Add 3-4 drops of lemon juice and 1-2 drops of sesame oil. Add the green onions. Stir. Break the egg over the top of the noodles. Make sure your hands are dry to avoid steam burns! Wait until the egg white turns from translucent to white. Serve over large bowl. Break the egg and allow the yolk to run over the noodles. YUM! …",41 out of 48 users found this review helpful

" ""Tres intense"" K-cup blend stronger than the usual fare",4,"Dark Magic is for coffee drinkers searching for something bolder than the breakfast blends and flavored coffees ubiquitous on supermarket shelves. Whether it will satisfy depends on what you normally buy at coffee shops. My wife favors a latte or mocha, so she found Dark Magic too strong. I prefer an Americano, so I liked this roast. I tested the Dark Magic blend on Keurig's small cup (5.25 oz) setting to capture the strongest flavor. It was a nice improvement from Green Mountain's Trade Gingerbread I drank earlier in the week. Dark Magic is bolder than Coffee Kona Blend or Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend but no more bitter. If you need more caffeine, I recommend you add a Caffeinated Black Coffee Shot . In summary, I like ""tres intense"" roasts and Mountain Coffee Dark Magic is the darkest I have found in the Keurig lineup. I will post an update should I try a stronger blend than Dark Magic. Rating: Four stars.

 Contains Carrageenan,3,"I ordered ""Super Antioxidant"" Naked treats last week. Both my dogs love them. It's the only treat I've found so far that our dog with part of his lower jaw removed, due to oral melanoma, can and will chew. The problem is that I now see that the treats contain ""carrageenan"". Now, I will have to find another dog (or trash can) to give the treats to. I just ordered two more bags today. Although common in many foods, carrageenan is supposedly a carcinogen, per healthyeatingadvisor . I've read from other sources that carrageenan can cause stomach problems. If my dog had not already suffered from oral melanoma cancer, I might not be concerned. But, I figure why take any chances. Per notmilk , it's not the seaweed that's the problem, it's the processing to turn it into carrageenan. Just like with things like Nutrasweet, etc. Maybe this company uses a safe process.

 Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor,4,"To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes. NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words ""Medium Extra Bold"" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Superstore should correct that description and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other. …",454 out of 462 users found this review helpful

 Close but No Cigar,3,"We all know that sardines are almost a perfect food, though they clearly are an acquired taste. I happen to love brisling sardines and eat them regularly with European style whole grain bread for lunch with iced tea. I'm 100% Norwegian, so perhaps I have fish oil in my blood. When I came upon this product I was very excited. My local specialty grocer, Trader Joe's, recently discontinued offering King Oscar Cross Pack Extra Small Norwegian Brisling Sardines in olive oil and I was bereft, at least until I found these sardines from Crown Prince. I immediately ordered two cases from Superstore. These are acceptable sardines but I have to say they are decidedly second class when compared with those offered by King Oscar. Perhaps it is the fact Crown Prince sardines are ""wood smoked"" that dries them out, but that is my primary objection. King Oscar sardines are bathed in olive oil, moist and succulent. Yes, the Crown Prince product has olive oil in the bottom of the can but the sardines themselves remain dry. I've even taken to storing the boxes upside down in the hope the olive oil will permeate the sardines. Thus far, my efforts have failed. Perhaps the problem is the sardines themselves are a bit bigger than those ""extra small"" sardines from King Oscar. Sadly, despite my communication with the producer and distributor, I've been unable to locate a vendor either locally or online who carry my preferred sardines in the distinctive black box. I will eat the Crown Prince sardines, reminding myself of their excellent health benefits. I may even buy more of them if I'm unable to discover someone selling King Oscar but I will sorely miss the joy of eating sardines! …",44 out of 45 users found this review helpful
 A major improvement in menopausal symptoms,5,"I tried this product after researching menopausal heart palpitations and internal tremors on www.power-surge . The relief was immediate! What surprised me was the improvement in many other aspects of my health. No more headaches that feel like a tight cap binding my scalp. Reduction of my migraines. No more nightmares (brought on by hormone fluctuations). No more ""internal earthquakes"" or buggy-crawling sensations on my skin. Less anxiety (formerly triggered by hormonal changes). No more weak nails. Monthly acid reflux greatly reduced, sometimes none at all. Greatly reduced frequency of colds, flus and sinusitus. I chose the Calm with Calcium since I am dairy allergic. My body assimilates it well, much better than calcium & magnesium pills, which had little to no effect on the above-mentioned problems (in ANY ratio). Overall, I feel much calmer & more energetic.

" Could be stronger, but price is right",4,"Fusion Black Truffle Sea Salt has a definite black truffle flavor, that unlike truffle oils, actually comes from real black truffles. Almost all truffle oils are made with a synthetic chemical that closely resembles the taste of truffles. For those who want the real thing, this truffle salt is the cheapest way to get your truffle fix. The 5.5 ounce jar will last you a long time, even if you are a heavy seasoner. I would have preferred a stronger concentration of truffle flavor in exchange for a smaller quantity of salt. I spent twice as much for 1.5 oz of white truffle salt at a spice market, which i would purchase again over this. With the fusion black truffle salt, I end up oversalting my food to get the amount of black truffle flavor I desire. The packaging is excellent, allowing for easy dispensing and storage. Although i prefer white truffles, the taste from the black truffles is excellent. I actually prefer it to some slices of black truffle I've had from michelin starred restaurants. You may also want to check out truffle butters, which aren't as economical, but are a little better in practice. …",23 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Fine -- But Not Clementine,3,"I was pretty psyched to be able to try a case of this ""sparkling juice"" out, since during the summer I drink a fair amount of juice mixed with soda water. Also, I grew up in North Africa, where the clementine grows in abundance, and I was looking forward to revisiting a taste of childhood. On the pro side, the packaging is attractive, the 8.4oz can is a really handy size, and there's no added high fructose corn syrup. On the con side, the much-touted ""fortified"" aspect consists of 10% of your daily Vitamin C, B6, and Niacin, so great big deal there. Also, the carbonation isn't as strong as I prefer, although I will grant that this is a very subjective personal thing. Straight out of the can, it feels a touch flat to me. Finally, the biggest con of all -- there's no clementine juice in it! When I cracked the first can open and tried it over ice, at the end of the glass I thought, ""Hmm, kind of like clementine, but not quite."" Then I looked at the label and saw that 's a blend of white grape, apple, lemon, and orange juice concentrates! Well, nice try Izze...but no cigar. Ultimately, it's something I'll keep around to use as a mixer with vodka, but not that tasty to me on its own. And frankly, I find the labeling of it as ""clementine"" totally shameless and off-putting. …",14 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Orijen and small dogs,1,As I write this my 17 lbs Bischon Poodle is in the vet hospital after liver shut down yesterday. Looking for the best food on the market for my dog I researched and read the rave reviews for Orijen all natural food. I decided to place my dog on it. She has been on it for a little over 3 months. She refused to eat the past couple of days. I took her to the vet. The high protein level in Orijen food had put my dog into liver shutdown. I fed her according to recommendations. Protein needed for a small dog is 10-13 % Orijen 39%. No where does Orijen put a warning on their food stating that it could be detrimental to small dogs. I would never recommend this product for a small dog. I would never use it for any dog of mine. The normal level of liver enzymes should have been 70-100. My dogs after being on Orijen for 3 months 750. The risks are too high think carefully and make sure you consult your vet.

" Our favorite extra-bold K-cup--dark, rich, full-bodied",5,"Jet Fuel is our favorite of the Coffee People ""extra-bold trilogy""--Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, and Black Tiger. It's dark, sweet, and rich, with a fuller body than Wake Up Call or Black Tiger. It has a clean finish and notes of chocolate and honey. We also love the new packaging. Since K-cups are nitrogen-packed, the coffee doesn't go stale, so the last cup is as good as the first. If there are a couple of dark-roast lovers in your family, a box of 50 will be slurped down in no time. And I have to say that, even though we store them in the back of a dark cabinet, the box graphics are a nice touch. It probably cost them a fraction of a fraction of a cent to make it a little more attractive, and I appreciate that! When you first got your Keurig brewer, you drank through the sampler coffees... and if you asked yourself, ""Is that as dark as it gets??"" then I think you'll go for Jet Fuel or one of the other Coffee People EBs.

 Delicious gluten-free bread,5,"I think this bread is wonderful. I make it by hand (not in a bread machine), and I don't even have a mixer.

When I proof the yeast, I have found that it works better if I add a pinch of sugar to the water, and I also give the yeast 10 minutes to foam; 5 minutes didn't seem to be enough. Because of this bread and the whole grain mix, I see the GF diet as much more feasible. It's great bread even compared to gluten breads. And I find the bread sweet enough just as it is.

" Expiration dates - Seriously, ignore them.",5,"A lot of people have been posting about the near-expired dates on the coffee. First, I'd like to mention that this product is intentionally labeled to have a really short shelf-life, and not to ensure freshness. The funny thing about expiration dates is that for something like this, it honestly doesn't matter. I've gotten batches that are expired (for cheaper) and the taste is the same great amazing taste as it was when it was well within the ""Best Until"" range. Yes, I have taken two packs, one expired and one not expired, and they both are the same delicious taste. The reality is that expiration dates are a wonderful tool that make people throw perfectly fine food and go out and buy more. Especially with dairy products: If it's a few days over, most people will toss out cartons of perfectly good milk or eggs that could keep for another five weeks, which keeps people buying it more frequently. The fact is, if you would drink it without knowing the expiration date is past (it doesn't smell or look bad) then it's not only safe to eat, but a waste to toss. This isn't true for drugs, however. If your medicine says it's expired, it's expired. Also, condoms. Those do lose integrity over time. So, this is a product that intentionally has a very short shelf-life because it makes ridiculous people go, ""Oh, no, instead of getting it cheaper online and in bulk, I'll just buy a lot of more expensive smaller packs for more money."" Starbucks enjoys charging their consumers for their instant coffee like it's magical pixie dust, and the only way they can stop people from buying it from other cheaper sources is to give it a tiny shelf-life.

 Fantastic Basic Sugar Cookie!,5,"I bake dozens and dozens of cookies throughout the year, with a huge chunk of that happening at Christmastime.

I compared the ease of adding just a couple of ingredients the package mix, to all that I would have to do, to make up a batch of basic sugar cookies, and realized that I was working just too hard! From there, I made two different recipes from this wonderful mix. First, for Orange Cookies, I added a heaping tablespoon of orange zest, 1 1/2 tsp. of orange extract, and 1 cup of Rice Crispies.

 A fine new option for a low calorie sweetner,4,"PROS: Very nearly like sugar Works great in cold beverages Okay for hot beverages (see cons below) No 'cooling effect' Worked reasonably in a baking application No synthesized, chemical ingredients CONS: Contains trace amounts of sugar and molasses ""Natural"" but not necessarily non-GMO Not exactly zero calories (greater than two servings likely greater than 5 calories) Very slightly bitter aftertaste in hot beverages Slight honey-like overtones added to the sweetness The 'natural' moniker is relative: it contains some refined sugar and is not necessarily from non-GMO sources NOTE: Please realize that when reviewing any food item, including sweeteners, I can only give my opinion. Everyone's taste buds are different and everyone's perception of what tastes good in a sweetener is different. I have done my best to describe this product, but in the end you will have to taste it yourself and see what you think. FULL REVIEW: Nectresse is the latest no calorie sweetener from McNeil Nutritionals. It is an admixture of Erythritol, sucrose, monk fruit (luo han guo) extract, and molasses. The combination adds another low calorie sweetener to the mix and generally successful, depending on the application. WHAT'S IN THE PACKAGE: Nectresse is supplied in small nearly 1/2 teaspoon, 2.4 g packets (for comparison there are 4.2 g of sugar per teaspoon). That said, 1/2 teaspoon of Nectress supplies the same sweetness as two teaspoons of sugar. The packets are thicker foil packets, not the paper packets such as sugar an other sweetners are often packaged in. This is likely due to the need to protect the Nectress from moisture in the environment, as it is likely more hygroscopic (moisture absorbing) than other sweeteners. The Nectress itself is slightly yellow in color but it has the same texture as sucrose, mimicking a very light, blonde sugar. It mixes easily in hot or cold beverages and handles very similarly to sugar for these kinds of applications. RAW TASTE: When tasted directly out of the packet, the Nectresse is almost as cleanly sweet as table sugar, but it has some slightly honey overtones. Overall, this is a very pleasant sweetness. There is no bitter after taste when tasted cold: if you try the directly out of the package taste test with most Stevia brands, the result is a shocking bitter after taste. Plain erythritol has a cleaner, sucrose sweetness but is plagued with a very pronounced and to some disturbing cool after sensation (kind of like you get with mint or menthol, without the mint or menthol taste). On the upside, the sweetness factor is really quite good, depending on the application the taste is nearly as good as sugar. When sweetening cold beverages (ice tea, lemonade) the Nectresse really shined. The sweetness level was robust and it was hard to distinguish from sugar. The honey-like overtones may not jibe with every application, but these were at least pleasant overtones as compared to other non-sugar sweeteners. Sadly, when used in hot beverages, such as coffee, there is a slightly perceptible, bitter aftertaste. This is similar to the aftertaste you might get from Stevia, but not nearly as pronounced. Unlike Stevia, the taste is simply bitter--there are no licorice after tones. The more sweetener used, the more the bitterness. If you like your coffee lightly sweet, you may not notice it. If you like your coffee on the more intensely sweeter side, it is noticeable. That said, the bitter taste is less pronounced in hot tea, possibly secondary to the acidity. Please note, that the bulk of the sweetness here is likely from the monk fruit extract. Monk fruit is about 150 times as sweet as sugar, so you would only need very tiny amounts of monk fruit extract for sweetness. The erythritol, sugar, and molasses are added to add bulk, texture, and consistency to the product, so that it more closely resembles and behaves like table sugar. They may also compliment or balance the taste of the product, but can't account for the level of sweetness. (There is only 1/2 teaspoon of product per package: erythritol is only 70% as sweet as sugar--it would take more than 2 1/2 teaspoons of erythritol to equal the sweetness of 2 teaspoons of sugar. And quite obviously, even 1/2 teaspoon of sucrose couldn't get you the equivalent of 2 teaspoons of itself. Molasses is not as sweet as sugar and has a distinctive taste, so there's not enough molasses in the mix to account for the sweetness. ) BAKING: On the FAQ section on Nectresse's website, it was mentioned that you could bake with Nectresse. Ever interested in experimentation, I decided to give it a try. I used a simple sugar cookie recipe and baked three kinds of cookies sweetened with: 1) sugar; 2) Nectresse; and 3) pure erythritol. I commandeered my 9 and 12 year-old kids for the bake off. Please note: I do realize that different sweeteners have different properties. To keep things easy, however, I simply replaced the sugar in the recipe with either Nectresse or erythritol. I do realize that the different products have different sweetness levels and different chemical properties and are not so easily interchangeable, so you should take the results of the little experiment with a grain of salt (real salt). Even so the results were enlightening. After a family taste test, the results were as follows (drum roll please): Sugar came in first, followed by Nectresse, followed by erythritol. 1) Sugar had the best consistency and the best sugar cookie taste. Cosmetically, the sugar cookies also spread more evenly and looked better than the other cookies. 2) Nectresse had excellent sweetness in this application. You might have expected cookies that were far too sweet, given that volume for volume Nectresse should be about 4 times as sweet as sugar. Even so, the sweetness after baking was comparable and quite good. In the cookie, at least, there was no evidence of the bitter after taste and in spite of the Nectresse containing some erythritol filler, there was no 'cooling effect' on the tongue. The cookies failed on the level of texture. The weren't as crisp as the real sugar cookies. Still, you could imagine if the company can mix the Nectresse with the right kind of fillers for baking, it might be able to perform really well. 3) Erythritol cookies were more like the pure sugar cookies in texture, but, on a taste, they failed on a couple of levels. The sweetness was pristine, but due to the fact that erythritol is only about 70% as sweet as sugar, the erythritol cookies didn't quite reach the level of sweetness needed in a sugar cookie. I am still glad that I didn't weight out 1/3 more of the erythritol to get the comparable amount of sweetening, however, because the 'cooling effect' was out of control. (Erythritol has a peculiar cooling effect on the mouth--kind of like the cooling effect you get by eating mint or menthol, but without the mint or menthol flavor.) Even at the lower level of sweetness, the cookies had an unacceptable level of cooling that was a bit of a turn off for the family. (Had they been mint flavored sugar cookies this might have been okay, but with the plain flavor, the kids and I felt the cooling effect was overwhelming.) WHAT IS IN NECTRESSE: The most touted ingredient of the combination is monk fruit. Monk fruit is really not new to the sweetener scene. In the past, the sweetener was mostly marketed as luo han guo and has been used in the far east, mostly to sweeten cold beverages and often in combination with other sweeteners (natural and artificial). The raw fruit extract is usually refined, allowing the removal of interfering flavors. It has been marketed in the past as a sugar substitute, the most well known brand of which is Lakanto ( All Natural Sweetener, 800 grams ). I have always been interested in tasting Lakanto, but the price tag is prohibitive. Although monk fruit is the main ingredient, Nectresse also has other ingredients. Erythritol, sugar (sucrose), and molasses are added to balance out the flavor, texture, and consistency. IS IT NATURAL? McNeil is marketing Nectresse as a natural sweetener, in contrast to Splenda (sucralose), McNeil's flagship artificial sweetener. Nectresse may be natural, but there may be a few caveats here. The fact that McNeil Nutritionals is a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, a big pharma company not known for a 'crunchy granola' outlook might give one some pause. On the downside, there is no indication that the sweetener is derived from non-GMO sources. The major ingredient, Erythritol, is often refined from corn. Sugar and molasses are well known, but are also the products that this sweetener was designed to replace (and that most users want to avoid). In all fairness, the fact that Nectresse has nearly 0 calories per serving tells you that sugar and molasses content is very low and that they were probably added to subtly balance the taste and/or add consistency to the product. This is not all that different from adding dextrose (glucose) and maltodextran to Splenda brand products. There is less than a gram of these products in Splenda. These products are added to Splenda as a filler for the sucralose and to balance taste and consistency. That said, Nectresse is not exactly a 'zero' calorie option, but a very minimal calorie option. The FDA allows for products to advertise as 'zero' calories if they have less than 5 calories per serving. My guess is that after you get beyond two packets, you exceed the 5 calories per serving. Still not too bad, as the sweetness of two packets of Nectresse is the equivalent of 4 teaspoons of sugar. Although Nectresse may be derived from natural sources, all the natural source may be refined to a point that is not acceptable to all customers. COMPARED TO OTHER LOW CALORIE SWEETENERS: I think that Nectresse compares fairly with other low calorie sweeteners. Obviously, the choice of sweeteners that you use is mostly dependent on your personal taste. I can only speak for my own taste buds, but Nectresse scores very high for me. It is very nearly up there with xylitol and erythritol, in terms of a pure sucrose taste. When it comes to tasting like sucrose, I'd have to give xylitol a bit of an edge here, but xylitol fails at higher amounts of intake due to GI side effects (e.g. diarrhea). Erythritol is also more purely sweet than Nectresse and generally does not come with GI side effects, but is dogged by that overwhelming cooling effect that can occur at sweetening concentrations. Still, I'd rather use xylitol or erythritol in my hot coffee than Nectresse, as Nectresse has that bitter taste with hot coffee. In cold beverages, however, Nectresse wins hands down. There are a lot of stevia fans out there and I wish them well, but even brands with lesser bitter aftertastes still have a bitter edge that kills it for me and the sweetness of stevia seems to range from a cotton candy like taste to licorice overtones; sweet but not sugar-like. Sadly, stevia just doesn't do it for me. Compared to the artificial sweeteners, the best of the crowd for sweetening my morning coffee would be Equal. I think that Nectresse compares favorably to this and I would use Nectresse rather than Equal if I had the choice. (Equal, for me, has a fairly good sweetness, but it is not quite comparable to sugar.) Nectresse beats Splenda (sucralose) hands down, for me, as I prefer the very slight bitterness to that wacky, artificial aftertaste that I get with Splenda. Ditto for saccharine, which just doesn't do it for me. Saccharine never tasted quite like sugar to me and has a bitter aftertaste that overwhelms. CONCLUSION: All in all, Nectresse is a more than respectable alternative, low calorie sweetener. For my palate, it is comparable to most other natural sugar substitutes for taste and beats the artificial sweeteners hands down. Sadly, though,none of the alternatives tastes or handles perfectly like table sugar. But after trying Nectresse out, it is definitely something that I will use in the future. …",53 out of 54 users found this review helpful
 Refuting the 2-Star Review.,5,"Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation. So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked ""natural""), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those. Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating.

 Many uses for this healthy body tonic,5,"A good friend sent me an email a year ago regarding the health benefits of Green Giant Asparagus Spears (health-full all by itself, and contains no pesticides or preservatives). Having a number of health challenges, including fibromyalgia, I decided to give the asparagus regimen a try -- and am I ever glad I did! It has helped in so many ways, and if I happen to forget and miss a day, I can tell right away the next day in the amount and location of increased pain. I put the whole can in a blender, plus a tablespoon of minced garlic for added flavor, and puree. With four tablespoons taken twice daily, the benefits are noticeable within a few days. When you sign up for the subscription service with Superstore, this product is delivered to your door for free, and at the best price I've been able to find anywhere. I highly recommend this regimen as a dietary supplement. As I am not a doctor, I have included an excerpt from someone who is: As a biochemist, I have made an extensive study of all aspects of cancer, and all of the proposed cures. As a result, I am convinced that asparagus fits in better with the latest theories about cancer. Asparagus contains a good supply of protein called histones, which are believed to be active in controlling cell growth. For that reason, I believe asparagus can be said to contain a substance that I call cell growth normalizer. That accounts for its action on cancer and in acting as a general body tonic. In any event, regardless of theory, asparagus used as we suggest, is a harmless substance. The FDA cannot prevent you from using it and it may do you much good... It has been reported by the US National Cancer Institute, that asparagus is the highest tested food containing glutathione, which is considered one of the body's most potent anticarcinogens and antioxidants. …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 New formula,1,"My dogs have been on Canidae for the past several years and even the picky dog who has lost over half her teeth loved it. However, I recently bought a new bag of Canidae. The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula. I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it. The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything. I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat. NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags. Their response: ********* Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas. ********* I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it.

 It does make an AMAZING bread !!!,5,"This past December my 7-year old son was diagnosed with allergic to wheat. This is a little guy that LOVES bread !!! He is also allergic to dairy.

 These noodles are incredible!,5,"I found a link to the tofu shirataki in an article on MSN talking about foods to stay away from.

Being Italian and an avid pasta fan, I quickly ""googled"" and found a link to Superstore on www.house-foods . I ordered 5 packages of the noodles, because I have been eating health food for awhile and despite the poor reviews, I was ready to give these a shot. I am so glad that I did. They are like tough spaghetti. By tough I do not mean, tire rubber, but more like over cooked. That doesn't bother me at all. I cooked them in marinara sauce, put them in broth and made an Asian style soup and served them with teriyaki chicken. These things are so versatile and fabulous. I am on weight watchers and an entire bag of these noodles has 0 points and only 40 calories with 4 grams of fiber. You can't ask for a better alternative to pasta. The expiration date is about 4 months from when you order, so you don't have to gobble them up immediately. It also makes stocking up more convenient. I will be stocking up on these indefinitely!

" Good, economy-sized wakame package",5,"As you may have read, seaweed is a good source of nutrients, and has benefits for your skin and hair. Wakame is a kind of kelp (Undaria pinnatifida) and is most commonly found in miso soup and Japanese salads. If you use wakame a lot, this bag will fit your bill. I've been using this brand for years because it's big and one bag usually lasts me a year or more. Text and texture is comparable to wakame brands I've had in Japan. There is more than enough dried seaweed here for 50+ bowls of miso soup. Just snip off a few bits of seaweed directly into the hot soup with a pair of scissors and let it rehydrate for a few minutes, then enjoy. Wakame is also good as a salad. Rehydrate in water for 4-5 minutes, then drain and cut into desired lengths. Add some julienned cucumber, daikon, carrots, and sesame seeds and you have a simple Japanese seaweed salad. Top with a Japanese-style dressing or any of salad dressing of your choice. You can also add some imitation crab leg pieces and mayo, or use the wakame as a bedding for other foods. Wakame should be eaten shortly after rehydrating, otherwise it'll lose its elastic texture and get soggy. Product of Korea. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 BEWARE These are 2nds!,2,The candy I ordered from Superstore was for distribution to the neighborhood children this past Halloween.

The more important concern became evident when it arrived. This candy is 2nd's from the manufacturing line. It is candy that was not wrapped properly. This varies from the wrapper not quite being sealed to only ½ a wrapper to begin with or completely out of the wrapper because at least one end was open. At least 25% of all the candy received was out of the wrappers. Another 50% was not sealed on at least one end. This would have made it inappropriate to distribute.

" A very nice, full flavored medium roast coffee",5,"I prefer deep, dark roasted coffees but many people don't. My mother used standard household blends such as Folger's for many years.

The acidity is medium-low so it won't have too much of a bite, especially of you use cream. The flavor is surprisingly complex with some spice (maybe cardamom or anise and a little pepper) as well as a rich coffee finish. This will not replace my favorite dark roasts but I will keep it on hand for those guests who find a ""Starbucks-type"" of coffee too strong or bitter.

 My son likes these,4,"This is what my wife wrote about these on her blog: Pros: Great as a first finger food, low choking risk, tastes good, not very messy, packaged conveniently for on-the-go snack, does not contain wheat. Cons: Not sold in most supermarkets (have only found them at Walmart and Sam's Club and on Superstore ), caused me temporary panic b/c they are made in China and contain skim milk powder BUT there seems to be no cause for concern. I've been giving Baby Mum-Mum rice crackers to SB as a snack since he was about 7 months old, and it was love at first bite. I taste all the stuff I give to SB to see how edible they are, and I have to say that they are pretty darn tasty. The crackers are very light and airy and sort of melt in your mouth as you chew (or mash in SB's case). They have a lightly sweet taste that makes them easy to eat. The box contains 12 conveniently wrapped packages of 2 crackers each - perfect for sticking in your diaper bag for snack time on the go. After SB's bottom front teeth came in at about 6.5 months, I started looking for a teething cracker or biscuit that doesn't have wheat in it (I read that it's better to wait until baby is 9-12 months old before introducing wheat due to the allergy risk) and couldn't find anything in the grocery aisles, surprisingly. Then I came across Baby Mum-Mums at my local Walmart, which are made of rice, not wheat. Although Baby Mum-Mums aren't exactly a teething cracker, they were close enough for me. I mainly wanted something that SB could practice biting and chewing on. They've turned out to be the perfect starter finger food. Initially, I would hold the cracker for SB as he chomped on it, but after a little encouragement, he started taking the cracker in his own hand and feeding himself. Yay, his first successful attempt at finger food self-feeding! The crackers were great for giving him finger food practice, since they are easy for his little hands to clasp and big enough for him to find his mouth with it. As you can see from the picture, they have a long oval shape and are pretty thin, so it's easy to bite off pieces. And they don't create much mess at all - a few crumbs here and there. I've found them to be a great distraction for SB when he gets fussy on car rides or in his stroller. There are a lot of things to like about Baby Mum-Mums. The box highlights the following: -No Artificial Colors or Flavors -No Preservatives -Gluten, Egg & Peanut Free -Baked, Low in Fat & No Trans Fat -No Added Fats or Oils But there is another important thing to note about these crackers. They are made in China AND contain milk powder. About a week after the melamine-tainted milk scandal came to light in China, it suddenly hit me that my SB's beloved Baby Mum-Mums might be one of the foods affected by the tainted milk. I went straight to the web to see what information I could dig up on Mum-Mums and the melamine issue, and...it seems that they are safe. A big sigh of relief. This is what I found: Statement from National Importers (importer/distributor of the product): This basically states that Mum-Mums contain milk powder imported from New Zealand and that food authorities in China, Australia, Canada, and the US have tested batches of Mum-Mums with results all coming back negative for melamine contamination.

" 14 days so far, after a lot of researching online...",5,"I am 34 year-old male who had terrible side effects (severe constipation) from statins while trying to reduce my cholesterol of 234. I had to quit taking them. A friend at work recommended 2 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar with some juice every day. She said her results shocked her doctor after 2 months. She also said it worked for her sister. So, I tried it that night, and also wanted to check it out online, because I'm always a skeptic. What I found was that a LOT of people recommend ACV for a whole range of things that interest me. After reading all I've read, and from my personal experience so far, I'm really diggin it. The only side effects I've seen is the taste, and because it is very acidic, people say you should keep it off your teeth as much as possible. Here's a list of some of the things I've read that it helps dramatically with: Cholesterol, blood pressure, immune system, detoxification, eczema, migraines, headaches & sinus headaches, hair thinning & hair loss, warts, slow steady weight loss, diabetes, depression, insomnia, increased energy & alertness, infections & cancers, the flu, sinus infections & post nasal drips, allergies & asthma, chronic fatigue, sore throats, arthritis, ulcers, bowel problems & IBS, nail fungus, acne, skin problems & complexion. The list goes on and on, to the point where it sounds WAY too good to be true. I read several testimonials from teachers and nurses that used to get sick repeatedly, to the point where they thought they'd have to quit their jobs, until they started taking ACV. They claim they don't get sick anymore at all. Since there really doesn't seem to be any side effects from ACV, I can't think of any reason NOT to try Apple Cider Vinegar. I am curious/anxious to see if it helps with some of my stuff. In particular, I get sick. A LOT. I work in retail and I usually need antibiotics at least 4 times each winter for sinus infections, sore throats and post nasal drips, going back to when I was a kid. Allergies. Cholesterol. More energy and some weight-loss sounds good too! Basically, it seems to clean out your blood and detoxify your body really well, which helps to get the whole machine running like it should. I've only been on it for 14 days as of this writing, and what I can testify about so far is: 1. Energy/Alertness. I feel really good so far. Many users claim they feel a very persistent boost of energy within a day, and I certainly felt it too, and it hasn't stopped. I've also been sleeping very well. For at least 10 years, (since about when I had mono) I have always felt like I was in a bit of a brain fog. (No jokes please!) Since taking it these past two weeks, I feel very alert with increased energy. It just FEELS like my body and brain are simply ""on their game"", so to speak. 2. Allergies. When I started taking the ACV, my allergies were already bothering me for a bit, and I've been clear as a bell since the first day. Also, every time I go to my in-laws, my allergies go nuts from their dog. I usually have to start popping Benadryl within a half an hour. This past week, I was there for 2 nights and 3 days and didn't even need 1 pill. My sinuses were totally clear! Was it the ACV? Other people said they had similar quick findings, but I don't want to say for sure. Ragweed season is right around the corner, so we'll see how it handles that. 3. Complexion. ACV supposedly helps clear it up in a slow but steady fashion. My face was breaking out really bad for the past month when my cholesterol pills screwed up my whole system. In addition, I have always had many blackheads on my nose area, no matter what I washed it with. I poured a little bit of ACV on some paper towel and rubbed the area with it like a Stridex Pad, and within 2 days my facial complexion looks better than it has in years. I've never gotten results like this! Again, is it the ACV? I can't say for sure. It could just be that my body is happy I've stopped doing what I HAD been doing. Watch... I'll probably wake up with a big 'ol zit tomorrow morning! In general, it just feels like I am being detoxed, and natural remedies like this are up my alley. If it helps with just 1 or 2 of these things, with no side effects like my pills gave me- I'll keep at it for a while. I don't want to go around running my mouth until I am positive it is seriously working, but I wouldn't mind hearing if it is working for other people too. So let me know if you try it and what you find, and I'll continue to do the same... I'm a bit of a closet scientist who loves to discuss his data! The only other things I take daily are a Men's One-a-Day vitamin, Activia (yogurt), Claritin (allergy pill), and a fish oil pill (also good for cholesterol & heart health). I've been taking 2 tablespoons of the ACV mixed with very little water, like a shot, and then I chase it with more water. The bad taste is over in less than 5 seconds- No sweat! One thing I've read over and over again, is to NOT buy the regular ACV you find in the store. People say that it has been distilled and filtered to make it look more clear- but that just takes out all the nutrients and potency. They say to look for ""organic"" or ""raw"" from a health store or farm stand, and it is just as cheap. They say that the cloudier it looks, the better. Just Google ""apple cider vinegar"" and you'll quickly find hundreds of user testimonials and advice from around the world, from all types of people. I was skeptical at first, but you have to ask yourself... ""Could ALL these people be morons?"" Or, ""Why would they all lie about a 3 dollar bottle that they aren't making any money from?"" There doesn't seem to be much to lose. If it stops working, I'll stop drinking! I'll write another review after my cholesterol check-up within 2 months, and probably another after I see how it does with colds this winter! Good health!! …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 WORMS IN GREENIES?????,1,This is my second box of greenies that I have been quite pleased up until today. I pull out on greenie and found a WORM along with larvae!! This is horrible. I had this box for 3 months. I emptied the box and found about a dozen more worms and was disgusted. I couldn't believe greenies product was contaminating my dogs. The expiration date is dated 2013 so this clearly shows that there is something wrong with this product. I hope someone from the greenies department will give contact me to fix this. I will be posting these comments on every doggy treat review forum/website until I hear from someone so I know that they are trying to fix it and shows how much they value their customers and product. I don't know how long I have been feeding greenies with worms in them so my two pups will now have to go to the vet. …,12 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Be careful of ingredients,2,"Carrageenan is an additive used to thicken foods. In Feb. 2000 issue of Cancer Letters, a cancer research journal; Carrageenan was injected into the vicinity of a growing tumor. The carrageenan caused the tumor to grow faster. I do not want to give my dog a cancer accelerator. I also check food labels as well. Some of the other flavors do not have carrageenan listed in the ingredients. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful
" Delicious, medicinal honey",5,"Granted, this honey is on the pricey side, but I have to say it's more than worth it. My husband had been trying all kinds of ways to tame his ulcerative colitis for months, but the only thing that worked was this raw organic manuka honey. The only other things he used with it were a product call Sera Vera and some probiotics. He still needs to watch his diet somewhat, but he has not had loose stools or blood in his stools since he went on this raw organic Manuka honey and Sera Vera routine. Now, if he eats something that does not agree with him completely, he will get gas but no blood or diarrhea. This is a very big relief for both of us. We really wanted to avoid having him go on meds. That is just a vicious circle and we were aiming at curing rather than just controlling symptoms. We seem to be headed in the right direction as we are adding more and more foods back into his diet slowly and he is starting to gain his weight back. He loves the taste of the honey and not only eats it on its own, but also on toast several times a day. It has helped heal his gut, it stimulates his appetite, and it satisfies his cravings for sweets, which is great, because he is not eating any sugar at all right now, because sugar depresses the immune system. I have tasted the honey too and I love the taste. I am so glad we found this wonderful resource. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Not good,1,"I ordered the 10 oz crab cakes. Usually you expect a shell or so, but not in EVERY bite. The 'lump' was not all lump meat either. These were a great disappointment. The flavor is fine, but I would never order these again. I have found G&M crab cakes to be true lump and much better than these. …",17 out of 18 users found this review helpful
 NO waste at all ----  great for training  ----  all dogs love liver treats,5,"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.) Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels). Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs. The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product. There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Here's the nutritional analysis: -100% freeze dried liver -NO additives or preservatives. -Crude protein..... not less than 50% -Crude fat..... not less than 5% -Crude fiber..... not more than 3% -Moisture..... not more than 6% …",39 out of 51 users found this review helpful
 1 out of 2 dogs liked it!,4,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:42 Mins </span>Since neither of my 2 dogs can write about this new Lickety Stik, I will do my best. A new idea for treats is always welcomed. We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver. We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey. Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol). Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike. I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it. First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly. It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog. If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable. It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label. The video is one of our taste tests. Hope you enjoy it. …",19 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Buy it for the tea,5,"I saw this and thought it would be worth trying, primarily to have a nice box to keep tea in. The box is great, but I was astonished at how much I like the teas. Whatever their source for tea (100% Ceylon) has a very smooth and distinctive flavor. Their English Breakfast is easily the best black tea I've tried (and I love tea), at least when taken without milk. It's fine with milk, but isn't as good as some UK teas. The flavored teas are all very well balanced as well. I'd strongly recommend this (or a related smaller size) if you're looking for some very great tea as well as a good place to keep it. …",37 out of 37 users found this review helpful
