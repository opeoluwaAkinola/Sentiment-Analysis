 Converted me to tea over coffee - it's that good,5,"Before buying my Keurig brewer, I never really like black tea. I would drink herbal tea from tme to time but black tea always seemed too bitter. After trying Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast Tea, I was instantly converted. There is no bitter taste and it's so much less acidic than coffee and therefore much easier on my stomach. It has a mild, slightly fruity taste that is perfect with breakfast or really anytime of day. I've tried it plain and with a bit of milk and sugar as well. I honestly have become more of a tea drinker than coffee drinker since trying this delicious tea. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Great Plants,5,"I really like prayer plants and was interested in buying a red one. I decided to purchase these since I was having trouble finding one locally. They arrived quickly by priority mail. The 4 inch pots had tape around the top to keep the soil in place and the box they were in was full of packing peanuts. Be prepared to repot the plants within the week, 4 inch pots are a bit small. The green plant was much larger than the red one. The green one was also blooming (they arrived in September.) After repotting both plants they are both thriving and growing like weeds. They like light, but not direct sun. The green one folds its leaves more tightly than the red at night. The only thing that would have improved the purchase experience whould have been if Hirt's Gardens had included a care sheet for the plants. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

" Expiration dates - Seriously, ignore them.",5,"A lot of people have been posting about the near-expired dates on the coffee. First, I'd like to mention that this product is intentionally labeled to have a really short shelf-life, and not to ensure freshness. The funny thing about expiration dates is that for something like this, it honestly doesn't matter. I've gotten batches that are expired (for cheaper) and the taste is the same great amazing taste as it was when it was well within the ""Best Until"" range. Yes, I have taken two packs, one expired and one not expired, and they both are the same delicious taste. The reality is that expiration dates are a wonderful tool that make people throw perfectly fine food and go out and buy more. Especially with dairy products: If it's a few days over, most people will toss out cartons of perfectly good milk or eggs that could keep for another five weeks, which keeps people buying it more frequently. The fact is, if you would drink it without knowing the expiration date is past (it doesn't smell or look bad) then it's not only safe to eat, but a waste to toss. This isn't true for drugs, however. If your medicine says it's expired, it's expired. Also, condoms. Those do lose integrity over time. So, this is a product that intentionally has a very short shelf-life because it makes ridiculous people go, ""Oh, no, instead of getting it cheaper online and in bulk, I'll just buy a lot of more expensive smaller packs for more money."" Starbucks enjoys charging their consumers for their instant coffee like it's magical pixie dust, and the only way they can stop people from buying it from other cheaper sources is to give it a tiny shelf-life. Look at some of the other reviews, here. It's working! …",117 out of 144 users found this review helpful
 Good taste and chewiness,4,"I liked the taste and texture. However, one of my packages arrived with the vaccuum broken and the **** had turned to complete dust. I wrote to customer support, but have yet to hear from them. You have to boil the **** for 30 minutes, covered, let them sit for another 25 minutes, still covered, then rinse them in cold water. Then you coat them in sugar syrup, which you make by simmering equal parts of sugar and water. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful
" No meat by-products, good and safe, Turkey & Chicken Dog Food",5,"Everyone knows about tainted pet food from China. Newman's Own is a branding that I can trust, and this one is a real winner. Newman's is what I would make if I were making it for my own family, as in you can trust that it is great tasting, good for you and safe to eat. I'm very pleased that the Newman's line was extended from people food to pet food. When it comes to moist dog food every single choice on the market has meat by-products except Newman's Own. My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety. In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too. While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog. One other finding: When you open almost any moist dog food you smell ""dog food"". When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat. It actually smells good. Imagine that. …",29 out of 29 users found this review helpful
 OMG It WORKS!,5,"I have been using this product for almost a week now and my only complaint is that I didn't find pit about it sooner! First, a bit about myself. I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess! I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM. Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep! Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too. Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day! I feel so much lighter, my friends and family always said I was full of **** and I guess they were right! I guess after reading my review you are thinking either she is being paid for this or it really works, well it is definitely the latter! It is working for me and I believe it will work for you too, try it what have you got to lose besides a crappy mood, sleepless night, a lot of **** and cramps? Jeez, I think $23.00 is a pretty fair trade off don't you. One more thing the dosage that I am using is two teaspoons at night and one teaspoon in the morning, both with 3 teaspoons of benefiber mixed in girl still needs her fiber! and BTW it's a store brand). I hope this review helps and if you have any questions please contact me, I am real and this review is real! …",58 out of 69 users found this review helpful
 Whoa...,4,"I am too tired to do a video review. Maybe, I will do one later. This oil is a must have for ladies with natural hair. I am AAF with 3c/4b hair that has been thinning since the birth of my child. I have been natural for 4 years and mostly keep my hair in cornrows because of this dry, hot weather. I do ""baby"" my hair. Weekly conditioning, bi-weekly deep condition, satin scarves etc etc. I used this oil for my weekly conditioning. I put this on my dry hair, let it sit for a few hours (after dinner). I washed it out with apple cider vinegar and applied some shea butter and went to bed. When I wokeup I had a new head of curls!! Perfect little corkscrew curls and they were so moist. I have also been using it on my ends when I were my ponytails (between braiding). I have only been using this oil about two weeks but it really has made a difference in my curl definition and the moisture content of my hair. I highly recommend this proudcts to my natural girls!! It does have a smell to it but it disappears throughout the day. Be sure to rinse it out well. …",44 out of 47 users found this review helpful

" A spectacular alternative to other ""fruit"" snacks",5,"My family first became hooked on Annie's products when we tried the delicious mac and cheese. I've been on something of a crusade to eliminate high fructose corn syrup from our diets, as well as unsavory chemical preservatives. My five-year-old has always been a big fan of fruit snacks but I normally hate giving them to her as they are no healthier than candy. While I won't claim that these are 100% healthy, I can say that they are completely free of all the artificial and highly processed junk that goes into their cheaper counterparts. Yes, they are pricier than other ""fruit"" snacks on the market but the higher price tag on these comes along with higher quality. I'm more than willing to shell out the extra cash if it means that my daughter will be ingesting fewer chemicals and less corn syrup. What's more, my daughter not only loves the taste of these, I do as well. Other brands have a very artificial too-sweet flavor while these taste like real fruit juice. I was surprised at how good they are as I normally avoid fruit snacks because of the taste. I also like the texture of these. They are chewy but smoother and will dissolve in your mouth if you suck on them. They don't have that weird hardness or lumpy sort of quality that other fruit snacks do. …",41 out of 41 users found this review helpful

 major disappointment,2,"Looking at my 80's box, I am very disappointed with it. I cannot believe that there is a 1 liter bottle of soda in this small box, it takes up a third of all the space! This is a flat out rip-off, that was space that could have had candy! Not to mention that it isn't even a brand that we'd ever heard of, so it does us zero for nostalgia. Furthermore, there are more suckers in the box than anything else! I feel like this box, which should have been very easy, was completely thrown together without much thought and is complete garbage, especially as most of the candy is still available in stores.

" Chocolate, Chocolate, and More.",5,"First off, I don't usual spend time to write product reviews, but I felt obligated to in this case. Despite the few negative reviews I had seen, and the low expectations that ensued, I found myself pretty pleasantly surprised when I received this gift basket earlier today. The packaging itself is solid. You get a dark-chocolate colored basket with just enough plastic wrapping to keep everything in pristine shape without being a hassle to open. There were no signs of re-purposed Jello boxes -- only a dense amount of straw lining the bottom to serve as a cushion. I thought it was a very nice touch. Now for the part that actually matters: The candy. You get a pretty well organized assortment of chocolate-themed products, varying from chocolate covered peanuts and raisins, to peanut butter cups and and marshmallow cups, and yes, there's even a few pieces of individually-wrapped dark and milk chocolate for the diehard choco-holic. This variation is well balanced so your tastebuds don't feel tired of any one particular confection. Of course, a couple items featured in this basket probably do have their comparable counterparts in your local grocer. But that's beside the point. You'll be hard pressed to create anything of a similar caliber yourself in terms of presentation and overall packaging. Executive summary: This basket was made by chocolate lovers, for chocolate lovers. I'd buy it again and most likely will when Christmas rolls around. …",16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 One word:  SMOOTHIES!,5,"Oh my goodness... If all I ever used this in was smoothies, I'd still get my money's worth. I never imagined I could drink a peanut butter smoothie without first packing my bags for a fat/calorie guilt trip! In order to get this much peanut butter flavor you'd have to add a ton of peanut butter to even perceive it in there. To the woman that said it was too pricey, I'd say that ONE peanut butter smoothie from Jamba Juice costs as much as a bag of this stuff. I'm SO glad I found this product and can't wait to see what other yummy uses I can find for it. The possibilities are endless!

" Grain-free, & the protein isn't too much too handle",5,"**Update: March 2012** I still feed this grain free kibble to my shelties, they still love it and I'm still very happy with it. I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids. For some reason, my younger sheltie's tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn't have gas at all. Woohoo! So now I'm able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to. I think I've been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy. By the way, buying directly from Superstore for this item says ""Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks"", but 1-2 days after I order I'll get an update email from Superstore saying something like ""Good news - We're able to ship this sooner than we thought! Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered."" And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering. **Original review** I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Superstore has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety? My younger sheltie has epilepsy. Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet. Canidae is only part of that diet; I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4"" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals. The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies. I know, it's complicated, right? But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this. I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty. I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had **** gland problems where she'd have an **** sac blowout at least once a month. So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed. (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.) Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has **** gland issues. Their teeth are cleaner too. I didn't want this to turn into a ""raw food is the only way to go"" preaching session, I swear! But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her **** glands work like they're supposed to. Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does. However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it. If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food. For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food. The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles. I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid. So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS. I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it. The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right? I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do. As I write this, Superstore's price is the same as my local natural pet store. As much as I'd like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it's a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Superstore.

 BEST FOOD FIND EVER!!!!,5,"Tofu Shirataki is simply amazing. Anyone who says that it tastes or smells funny has not prepared it correctly. To prepare: drain and then rinse VERY well. At this point, I prefer to cut the noodles up a bit. Boil 2-3 minutes- any longer and the pasta will become tough. Pat dry and add your favorite sauce. These taste just like pasta, but with SOOO many fewer calories. This is not just a food for people 'trying to lose weight', as other reviewers have said. This is a food for health-conscious consumers. For me, this has been the find of a lifetime. There are so many different recipes you can use them in, and they taste simply fantastic. In fact, with sauce, they taste just like pasta (and who doesn't love pasta?). I learned about Tofu Shirataki through Hungry Girl. On her web site, she has tons of low-calorie recipes using Tofu Shirataki [...] For anyone who has tried these and disliked them, please give them another try. Make sure to drain and REALLY rinse the pasta before boiling. The scent will vanish. Cutting the pasta up helps as well, since it is slightly slippery. Try it with a cheesy pasta bake, with your favorite marinara sauce, or even in soup! The options are limitless. This truly is a fantastic, fantastic product. …",26 out of 26 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",33 out of 48 users found this review helpful

 Hooray! No taste of their own.,5,"OK, here's the review: 4 oz has 6 calories, zero fat, 1 gram carbohydrate, zero sugar. 8 oz is a more realistic serving so double that. No taste or smell at all. Texture reminds me of a bean sprout-crunchy, not rubbery. They soften a bit when cooked. I stirred some into a bok choy stir fry, and they kind of disappeared into the crunchy veggies. Very filling. The bag recommends them in salads. That makes sense. I can imagine a sesame ginger dressing and some shredded carrot, no problem. $2.99 a pound where I am, from Sea Tangle Noodle Company. I think these will definitely replace some or all of my shirataki purchases. But don't plan to put spaghetti sauce on them. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 It's pretty good for certain things,3,"This flour works fine for certain things, depending on your taste preferences. It has a very strong aftertaste (kind of bitter/sour) because of the bean flour. Thus it is pretty strong in plain breads and rolls. If you don't mind that, then good for you! (My husband is pretty sensitive and can't tolerate the bean flour or taste very well.) I found it works better in cookies, chocolate or spice cakes, brownies, banana bread, and pizza dough. Because these baked goods are made with other strong flavors, they help mellow out the bean taste which can be pretty overpowering if you don't have something with which to temper it. I like the consistency of this flour better than the rice flour blend I've also been using but again, consider your taste preferences and what you'll be baking/cooking with it. …",62 out of 63 users found this review helpful

 Best Tuna I've ever eaten!,5,"I'm a 58 year old grandma, and I can say without any reservations that this is the BEST canned tuna I've ever had -- including the home-canned tuna my grandmother used to make when I was a child. Yes, it's expensive, but I guarantee you will be able to tell the difference, and the difference is worth the price to me. This product is sometimes found in health food stores, but they are really just starting to expand their distribution, and you may not be able to find it locally just yet. If you want a can of tuna that comes with just Tuna (no phosphates or hydrogenated anything), salt (low sodium) and water, try it.

" Review of Roastaroma, Cafix, Pero, and Postum",4,"I recently gave up coffee and decided to try three different coffee substitutes: Roastaroma, Cafix, and Pero. Although Cafix tasted the most like real coffee (and it tastes *a lot* like real coffee), and all three products are pretty good, Roastaroma was my favorite. It is very similar to coffee, but it doesn't quite have the bitter bite of coffee. Those of you who are looking for that slight bitterness might prefer Cafix. Roastaroma actually reminds me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate--the cinnamon and carob flavors come through pretty strongly in the drink, giving it a cinnamon-chocolatey flavor. I used to drink coffee to satisfy my sweet tooth on low calories. This drink totally fits the bill for this purpose. The Pero is pretty good, too. Like Roastaroma, it doesn't have the bitter coffee taste, but it still makes for a decent imitation of decaf. I like to drink it with cinnamon-flavored powdered creamer. Pero's a good value, too: it's strong enough that you don't need to use very much to flavor your whole drink. I drink the Pero when I'm trying to ration the Roastaroma out to myself so as not to run out. So Roastaroma has the best flavor, Cafix tastes the most like coffee, and Pero is a good back-up. A quick note on Postum: I do not care for it. I find that people who like Postum tend to be people who were never coffee drinkers. It tastes nothing like coffee. If you try Postum as a coffee substitute, you will be disappointed. …",59 out of 60 users found this review helpful

 5 paws up! Expensive but worth every single penny,5,"I lost 2 cats from kidney disease (most likely caused by melamine-tained cat food in 2007-8). When I got my new fur-baby, I swore it would never happen again. While there are several promising options that provide excellent feline nutrition AND meet mama's exacting standards, the part I hadn't factored in was having a picky cat. Most canned food has a pate-like texture... which she won't touch. There are a few sliced/chunks in gravy options... she licks up the gravy and leaves the rest. Weruva, however, she gobbles right up. Licks the plate clean - even the flavors with peas and other veggies. I'm super impressed with this food - it meets my standards for food safety (grain free; human-grade; no yucky additives for color/odor/flavor; free range; hormone/antibiotic free, etc.) AND the darned cat will actually eat it. A few bonus features for this food: - It's the only canned cat food I've found that doesn't make me gag when I open the can. Looks appetizing, like you've opened a can of progresso or something. - Pleasant to non-existent odor when I open the can, spoon the food onto a plate, etc. My small apartment appreciates this! - If any shreds remain on the plate, doesn't gross me out to wash with the same sponge I use on my own dishes. - The... err.. end results in the litter box are also nearly non-existent as far as odor goes. My small apartment definitely appreciates this! I haven't tried her on any of the fish flavors (I can't stand the smell of fish at all and I'm not a fan of the Menadione that must be added to fish-based cat food), but here's my cat's expert opinion on the flavors she has tried: Paw Lickin' Chicken: Just plain and simple, shredded chicken breast in a light clear gravy. I think this is the one she gets least excited about, so I don't feed it too often. Grandma's Chicken Soup: One of her favorites. This flavor tends to have much more liquid and less meat than the others so I wouldn't use it as a primary food. However, I like to rotate this one regularly and feed it more often in warmer weather to ensure she's getting enough moisture. Also contains peas, carrots, & pumpkin. Funky Chunky: Probably her 2nd favorite. Similar to Grandma's Chicken Soup, but much less broth/gravy and much more meat. This one also has peas, carrots, pumpkin, and the shreds of meat are larger. Nine Liver: Her 3rd favorite, which surprised me. Shredded chicken breast and chicken liver, no veggies. The liver pieces are actually fairly small tidbits, not huge chunks like they look to be in the photos. Green Eggs and Chicken: Shredded chicken breast, peas, spinach, and little bits of egg. She isn't as fond of this one, so I've stopped buying this flavor. Pretty sure it's the egg she doesn't like, as she does like another flavor that contains spinach. Peking Ducken: By far, her favorite. Shredded chicken breast, small tidbits of duck breast, pumpkin. I was quite surprised by how much she loved this flavor -especially since I only bought the first can of Peking Ducken on a whim. (It would be one of the more expensive flavors!) On the Cat Wok: Another favorite. This one has shredded chicken breast and shredded beef, with pumpkin. Steak Frites: Shredded beef, sweet potato, & pumpkin. She prefers ""On the Cat Wok"" so I think she's not as fond of beef, but she's content to eat this flavor about once a week. I serve Grandma's Chicken Soup, Funky Chunk, 9 Liver, and Peking Ducken in heavy rotation, tossing in the occasional can of On the Cat Wok, Steak Frites, and Paw Lickin' Chicken. If your cat is extremely picky, I suggest trying Paw Lickin' Chicken. If you feed fish, I've heard that Mack & Jack is the kind cats like the most. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 Zico Coconut Water,5,"Zico's taste is the best of all the pre-packaged young coconut water I've tried. Nothing beats fresh young coconut water straight out of the coconut, but this comes close to the flavor. Don't waste your time on canned coconunt water - it's awful IMO. Zico has a lower sugar content than the other brands I've sampled (14gms/serving vs. 20gms/seving). It is isotonic, high in potassium and rich in electrolytes. You can practically live on it! If you have an upset stomach, it settles it immediately. I have an aunt who was hospitalized and unable to eat. Her potassium levels were very low. She was able to drink this and keep it down. It helped improve her postassium levels and settled her nausea. A friend of my 9 yrs. old son's had a ""tummy"" ache while we were at the state fair.

 As ineffective for me as sugar-free Red Bull...,1,"First off, let me repeat what a few other reviewers have remarked: different people are likely to have somewhat varied reactions to this product. And some background: In the past I've had both Red Bull and Sugar-free Red Bull. Red Bull works wonders for me. If I take it at 10pm, I have great focus and concentration and I can stay up working all night long through to the morning. But Sugar-free Red Bull has no effect on me whatsoever. I can take it at 10pm and fall asleep 10 minutes later. '5-Hour Energy' has a very similar effect on me as Sugar-free Red Bull. Which is, basically, nothing. That said, '5-hour Energy' appears to be more likely to (1) give me a headache, (2) make me lethargic, (3) and make me want to go to sleep. So, if you are like me and need sugar for Red Bull to work for you, then likely this '5-hour Energy' drink won't do anything for you either. …",12 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 Two Paws Up!,5,"My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them. But I needn't have worried, they loved it! The Tuna Too Cool is a rich-looking, reddish pate with lots of jelly on top and my twosome were wolfing their portions down and got into a bit of a scuffle over the last couple of mouthfuls.

 Consistently good quality flax meal,5,"I got the 4-pack some time ago, and I've been adding the flax meal to different foods. The omega-3 oil increase definitely is beneficial especially if you're vegetarian, or if you simply eat a lot. Some good ways to incorporate this healthy stuff into your diet: - Soup. Don't cook it into the soup, or you'll break down the Omega-3's - apparently cooking destroys the benefit according to what I read about flaxseed oils. Add it to the soup around when you add cheese or croutons - Sauces and chutneys. Indian cilantro or mint chutney can hold a lot of flaxseed meal without its taste being affected. Likewise for hot sauces, salsas and so on. - Waffles. The flaxseed meal becomes a kind of solid fat that enrichens the waffle. I add it to regular, chocolate, or oatmeal flour waffles. Yes, the waffle maker may affect the flaxseed meal directly in contact with the hot plates, but the rest of the fsm is not exposed to as much heat. - As they suggest, breads of all kinds. - If you're grilling a cheese sandwich, might as well up the fiber content and get whatever Omega-3's as you can salvage. Stick it in the cheese. - Believe it or don't it incorporates into nachos and pizzas too. If that's all your kid eats, maybe a flaxseed meal infusion will help (but do fix the food habits, fsm is not a fix-all) DON'T: - Try to eat it plain, I tried it, and it's about as disgusting as trying to drink vegetable oil, plus it has fiber - Add it to stuff that is still cooking. No benefit, the fat changes to regular unhealthy Omega-6 with the high heat from contacting the pan surface - Overdo adding fsm to stuff. I tried to push the envelope, and if you overdo it, the food tastes slick and even a bit soapy, kind of like it's gone bad. - Add it to clear liquids or foods. Sounds obvious, but once you feel a benefit (it can take a week or so) you can get carried away. The last thing you want is to be disgusted by it. …",33 out of 33 users found this review helpful

That's all it takes to make a quart of lovely vanilla ice cream. I decrease the fluid and replace with fresh chopped cherries and later chocolate chips when the mixture has thickened for a wonderful ice cream that has all my friends begging for more. Since I use 2% milk and sometimes no cream at all, my finished product is much lower calorie than pre-made ice cream and just as good.

 best dry cat food available,5,"I work in a specialty pet store that carries a wide range of high quality products for both cats and dogs. I spend a lot of my time looking at ingredients and researching brands so that I can pass my knowledge onto my customers. Natures Variety Instinct is the best quality food on the market, even when compared to other great foods like Orijen, Wellness Core, or Health Extension. Keep in mind that these other foods (with the exception of Science Diet, Iams, and other big store brands) are also very healthy for your pet and are loaded with high quality ingredients. I personally feed my cats Health Extension because it's the best food you can get for the price. However, if you want the absolute best, this is it. A look at the first four ingredients will tell you why. They're all ""meals"", which is essentially meat that has been ground up and dehydrated to around 10 percent moisture as opposed to 75 percent. Some fats are also removed because meat this compressed would have too high a fat percentage otherwise. Though ""meals"" do often contain other part of the animal humans wouldn't consider ""meat"", it doesn't matter to cats or dogs and is actually more nutritious. This food also contains rabbit organs, a few fruits and vegetables, and two different kinds of probiotics. As for taste, I just opened a sample bag and gave some dry food to my cats. They're currently on my table clawing at the bag to get to what's left of it. They absolutely love the food. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful

" For a Healthy Dog, Avoid This Dog Food",1,"One of the ingredients on the label is ""Natural Flavors"" which is glutamate in hiding. Glutamate is a neuro toxin which can destroy your dog's health. The company is very deceptive. They avoid giving a direct answer. They call glutamate a vegetable extract which it indeed is, however, when one component is extracted, it creates an imbalance that can be harmful. I will say this. My dogs like it, but that is the purpose of glutamate, a flavor enhancer. Added later: Why should anything need to be extracted to enhance the flavor of quality food for pets or humans for that matter. I now make many of my dogs meals from mostly raw ingredients and give them Organix dog food when I need a quick meal.

 good,3,"How you feel about Pike Place may be relative to how you feel about Starbuck's policy. Years ago you would walk into Starbucks, at least right outside New York City, where I am based, and each week there was another type of coffee being made. A lot of these, Sululasi, Africa, New Gunnua Peaberry, for example, you don't see anymore. Starbucks has made Pike their centerpiece. Usually they brew this and a bold, say Gold Coast, in the morning, and then only Pike at night. Pike Place was the first Starbucks Store that opened in Seattle in 1971. And it is a good workman's cup of coffee: far more bold and flavorful than Maxwell House or any non gourmet brew. It has a distinct coffee bean flavor without the loud nuances of a Verona or the French Roast. That is the problem I have with Pike Place. I am not sure if they are trying for more mass appeal--trying to get the truck driver who goes to the Quick Check into Starbucks by making a more mainstream blend---or if they are trying to save money after their stock price crashed in 2008. (I owned it, and I can't tell you that story because there are too many words you can't say on Superstore. From 36 to seven--KERPLUNK. I won't go into how the tractor mower was involved) Either way, this is my least favorite of the Starbucks blends.

" Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Bread Mix -- Good Product, Worth Breaking Out the Bread Machine For",3,"Being a Bob's Red Mill fan, I bought Red Mill Low-Carb Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4) on a whim to try it. I have a bread machine, but hadn't used it it a long while (like many folks, I suspect). Plus, I have been watching carbs but I love bread. If you are a fan of low-carb bread (if it's possible to be a fan of anything low-carb), I think you will enjoy this product. It produces a large loaf of fluffy, light but a bit chewy bread -- great for slicing or tearing up by hand. It has a nice wheaty taste and doesn't have that cardboardy consistency/taste that many low-carb products have. It uses half-and-half as one of its ingredients, which I think makes it fluffy. My only quibble: I have a two-pound bread machine and the bread consistently overflows the top of the machine at the end of the baking cycle -- creating a mushroom-like top to the loaf. So, the top is a bit underdone. I am going to try baking it in the regular oven the next time and see if that is better. Again, Bob's Red Mill products aren't cheap, but they are very high quality and the four packages produce four large loaves of bread that stay fresh for quite a while and travel well.

I get her a couple of boxes a month and she loves it. I have tried it and here is my take on this blend: The body (or ""mouth-feel"") is light to medium. The acidity is medium-low so it won't have too much of a bite, especially of you use cream. The flavor is surprisingly complex with some spice (maybe cardamom or anise and a little pepper) as well as a rich coffee finish. This will not replace my favorite dark roasts but I will keep it on hand for those guests who find a ""Starbucks-type"" of coffee too strong or bitter. If you, like my mother, enjoy a ""regular"" blend I don't think that it get's better than this. …",48 out of 49 users found this review helpful

 Safe for small dogs,5,"I read a few reviews on here as well as on other customer review sites that said that EVO was meant for working dogs only and that small dogs don't do well on it because of the high protein level which could lead to kidney problems. I have 3 yorkies doing very well on EVO, but I emailed Innova with these concerns anyway. This was the reply: ""Dear pet lover, Thank you for contacting us about our products. In long-term feeding studies, EVO has performed extremely well and no adverse conditions have been detected. Further, there have been a number of myths promulgated regarding links between protein and kidney failure, aging, and other health related issues. Repeated research studies have simply not been able to substantiate these myths: Quite the opposite. Much of this work has led us to a better understanding of the role that high quality proteins have on health, disease prevention, and even recovery. The EVO is perfectly safe for smaller breed dogs as well as being suitable for puppies. Please feel free to contact me if you need any additional information or if you have any questions.

 Good taste but secretly  DECAF,3,Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning. Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this. Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale. …,13 out of 15 users found this review helpful

" Neatly packed, efficiently cut, perfect for batch sizes for the home sausage chef",5,"This was my first time ordering casings on Superstore, and I am extremely pleased with this purchase. Previously I've ordered sausage casings from Butcher Supply stores, and while the prices were agreeable, the casings were clearly designed with large quantities of sausage in mind, and usually arrived in large bags of saltpack, tangled up worse than a rats nest of TV cables. These however, come neatly packaged in a small, re-usable and re-sealable pouch. Any excess casings can be tossed back in with some kosher salt and be re-used quite easily. The casings also come pre cut in 10ft long strips which are just about the right size for stuffing small batches of sausage. Cooks looking to make batches greater than 5lbs will probably be turned off by this, but for someone like me who only has a kitchenaid mixer for my sausage stuffer, it's just the right size and length to work with. Overall, a fantastic product, and I'll be ordering more soon. …",93 out of 93 users found this review helpful

 Humm... I changed my mind,4,"""Well this is not the tastiest tea, nor is it the most effective. I would say that diet and eating proper foods works much better than drinking tea made of raspberry leaves, although I am still using it, I hope it is helping.""

 Mild sweet tea,5,I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose. Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth. I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.

 My bassett hound LOVES his food now...,5,"Canidae has definetly proven to be a tasty, balanced source of food for my dog. Initially i had started my new pup on IAMS because of its popularity - but after reading the ingredient list and hearing the the IAMS corporation had just been sold (therefore not keeping the quality of their product) I decided I needed to provide my hound with a heathier source of nutrition. I volunteer at the local Human Society Shelter and a friend of mine there suggested that I try ""Canidae"". At first I was hesitant because of the cost - but when i read the nutrition facts and saw REAL, all natural ingredients, i felt confident enough that the price was worth it. Before i started feeding my bassett Canidae he would only eat once a day (placing a full bowl of food down for him in the early morning on my way to work...he would wait until late at night to eat AFTER I had my dinner and slowly munch on a couple bits here and there). The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food. Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime. Occasionally I will cook up some frozen vegetables with an egg and mix it in his food for a little variety, but I havent had to do that in a while. If you love your dog and care about his/her nutrition, I suggest giving Canidae a try. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Why would anyone buy these?,2,"I bought these to try out based on good Superstore reviews which made them sound like some kind of wonder bars that were healthy and would make you happy for eternity (or something). I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain: These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like ""gluten free"" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat). In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients. Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing. …",2 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Zola and migraine,5,"This is a long message. I apologize for its length. I would like to communicate my experience with Zola Acai Blueberry. I started drinking it, and the other two drinks in this series, Zola Acai Plain and Zola Acai Pineapple, several months ago, before they switched over to their new processing and bottling procedures. I tried all three drinks, and eventually became addicted to Zola Acai Blueberry. When they switched over to their new methods, I was at first disappointed, because I was used to the old taste and composition, but the contents were exactly the same, and I quickly became addicted to the new. It's by far my favorite drink, and I have to stop myself from drinking more than 3 bottles each day. All that is fine, but it's not the real story. The real story is that it changed my life, because for at least the 8 years previous to that I had suffered from life-crushing migraines. I was a classic migraine sufferer, with perhaps two major migraines each month that completely incapacitated me for 20 hours each time once they began. During that time I could do no more than sit up and fast with my back against the wall and legs raised up to bed height, in total darkness, with no noise, and in excruciating pain. It was impossible to do anything but sit there in total darkness and silence for 20 hours, trying to doze off as much as possible to escape the pain, and just watching the clock frantically waiting for the expected 20 hours to end my misery. I could not lie down on the bed, because that made the pain even worse. In between these major bouts of horror, I had numerous smaller migraines of various sizes. On most days I had migraines. Sometimes they forced me to lie in total darkness and silence for hours, sometimes they permitted me to work, read, or watch TV, but I was almost never free of headache for more than one or two days per week. On most nights I went to bed sitting up, to minimize the pain. When I started drinking Zola Acai, I noticed within a week that my migraine condition had suddenly improved a lot. As more days went by, it became increasingly undeniable that this was no random fluctuation. When a couple of rainy days came and I had no migraine, I knew that something really remarkable had happened. At that point I began a serious analytical effort trying to discover what was the cause of the sudden relief I was now experiencing. After some two to three weeks I had eliminated everything but the Zola Acai, of which, at that time, I was drinking perhaps 3 or 4 bottles per week. I searched on Google for some indication that acai could help a migraine, but ultimately found insufficient to my satisfaction. Meanwhile I kept increasing my intake, and the more I did, the more relief I got. I also began checking on the other ingredients of the same drink. I took a hard look at the 24 mg of guarana berry (natural caffeine) that is in each bottle. When I checked on Google I found a number of entries pointing to guarana as helpful for migraine. Gradually, I became convinced that it wasn't the acai at all that was giving me the relief, but the guarana. At that point, I purchased a large bottle of guarana tablets from sourcenaturals (or more specifically, from the Life Extension foundation, which purchased them from sourcenaturals). Each tablet has 200 mg of guarana caffeine in it. I cut each in half, and began taking half a guarana tablet each day (the dosage on the bottle recommends 3 full tablets, 600 mg, for ""energy"" each day, and says not a word about migraine). I have continued drinking the Zola Acai, so I get about 150 to 175 mg of guarana caffeine per day in all. I rarely drink coffee, and seldom even tea. This regimen has all but removed migraines from my life. I have recommended Zola and guarana tablets enthusiastically to many people, but most people I know don't have migraines, and I am not sure that anyone has ever taken me up on it so far, so I don't know the results. When I can no longer afford Zola, I have reason to believe I will be fine on the guarana tablets alone, although I expect that I will probably have to up the intake each day to a full tablet (200 mg). Meanwhile, I keep drinking the Zola Acai Blueberry because I love it. I've tried other acai drinks, but they don't even begin to match up for me in taste and satisfaction. It's necessary to emphasize that my experience is totally anecdotal, that of one man, me. I know of no scientifically controlled studies to confirm what I'm saying. As far as I am aware, there aren't any, at least not yet. For perhaps 2 years prior to that I tried feverfew, which has given partial relief to some subjects in controlled studies, but I could not claim any relief from it, and finally just gave it up. Over-the-counter headache drugs, which have given some relief at times to others, just made my migraines worse. I no longer get the life-crushing migraines that plagued my life for years. I have gotten some two or three migraines during the last 6 months, evidently due to extreme insufficient sleep 2 to 3 nights in a row. These attacks lasted up to 20 hours each, but were not enough to stop me from writing, reading, going on the Internet, and watching videos. For someone used to real migraines, these were far from serious. Please spread this message as much as you can. I do not know how many it will help or not help, but it recounts an experience that has literally changed my life. Please include the whole message, if possible, and point out that this experience is as yet entirely anecdotal, so I have no idea how many people it might help and how many not. Migraines can come from entirely different sources, and there is little doubt that there are many migraine sufferers whom it not help at all. But the change was so sudden, dramatic, and emphatic in my own life, that it's hard not to expect that there will be others who will find a comparable relief. By the way, the price on Superstore is unexpectedly low. The cheapest I have found in New York City is $2.49/bottle at this time, minus 10% for an order over $150.00. That was at Whole Foods. Superstore's price is even lower, especially on small orders, and the best I have seen. I have no relation at this time other than as a customer to Superstore , Source Naturals, Life Extension Foundation, or Zola, Inc. Eugene …",20 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 Too weak to be called a concentrate,1,"The reviews for this product are confusing and not accurate. Mr. Wu, says this is 13.6% Triclopyr which is incorrect since the manufacturer clearly says ""Active Ingredients: Triclopyr, triethylamine salt: 0.8%"". Also the description calls this a ""concentrate"" yet there is no information about how much working solution this so-called concentrate makes. The description also says ""convenient no mix formula"" which implies it is used right out of the bottle so it can't be a concentrate. Again Mr. Wu says he uses 50 to 100% stronger mix, but this can't be a description of this product since it is a no mix formula and any mixing would reduce the concentration, i.e., there is no way to make it stronger. It appears that Mr. Wu has pasted his description of another product into the space for this one and that is not helpful.

 Tender jerky - who knew?!,5,"I prefer jerky on the tender side, so I really enjoyed the original Wild Ride natural style, but I also don't have any hangups about additives, so the new Cowboy Strips line totally blows away the flavor of the bigger brands I'm used to; same tenderness as the organic Wild Ride stuff, but with even more taste. And if you haven't tried the Pepper yet, you're missing out! …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Diabetics' perfect midnight snack,5,"These were recommended in the class I took when 1st Dxed with diabetes. They work well whenever you don't want to eat more (dieting), or when you won't eat for hours; that includes overnight to help avoid high sugar levels when you wake. In fact, they're very good at helping me get a full night's sleep, uninterrupted by waking up to eat a snack. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 A Rich Flower Garden in Bloom.,5,"A Ming Dynasty (AD 1368 - 1644) creation believed to lower cholesterol and promote longevity, jasmine tea consists of Chinese green tea leaves - usually green teas from Fujian province, which is also home to the semi-fermented Oolong and smoky Lapsang Souchong - scented with jasmine flowers. Traditionally, the flowers are harvested during the day and stored in a cool place until nightfall, when they develop their full fragrance. They are then layered over the tea leaves, which have previously been steamed or heated to prevent their oxidation. The tea's quality is determined both by the quality of the green tea used as its base and by the effectiveness of the scenting process. Brewed, it has a delicate, silvery color and a rich fragrance reminiscent of a flower garden in bloom. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 This wild Alaskan salmon is right off the hook good ...,5,"If you are a fan of specialty smoked salmon or prefer to select your fish at a seafood counter you may not care for Bear & Wolf. This is almost right off the hook good. It has that ""fishy"" taste that I actually prefer, but if you serve this up to those who don't care for it you'll be getting a thumbs down. If you've tried the Kirkland brand, which is delightfully pink and flaky, you might be taken aback when you see and taste something from the wild. I do not like most canned salmon because it is farmed ... some farming conditions are less than optimal (such a turn off). This is wild Alaskan salmon that crumbles when you take a fork to it. On the label it says, ""Satisfaction Guaranteed or your money refunded."" If you like that right off the hook taste, you'll love it.

" Great value, great flavor",5,"Best value I've found after years of searching. This pepper is stronger and more flavorful than anything you'll ever find in the supermarket, and is reasonably priced. You can use a little less than normal if you like, since the pepper flavor is so much more pronounced than you're probably used to. But I like to use my normal amount and thoroughly enjoy the great pepper flavor. As long as you have a good pepper mill and grind it fresh, this is really the best I've found. …",15 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Should be called Maple Flakes!,1,I bought a 6 pack case of this when it first came out and liked it so much I set up a subscription. Half way through my second order I finally asked my wife if the cereal seemed to have less pecans and less bunches. When I asked she told me she was wondering the same thing. Well I just received my third case and I have no need to ask anyone. My first bowl had almost no pecans in it and no crunchy clusters. Just to be sure this wasn't a fluke of a bowl I pulled the cereal from the box and found myself staring at what looked like a plain bran flake cereal. I really had to look hard to see anything other than bran flakes. I'm very disappointed with what started off as a very good cereal. My subscription has been cancelled. …,10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 WONDERFUL PRODUCT FOR WHEN YOU ARE SNOWED IN,5,"I wanted to make cupcakes, but out of eggs. I only use prime shipping usually. So, I checked and there was only the large sizes of powdered eggs on Superstore in the 50.00 range. Checked again a few days later and found these, so bought 2. Glad smaller packages are available. I was able to make my cupcakes. Still have most of the first bag left too. It looks well processed and clean and just like real powdered eggs that it is. No additives. Will be buying more. Shipping was quick, and that is important to me. I am anxious to try scrambling some to see if they taste like fresh eggs. I will do a follow-up if I do. …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Maybe overrated?,3,"I might be used to higher standards of honey -- please don't get me wrong, it is not a bad honey, but I specifically purchased it because of its high ratings. It does have a distinct flavor with higher sweetness and definitively better than any of these honeys you can find in any ""normal"" supermarket, however if you compare it to a Eucalytus honey (in this case from Australia), ""wild flower"" honey from Germany it doesn't add up. …",6 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 I wanted to love it based on the hype ...,1,"... unfortunately, I was totally disappointed when using Droste. I looked high and low for it too, and paid $8/box thinking I would have an outstanding product. The finished 14"" square X 4"" high layer cake was very moist, but lacked the darker and richer chocolate expectations both in color and taste. In addition, it also allowed for the cinnamon taste to lean forward - which under the previous chocolate used, was considerably the faint surprise that flavor was meant to be. Droste may be wonderful for making devil's food, but did not hold up for the darker, richer chocolate that I was hoping for. I was very disappointed considering all the hype. But, I truly appreciate these posts. They are a source of helpful input, inspiration, and the kindliness of sharing one's experience. I appreciate all the information especially the comparisons to other cocoa powders. …",12 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Low. Low. I repeat: Low.,1,"I'm not stupid. I have nearly a degree from a major university. I read this description over and over, and still it didn't make any sense. Ten bars! Pack of two! Two boxes! Forty-eight! Hike! Like me, you'll probably be surprised by the dearth of product. You get two boxes. Each contains five packets. Each packet has 2 bars, sure -- but the weight of each packet is 1.5 oz, which is less than two-thirds the weight of ONE regular Clif bar. These bars are maybe 1 1/2"" wide, 4"" long, and 1/4"" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think. Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 A *must-have* household staple,5,"This sauce is medium heat for everyday use. It has an excellent roasted pepper flavor, and there is *NO VINEGAR* to get in the way. Consequently, you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce...versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it. An every-day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue. This is not a boutique novelty, it's a household staple. The 32 oz. size is the right size for a hot sauce household. You want good? Try Tapatio on cottage cheese. You'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again, I promise. I use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream, but my personal favorite applications of Tapatio are: eggs potatoes pizza anything creole (forget tabasco!) cottage cheese most rice mac cheese and of course...Mex In my opinion, this is the best sauce in your local grocery store. …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 Yum!  Tastes like fresh-brewed Starbucks... hot or iced... so convenient,5,"PIcked it up after tasting it in the store, and have been enjoying it all week. Cannot be any easier -- no cleaning the coffee machine anymore, yeaaaah! Hot water, dump it in, and mmmm.... and I normally HATE any instant coffee. This is unlike any instant I've tried, and really does taste as good as Starbucks in the store. The best part is that you don't need hot water... you can add cold water and ice for an awesome iced coffee. Am going to try the decaf bc I'm obviously drinking a lot more coffee now that I've discovered this. …",25 out of 30 users found this review helpful
 Better than Starbucks espresso pods,5,"Using the Briel Chamonix machine I purchased from Superstore, I have produced delicious lattes using these pods. The smell of the Espressione pods (regular and decaf) when opened is incredible - dark, rich roasts. FYI - the pods are produced in Italy, which is a good sign. Also, each pod has a handy paper ""tab"" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers. I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite. Only one warning: 150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you're going to store them. More good news: each box of 150 is stamped with a ""best if used by"" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase. …",23 out of 25 users found this review helpful
 Do you like Aspartame and MSG?,1,This isn't a bash on Nutiva's product specifically but more of a warning to the greater community. I found out the hard way that all Protein Powders basically contain Aspartame and MSG. This is because the Aspartate and Glutamate in the products are in free form and are rapidly absorbed by the body. If you have any allergies or issues with neurotoxins buyer beware. …,3 out of 29 users found this review helpful
