 Please avoid!!,1,"Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats. Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients. They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food. This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school. Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness. Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. try something like orijen or evo. …",9 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Terrible customer service,1,"I purchased this through Superstore and it was shipped from Starbucks . I received the order promptly, however when I opened the shipping box, I found the product box with a round blue sticker over the broken seal that keep the product box sealed. Inside, there was coffee grounds all over the box and stuck to all the packets was this gritty stuff. There were 2 sleeves of VIA that were obviously opened and causing the mess in the box. Each of these packets also had a blue sticker! So it was pretty obvious that I was shipped a known defective product. When I called Starbucks, at first they wouldn't help me and treated me like they didn't ship this item (because I ordered thru Superstore) and would not replace this product. They said I would have to pay to ship it back to them and they would send a refund. I didn't want a refund, I just wanted the product replaced. They said that after I returned it, I would have to completely reorder and pay for the product. I called the customer service again and got the run-around. There customer service is awful. I guess they figure they can afford to lose a customer if they behave this way. That is why I am posting this review.... I would not recommend buying from Starbucks. …",10 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Lavazza Coffee,5,"Just made the first pot this Saturday morning for the wife and myself. Used a burr type coffee grinder and used my drip type coffee maker. Used (3) scoops for 10-cups of coffee. The aroma was great, the brew was dark and rich and the taste was superb. So good as a matter of fact that we made an additional pot. If you like a hearty and fulfilling cup of coffee I highly recommend this coffee. …",15 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 They changed the Chips now they taste horrible,1,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy. I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan. About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket. I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it. After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to. They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed. So I e-mailed Kettle with the following: ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering."" I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag. This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks. Please let me know if I can be of any more help."" Well the next bag was good. Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost. I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company. So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle. Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand. increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand. Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same... …",20 out of 27 users found this review helpful
" A Horse Is a Horse Is a Snack, Of Course",4,"My dog is constantly out to get me. Keeping little miss 'Princess Paws' from rooting through the trash, diddling the carpets or wrecking the house is like trying to keep Lindsey Lohan out of dive bars, crack dens and paparazzi mug shots. In other words -- nearly impossible. But lord help me, I try. I bought a bag of these biscuits, thinking I could coax the mutt into good behavior through 'positive reinforcement'. Though the idea sort of fizzles when the dog is too finicky to eat the stupid things. She gave the tiniest of disinterested exploratory sniffs, then scrunched her furry little schnozz like I was offering her a handful of barf-encrusted ****. (Which, based on her previous dietary choices, she would actually eat. Tasty baked tidbit? No, thanks; I'm trying to keep my greyhoundish figure. The poop du jour in half-digested BLEEEH-rnaise sauce? Mmmm-mmmm! Bon appeturd!) I tried to entice her, but she wasn't having it. I even tried a little nibble myself, to prove I wasn't trying to poison her. (Yet.) And actually, the biscuit was pretty good. It's got a nice crunch, with a taste somewhere between a heavy water cracker and reconstituted horse meal. But pretty light on the 'horse meal' part. All in all, not bad. I'd give it about a four on the people-food scale -- somewhere between a stale bag of Funyuns and a plain rice cake eaten off a sweaty Clydesdale's back. I finished the first one and had another. Pretty soon I'd gone through half the bag. So this was a complete waste for the dog. But I found a new snack for TV nights. Now if I'm out of popcorn, I set out a bowl of biscuits and munch away. They're not gourmet. But they're filling, and I'm getting my recommended daily allowance of hoof meat all in one sitting. That's a winner. …",9 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Buy the ORIGINAL BACONNAISE not the LITE flavored one!,5,"Hey Bacon Lovers, The original BACONNAISE is absolutely delicious! There is NOTHING else like it on store shelves! No, I am not the maker of this product or associated with it in any way other than being a HAPPY CUSTOMER! YUMMMY! The LITE Baconnaise, just like most calorie restricted products, doesn't taste as great as the original, fattier Baconnaise! I suggest you go to J&D's website & buy the original BACONNAISE and not the lite variety. I was hooked on FAST FOOD, especially McDonald's Big Macs! I got a jar of original Baconnaise (looks darker than the lite jar that is pictured here) after seeing it featured on Oprah. It was LOVE AT FIRST BITE! Although it's NOT a diet food, I have lost almost 10 pounds in only 3 weeks because I'd rather eat at home using my Baconnaise than grab something at the drive-thru! I especially like a lean Roast Beef sandwich with Baconnaise. No fast food means no french fries or super sized Coke, so I think that's why I'm dropping the pounds! Financially, we're saving a lot of CASH $$$ because I have DISCOVERED something that makes me SATISFIED with what I'm putting in my mouth. Does that make sense? Seriously, it costs us about $20 a fast food meal & we used to eat out several times a week. We still do pizza every so often, but fast food has lost its allure! I even went so far as to dab on some Baconnaise on a stalk of (ugh) broccoli yesterday & it was EAT-ABLE for once! I can assure you I am NOT a veggie eater AT ALL! Thanks to this tasty product, I now have hope that I can break my ADDICTION to fast food. Even eating some veggies is NOW a possibility (almost an unbelievable statement from a junque food junkie!) I took the time to write this because I could NOT believe the negative reviews and wanted to CLARIFY for all of those thinking about trying Baconnaise to purchase the ORIGINAL Baconnaise formula. It has HELPED ME a great deal & I am now hooked for life! Good Luck & Happy Eats! :D …",17 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 A little weak but tastes pretty decent,3,"I just received this product today and although I've been disappointed with K-Cups that weren't coffee or tea in the past (like hot cocoa and sweet tea) I figured I'd give these a shot since it was only $9.99 for 24. I drank it hot, although you can also brew it over ice for a cold drink. Immediately after brewing I noticed it looked a little weak in the cup, but it smelled pretty good. My reaction to my first sip was a bit on the ""bleh"" side. The caramel taste was a little odd and a touch sickly sweet. However, as I drank a little more it grew on me. It's certainly not like heating up a nice cup of real cider from a farm, but it's more convenient, it doesn't go bad, and makes a decent little cup of cider on a nice chilly evening. For $9.99 I recommend giving it a shot. Don't go all out and buy the 3-pack of 18 cups right off the bat though. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" "" A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!""",5,"I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try ""Natural Calm""; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot. I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because ""Natural Calm"" does the job. I've been taking ""Natural Calm"" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff. As for negatives to ""Natural Calm""...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick. All in all 5+ stars. ""Natural Calm"" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer. …",39 out of 47 users found this review helpful

 Watch out for protein poisoning,3,"I understand that most of the reviews are fake and I would like to say that while I find them all very enjoyable and humorous, there is a something that a real customer of this product feels should be known. I purchased 10 of the rabbits for the purpose of making hare jerky (a tasty treat) when I was overcome with the desire to indulge in a bit of rabbit meat before the smoking process. Giving into my guilty urges, I took one rabbit for my own personal pre-jerky consumption and proceeded to eat the entire animal whole (I do not own a stove, only a plastic box and some firewood for smoking things, hence it was uncooked). After my little personal rabbit fiesta, I laid down to digest the food. This was a mistake. Within two hours, I had never felt worse. I used the trusty search engine ""Bing"" to do some armchair medical research while clutching a trashcan in the most horrendous gastric distress you can imagine (I do not have health insurance so I did not call the hospital). Quickly, I found out that a side effect to eating rabbit was ""protein poisoning,"" a situation that arises when lean meat is eaten. It is also known as ""rabbit starvation"" because rabbit meat contains almost no fat whatsoever. Apparently, consumption of large amounts of protein with little or no carbohydrates or fat is dangerous. Well you imagine how much that tickled me angry. All ready to write an angry letter of protest to the rabbit meat industry about their marketing of a dangerous foodstuff, I stumbled to my writing desk but alas, I only made it 3 feet before collapsing in pain. The next 5 hours were like a blur as I lay on the floor writhing in my own waste seeing people and things from the past and quite possibly the future. I have experimented with drugs back in the day and let me tell you, nothing came as close to disconnecting me from the universe in the worst way possible, as this. No one ever wants to experience protein poisoning, I promise you. At about 10 in the evening I came to and used a chair and the wall to help pull myself off of the floor. I still felt sick and I went back to my computer to see if there was a cure. Suddenly it hit me, I needed to eat other macronutrients! I remembered the tub of lard I had been saving in the fridge and stumbled across my apartment. The pain only grew worse. I remembered reading that bodybuilders eat lots of protein. I have no idea how they do it. It must be horrible for them. My vegan friend has always said that anything over 20 grams of a protein a day is overkill and I'm inclined to believe him now. He is the healthiest person I know, he is very skinny but he doesn't have visible muscle (which he says is the result of toxins and not enough body fat to properly survive). I finally reached my fridge and reached in for the I Can't Believe It's Not Butter container with my stockpiled lard. I quickly shoveled it into my mouth and wouldn't you believe it but it only made me feel worse! I passed out again, the cold air of the fridge blowing onto me. I awoke three days later (according to my watch) at 7 at night. The fridge had apparently preserved my body as it fought the proteins for the first night but now my electricity was off because my bill was due yesterday. It didn't matter, my body had apparently started to win the fight around 2 nights ago and now I am pretty much back to normal. However, I SINCERELY DO NOT RECOMMEND RABBIT MEAT as it can potentially kill you, as it nearly did me. Five stars - 1 for nearly killing me - 1 slightly chewy - 1 no head + 1 made great jerky = 3 stars …",26 out of 40 users found this review helpful

 Eight O'Clock French Roast Coffee and Superstore's Subscribe and Save a Winning Combination,5,"We've enjoyed Eight O'Clock French Roast Whole Bean coffee daily for about ten years. We love its bold taste and aroma, and, although we're not coffee connoisseurs, we've tried many different coffees and have not found any we like more at any price. The only dilemma was when we moved we were unable to purchase the 36 oz. bag in our new location. No store carries it in the 36 oz. size, only the smaller 12 oz. bag which was inconvenient since it would only last about a week, and was costly. I had located on-line vendors, but they charged a premium price to what we were used to paying before we moved, and added shipping on top of that. When traveling on business I used to buy a 3 to 4 month supply at a time to keep us in coffee. Then I learned of Superstore's Subscribe and Save program and found it at a lower price than we've ever payed, and shipping is free. So far we've received three shipments, two regularly scheduled monthly orders and one extra shipment that I ordered because we were going to run out before our regular order shipped. Superstore even emails me to let me know when my regular order will arrive and allows me to delay a shipment or place an order early if running low. We couldn't be happier with the coffee or with Superstore's Subscribe and Save program. …",16 out of 17 users found this review helpful

 I wish I had found this earlier,5,"I discovered Beet Juice when I went to Whole Foods in search of a natural source of Iron. I was eight months pregnant at the time and anemic and I have a terrible time taking synthetic iron without throwing up. Anyway, I went in looking for something and the clerk told me this was the best source. I took her word for it and took these home, and I'm glad I did. These are awesome! Within a few days of taking this I felt remarkably better. I did a bit of reading about the benefits of beet juice, and there's not much it isn't good for. Its really considered a super food its so potent as an antioxident. It is also remarkable for vein support, regulating blood sugar and blood pressure. It is also good for replacing blood after surgery and it is a powerful anticancer food. It also is really high in fiber so it counteracts the usual problem associated with taking iron--constipation. The great thing about taking the supplement is there is no way you can eat enough beets to get all these benefits, so supplementing is the way to go!! I took these on a empty stomach before bed and it never bothered my stomach. Don't hesitate to try these. In the capsule form these are easy to swallow and much cheaper than synthetic iron pills. I'm still taking them because of all the health benefits they offer. …",29 out of 29 users found this review helpful

 Low carb diet for your cat,4,"If you have a cat with diabetes consider EVO canned food since it truly does make a huge difference in their carb intake.

" Excellent brew, economical too!",5,"With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time. Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?). I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig. It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well. I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags. This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup). Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here. Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like. Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there. Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder. Ok, on to the the ekobrew. They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing. The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds. Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew. I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill. I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter. Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper. I'll be looking into getting another one of these! …",44 out of 45 users found this review helpful

" ""The best instant miso soup I've ever had.""",5,"Before detailing the added benefits of Miso-Cup, I offer the opinion of my wife, Yumi, a Japanese woman born and raised in Yokohama. ""This is the best instant miso soup I've ever had,"" she said. So, we promptly placed an Superstore Subscribe & Save order for regular shipments. What are the added benefits I noted earlier? Edward & Sons Miso-Cup is organic, gluten free and proudly displays that it contains ""NO MSG"" and is ""Vegan"" with the big ""V"". Each serving has only 60 calories. If that isn't cool enough the company offers to replace your disposable soup cup with a reusable Miso-Cup travel mug for only $3.99 with all proceeds donated to reforestation charities. You get your good deed of the day and lunch all in one! Getting back to the taste - the main reason we purchased this product - the ingredients are easy to read and understand. You get freeze-dried tofu and green onions, wakame seaweed and vegetable seasonings. There are three servings in each packet. The Miso-Cup nicely compliments a bento lunch or an order of sushi. I keep a packet in my desk drawer with a small bowl. Preparation is easy. You squeeze out the first packet of miso and stir in eight ounces of hot water until it dissolves.

 TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA  -- EXCELLENT PRODUCT & VALUE,5,"THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWERS YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA, IN A NUTSHELL: VERY GOOD TASTING ""REAL BREWER'S YEAST"" -- NOTHING ADDED This ""Genuine Brewer's Yeast"" powder tastes very good for real Brewers Yeast. Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.

 Something Unique,5,"Lapsang Souchong - 'Russian Caravan' as it is commonly known - is a truly exceptional Chinese tea, and it is done proper justice by the ladies at Culinary Teas. A generous teaspoon of Lapsang Souchong steeped for about three and a half minutes in roughly 190-200 degree water will yield a strong, flavorful cup of the Fujian Province's most notable tea. What is so respectable about Culinary Teas' Lapsang is that it manages to contain immense flavor with very little of the aftertaste common to lower-grade Lapsang Souchong. But how does it TASTE? The answer is both mysteriously complex and blindingly simple. A quick sniff of the pine-needle-roasted leaves brings forth the aroma of a campfire; this flavor carries well into the brewed tea, creating a strong, smokey aroma and flavor that does not fade as the tea cools. Culinary Teas' evenly fired, full-leaf Lapsang Souchong ought to be placed at the top of any tea enthusiast's shelf as the strongest, most impression-making tea in Culinary's collection. One does not forget the first experience with Lapsang. Do it right by using this brand. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

" Ok, but not great...",3,"I bought this thinking it was a strawberry/banana version of the small Crystal Light on the go packets with 10 calories per packet. I was a bit disappointed when I got them and they have 30 calories and 3x as much powder as the normal CL on the go packets. If you are using a new bottle of water, you have to pour some water out to make room for the mix. It also took about an hour for the powder to dissolve in the water. It settled at the bottom of my bottle and would not mix no matter how hard I shook it. I found that if you pour it in and place the bottle in the fridge for about an hour then go back to it, the water will have penetrated these clumps enough to mix in with some heavy shaking. It is nearly impossible to mix in initially. This is not a big deal for me, I will just place it mixed in my fridge overnight, but for anyone thinking they can just take a packet to work with them and mix it in at lunch will be disappointed, you will need a separate glass and spoon to mix immediately as you poor it into the water. Now for the taste...It has a decent flavor when you first take a drink, but the after taste is not good. I'll stick with my orange or raspberry lemonade CL on the go packs. …",7 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Best chai you can ever get from a bag.,5,"I have just bought this tea yesterday and made a traditional ""chai"", as I normally do. I've used other brands and types of bagged chai tea before, and they were decent, but nothing like this. I absolutely love my chai to be extremely spicy, and this is it. No other varieties of Stash Chai or even their other teas can compare to this. This is simply delicious when made with milk and sugar. Save the money you spend on a Starbucks Chai latte and buy a box instead. It's MUCH better and less expensive when made right.

 Gummi done right,5,"If I had to pick just one candy to have for the rest of my life, it would be some fameous chocolate from Europe, but if I could choose two, Haribo Fruit Salad would come in second. This is amazing candy; I never tire of it. My wife and I consume about 30 pounds a year of this stuff, and it is definitely less costly than chocolate. The six flavors are all good, if not always identifiable. What is that green flavor, anyway? Watermelon? Maybe, but definitely not citrus. The flavors I'm sure of are Orange, Lemon, Grapefruit and Cherry. There is one that is maybe peach, or maybe passion fruit. Then, there is the enigmatic green. The soft gummi candy is coated with fine granular sugar, a nice touch. Haribo sells a version of the Grapefruit flavor in a single flavor package, and though slightly different from the Grapefruit found in this mix, it is wonderful, too. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

It is very creamy and taste as close to regular Mac&Cheese that you can get from a box. It's also great because it contains almost twice as much as the other kind and since it's not a powder mix the ease allows a simple,quick dinner for my always,ever so demanding four-year old.

" ""Tres intense"" K-cup blend stronger than the usual fare",4,"Dark Magic is for coffee drinkers searching for something bolder than the breakfast blends and flavored coffees ubiquitous on supermarket shelves. Whether it will satisfy depends on what you normally buy at coffee shops. My wife favors a latte or mocha, so she found Dark Magic too strong. I prefer an Americano, so I liked this roast. I tested the Dark Magic blend on Keurig's small cup (5.25 oz) setting to capture the strongest flavor. It was a nice improvement from Green Mountain's Trade Gingerbread I drank earlier in the week. Dark Magic is bolder than Coffee Kona Blend or Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend but no more bitter. If you need more caffeine, I recommend you add a Caffeinated Black Coffee Shot . In summary, I like ""tres intense"" roasts and Mountain Coffee Dark Magic is the darkest I have found in the Keurig lineup. I will post an update should I try a stronger blend than Dark Magic.

 A fine bowl of porridge,5,"McCann's is ""just"" oatmeal, but it's perhaps the best oatmeal widely available in the United States. It's made from nothing but 100% whole grain oat kernels which are grown in Ireland and cut in a device similar to a burmill. The cutting technique provides a much firmer and more complex texture than the rolling which is used on commoditized oatmeal products available in the U.S. This is not an ""instant"" or ""quick"" oat product, and these oats have not been precooked at all. What this means is that McCann's Traditional makes a great bowl of porridge with a fresh grain flavor and an al dente consistency. This is oatmeal with a natural crunch and tang to it. Rolled oats -- especially instant, sugar-added, flavored rolled oats -- don't come close. The obverse of this is that you are actually cooking these grains rather than merely heating and stirring a pre-cooked product. Be prepared to spend some time -- a half hour or so -- in your kitchen watching over these and stirring them with your spurtle (porridge-stirring spoon). Consider this a luxury, an excuse to slow down for a while. You can find cooking ideas and great recipes at goldenspurtle dot com, which is the home page for the world porridge-making championships. Specialty porridges, made with fresh fruits, liqueurs, and cream sauces, make distinctive desserts if you really want to get creative.

 My bassett hound LOVES his food now...,5,"Canidae has definetly proven to be a tasty, balanced source of food for my dog. Initially i had started my new pup on IAMS because of its popularity - but after reading the ingredient list and hearing the the IAMS corporation had just been sold (therefore not keeping the quality of their product) I decided I needed to provide my hound with a heathier source of nutrition. I volunteer at the local Human Society Shelter and a friend of mine there suggested that I try ""Canidae"". At first I was hesitant because of the cost - but when i read the nutrition facts and saw REAL, all natural ingredients, i felt confident enough that the price was worth it. Before i started feeding my bassett Canidae he would only eat once a day (placing a full bowl of food down for him in the early morning on my way to work...he would wait until late at night to eat AFTER I had my dinner and slowly munch on a couple bits here and there). The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food. Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime. Occasionally I will cook up some frozen vegetables with an egg and mix it in his food for a little variety, but I havent had to do that in a while. If you love your dog and care about his/her nutrition, I suggest giving Canidae a try. …",18 out of 18 users found this review helpful

 Delicious Veggies Without Sunlight,5,"My parents sent me the Aerogarden so I could grow cherry tomatoes in my dark garden-less apartment. I started with the Salad Green kit that came with the unit. Within 4 weeks I had a plethora of greens to pick and eat, so plump and juicy. I just nip off a couple of leaves as I need them. Can't wait to grow my tomatoes. The unit super easy to set up, very clear directions, a real no-brainer. Simply click parts together, fill with water, plop in tablets, insert seed pods and leave it alone until it is time to eat. The seeds sprouted within 3 days and took off. I set the lights so they are on during the day until about 11 p.m. the unit really lights up the room. The Aerogarden lets you know when you need to add more water and nutrients. The air in that corner of the room feels moist which, in Southern California, is a blessing but should be kept in mind when placing the unit.

I had concerns last year and thought maybe the taste was ""off"" just on the one box. So I picked up another box last week. It's even WORSE! Since General Mills bought LaraBars (Humm Foods) three years ago, the product just seems to have gone down hill. It doesn't have the same fresh, alive taste; there is a harsh, metallic flavor that indicates whatever machinery produces the bar now is not being properly cleaned. Also the bar didn't used to be so oily to the touch. Oily, weird flavors in nut bars make me think the nuts have gone rancid. Since I am writing, I also want to say it has bugged me for years that Superstore continues to misrepresent the maker of LaraBars in the title of the product ""LaraBar"" by ""LaraBar"". I suppose this is because people who generally buy raw food product are not usually the same people who support multinational food conglomerates like General Mills.

 Bringing Zingy To an All New Level,4,"My first impression is not the initial taste on the tip of my tongue as first expected, but the powerful, almost peppery taste at the back of my throat as I sip this one down. On the second sipping, more on the tip of my tongue this time, the tea's more subtle qualities come through: the mellow side of the lemon and ginger combination--then wham again with the peppery snap at the back of my throat. This is no mildly flavored herbal, but one directly infused with ginger root, lemon peel, lemon grass and blackberry leaves. One other interesting ingredient is linden, a plant with many medicinal properties and used for such for many centuries. It would be interesting to know if it is the linden flower that is used (and most probably it was), since this is a diaphoretic, a very mild fever-inducing part of the plant when taken as a hot tea. This naturally enables the body to help fight off infections according to some sources I looked up on the web. Not to worry though--this is not a fever that will keep you from work! It's one that will make your body work for you instead. I bought this one for some relief from a sore throat and it definitely helps ease my sinus induced problem. As with any lemon-flavored beverage I've tried, it does leave a slight aftertaste of lemon, but not too strong or unpleasant. I imagine it would be quite good with honey, which I will definitely try once I get home from work. For now, a slight bit of sugar seemed to compliment the flavors nicely, even bringing them out more. This is a strong flavored herbal, not a mellow one as I've come to expect a lot of herbals to be. Drink with caution if you like your herbals on the softer side. This one's courting the wilder side of the tea experience. …",23 out of 24 users found this review helpful
" For more economical choice, check out Pill Pockets for CATS",5,"I have a 100lb dog, an Akita who HATES taking pills. She has NOT had Pill Pockets for Dogs, but she HAS had Pill Pockets for CATS. Now, before you click the ""No"" button after ""Was this review helpful to you?"", read further -- my comments will be of value to those with dogs that take SMALL pills! Andie has been taking pills for hypothyroidism for the past 9 years. Her pills are TINY. Wrapping them in meat or cheese never worked; she simply ate around the pill or spit it out. For years the only way I could get Andie to take pills was to, literally, shove them down her throat. (My hands are small enough and her mouth is big enough for me to do this. Thankfully she's a very trusting dog!) Then one day I was at the vet and noticed packages of something called ""Pill Pockets"". They had two kinds -- one for dogs and one for cats. Both came in flavors that Andie would like, but the dog Pill Pockets came in different sizes (small and large) while the cat Pill Pockets only came in one size (small). I looked at each package very carefully and noticed that the packages for cats had 45 Pill Pockets, while the packages for small dogs only had 35 Pill Pockets. And yet, the packages for small dogs cost MORE than the packages for cats -- huh? (On Superstore they are the same price, but the quantities are different.) So I looked at Andie's tiny thyroid pills, then looked at the Pill Pocket pictures on the packages and decided, ""I might as well save myself a buck and buy the kitty Pill Pockets. What the hey, Andie won't know she's eating something intended for cats!"" I've been happy with that decision ever since. I've bought both the salmon- and chicken-flavored Pill Pockets FOR CATS and Andie likes them both. The pockets are the perfect size, just big enough for her thyroid pills, and to date she has gulped down every one, then begged for another! And I like the fact that I get 10 more in each package than I would if I bought the Pill Pockets ""for dogs"". Pill Pockets are GREAT product, for cats OR dogs. I wish I had discovered them sooner! While I have never used the Pill Pockets for Dogs, I am 100% confident that they are excellent. That's why I'm giving this product 5 stars. If Andie's pills were bigger I would get the Pill Pockets for Dogs, and I know she would like them just as much. For the time being, though, I will stick with the smaller Pill Pockets for Cats, since they last a few days longer. So, this review is to pass along an idea that perhaps some dog owners had not considered: If your dog takes tiny pills like Andie does, go with the more economical choice and get Pill Pockets for Cats. Your dog will never know the difference! …",116 out of 117 users found this review helpful

 Very pleased so far,5,"Aside from digestive issues, I have suffered from adult acne in recent years. I have noticed a correlation between stress and breakouts (and that familiar female response once a month) however I have not yet found a complete system which had worked to eliminate my acne. After reading of coconut oil and Lauric acid, I have put it on trial... and have thus far experienced some impressive results..! It took about 8 days before I noticed the large cysts subsiding, and they have stayed away now for several weeks. Even my monthly cyst is keeping in check. Who would have thought rubbing your face with coconut oil twice and day and taking it internally would make the oily patches on your face actually improve? It seemed a little counter-intuitive, but so far I am experiencing some very clear skin... for the first time in years... Of course, I believe in coupling the outside assault with an internal one, so I have been taking the coconut oil daily (usually on bread or I just add it to cereal) as well as a wonderful greens mix (powder) and a pro-biotic. Of course, water is paramount, and I drink plenty every day, but I always did...

 Belgian Favorite,5,"We have lived in Belgium for 8 of the last 24 months. There is no question that the cheapest Belgian chocolate is better than anything you can buy in America. It is tough for us to gag down American chocolate anymore. They grind the cocoa beans finer and use less fat and less sugar, so it is much better for you. I am diabetic and it does not send my sugars up. Belgians have very strong opinions when it comes to which chocolate is ""best"". They don't always agree, but more Belgians said Leonida's was the best than any other single brand we heard. This is not something you eat. You savor and treasure every piece.

" Good product, cats like the duck flavor better",4,"I have three very active ferals that I tamed as kittens. They are indoor/outdoor cats and very active. One of them was throwing up his food a lot and the vet suggested it might be the grain products in the food I was feeding them. I switched to Wilderness ""Duck"" flavor and they loved it - and no more sick kitty! Then I tried this salmon flavor since my cats prefer the salmon treats mostly. One thing I noticed about the Blue Buffalo ""Wilderness"" salmon flavor is that it did not have the same pungent smell as the duck flavor ""Wilderness"" food. So I liked that! However, the kitties did not attack the salmon variety with the same gusto that they dug into the duck flavor ""Wilderness"" dry food. All in all, this is a good dry food that is great if your kitty has a sensitive stomach. As for my three, they prefer the duck flavor. …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 8oz steeped for 10-15min and taken before bed work like a charm,4,"If you are feeling backed up and need to get things moving, an 8oz cup of this tea taken before going to bed, steeped for a maximum of 15 minutes, will give you the expected results the following morning. One tea bag is enough to do the trick, and works every time, so follow the instructions properly and resist the temptation to use more than one. The taste may not be great but is not unpleasant and will grow on you with time. The tea loses a star because you may get some stomach cramps as it starts to work (some people reportedly don't), but then the tea will live up to its gentle name when you get your easy and painless bowel movement. As reported by other reviewers, steeping for less than 15 minutes may reduce the cramping. Some people have got it to work after seeping the tea bag for only 10 minutes so experiment and see what works best for you. I see that for some reason, when taken during the day, it is not as efficient and often doesn not work as expected. This tea alone works very well, but if you drink plenty of water throughout the day (even when you don't have the tea) and add more fiber to your diet, besides working like a charm it will even help you become more regular on your own. Take this tea if you are backed up and feel bloated, ou will feel reliefed and sleep much better after being cleansed by Smooth Move. It is a natural product but I recommend it for occasional use only as ingestion of senna over extended periods of time may be prejudicial. …",13 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",38 out of 40 users found this review helpful

I don't really cook much so i thought what the heck am i gonna do with all this powdered cheese??? So far i have added it to a steamfresh package of cauliflower with cheese sauce that i was disappointed to find had virtually no cheese flavor at all. Thankfully this stuff cheesed it up up up and saved the day (i was quite happy to have my random powdered cheese package laying around that day.) Another time i was having major cheese cravings, I added it to an Annie's microwave mac n cheese packet and i was in heaven. Oh and i also slapped some on top of microwave popcorn, which was quite tasty as well. SOOOO.....I'm glad i bought this stuff by mistake.

" Off-color, Irreverent  Hilarity",5,"I love this film. Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free. When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them. The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone. They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached. Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them. But Beetlejuice has his own agenda. The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable. Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well. The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia. One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh. What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it. The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy. I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence. Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann …",77 out of 85 users found this review helpful

 Quality control needed ASAP!,1,"Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control. I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each. In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in. Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them. Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.

 Not as good as it could be (misleading ingredient label also),1,"A number of us earnestly tried this product but after trying another brand, found this to be wanting very much.

Except this company, every jerky company; except tasty eats which uses no garlic or onion powder in any of their product line, all would list garlic or onion if an ingredient. The primal strips company has ""vegetarian spices"" so one is not clear what this is. Even the company, after phoning them, are rather reticent about saying if their is granulated garlic or onion.

Samson LOVES this stuff too, with the Iams I had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food/tablefood, but with the Canidae, he eagerly wolfs it down by itself. And why not? The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less ""filler"", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a ""super-premium"" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan.

 deadly,1,"1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous and Deadly, May 25, 2006 I have two beagles who love to chew, and greenies are highly compressed which woule make it a good optionfor my dogs. However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any. It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse. If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a ""busy ball"". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy **** let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety. If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie. Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly. While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies. I am actually surprised Superstore even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to Superstore users to petition them to stop selling it. …",1 out of 32 users found this review helpful
" Great product!  From corn, not birch",5,"If you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index, you will see that Erythritol is one of the best. It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol. But unlike Xylitol, it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating, gaseous effects. If you don't need a sweetener without blood sugar effects, you can look at brown rice syrup or agave, since they have a very low effect on blood sugar. If you want no blood sugar effects at all, I'd recommend this, since it has a very nice taste (like sugar) with no aftertaste. Stevia is another option, but is very strong and has a less appealing taste. If you use even a bit too much, Stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste. This is not true of Erythritol. I would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only 70% as sweet as sugar. You can spike it with Stevia to make up the difference if you like Stevia. It doesn't take much to add to get it a lot sweeter. You should shake it up really well before using, though. Note: If you want to buy this particular item, I discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address. I would avoid EmeraldForest, though, because the Erythritol I got from them had a very strange, foul smell -- like mothballs -- and had a faint aftertaste that was the same. Their customer service was very nasty when I called to return it. I am sticking with Now Foods from now on. …",49 out of 49 users found this review helpful
 Ekobrew Washer Hack,4,"When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good. I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer. If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past. The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer. The washer I used is rubber, 1/16"" thick, 5/32"" inside diameter, and 3/8"" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493. …",232 out of 235 users found this review helpful
