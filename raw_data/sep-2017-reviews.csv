 Fun Nostalgia,4,"I bought this as a gift for my husband's 28th birthday. When he was a kid, his mother never let him eat candy. Needless to say he is a complete sugar fiend, and would eat candy for breakfast, lunch and dinner if I let him! When he opened the box, he exclaimed, ""This is a really cool gift!"" and immediately tore into the box. It generated a great conversation about what candy we remembered. Some of the candy appears to be knock-offs of the ones everyone remembers (where are the Pop Rocks??), and some of the candy we had never heard of. Oh, and he opened the box upside down so he didn't see the ""Don't Open Unless You're A Child of The Eighties!"" until he closed it. All in all a very nice gift. He's away on business now and hid the box from me so I can't eat any while he's gone! …",21 out of 31 users found this review helpful
 jttodd,5,"Makes a great cup of sugar free-fat free 25 calorie hot cocoa! It's not quite as ""rich"" a product as some of the gourmet cocoas, but for those of us on restricted diets, it's a really good product. I like the canister because it's convenient and pretty much spill proof. I took the little single serving packets on vacation and they just don't travel as well as the canister.

 Great for drawing on candy melts!,5,"After attempting to use Wilton food writers on candy melts (successfully, but difficult and very spotty), these AmeriColor food writers are a dream! They're so smooth, and make perfect, crisp lines. Plus, the tips are very flexible, so lines can be thin or thick, depending on the amount of pressure applied. I use them for candy chocolate-covered cake pops, and plan on keeping a supply of these markers on hand at all times! …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 LOVE IT~LOVE IT~LOVE IT!!!,5,"I have been using Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil since December. I used to buy it at the heatlh food store by my home, however after receiving the great deal on Superstore I will continue to buy it here. Since I have been using Nutiva Coconut Oil my skin is glowing and I feel better all over. I use it as a daily moisturizer on my skin after my showers and I drink 2 tablespoons daily. I have a very hardy, healthy appetite and eat alot. For the amount of food I eat I should weigh more than I do. I believe that the Coconut Oil helps you maintain a healthy weight. I am so glad I found out about Coconut Oil and I will continue to use it forever. Thank you. …",9 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 No perfumed sissy teas for me ;-),5,"I have been a tea drinker since I was a baby. In fact, I cannot remember a day of my life without at least one hot cup of tea... And so, it is no wander that I am continuously on a quest for a better tasting leaf. As of lately, my choice has been the Black Pearl. Its fairly recent appearance on supermaket shelves has saved me from frequent trips to a not-so-local tea boutique. The Black Prearl is en excellent choice for those who, like myself, enjoy the brew without the addition of taste masking ingredients, such as lemon, sugar, or milk. The leaves are large (tea dust in the bag is an indicatour of inferiour quality). They brew a liquid that is golden in color (make sure your tea cup is white to enable you to admire it), strong but sweet in taste (unlike most Lipton brands that brew too dark and bitter for my liking), and an aroma that is true to the taste (be patient and allow it to develop; too short a brew=no aroma; too long=bitter taste). The Black Pearl presentation, a fabric piramid, is an added bonus, especially if you are brewing directly in a cup, or a transparent tea pot. My suggestion is to always use a tea pot as it lengthens the experience and allows for a better water to leaf ratio manipulation (quick tip regarding water: OVERboiling removes oxygen and prevents the maximization of flavour!). Sip and enjoy! PS: The price I have paid for this product on Superstore thru Subscribe and Save is HALF of what the supermarket charges! Go, Superstore! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Very cheap & No taste-*UPDATED REVIEW*,3,"Just received my first shipment and I must say this is awful. I am a heavy coffee drinker so I know coffee. This tastes just like the cheap stuff you buy at dollar tree in the bags. It is the least expensive kind of arabaca coffee that has no taste, not much odor and what it has is not that pleasant. I can definately see how they sell it so inexpensively. Please do not waste your money and getting stuck with the whole shipment. I have tried 3 cups and went from the regular setting all the way down to the least and it has barely gotten any stronger and the taste did not improve at all.. =================================================================================================================================== ***THIS IS AN UPDATE TO THIS EARLIER REVIEW 4-27-12*** First let me say that this company and ""Ruth"" in customer service have been great people to deal with. Ruth has sent me a few cups of every flavor to try in hopes I would like one. I am a Coffee people Donut shop lover and the green mountain brews are also my faves and I am a heavy coffee drinker having tried every method and brew out there. I am in my late fifties so alot of coffees have passed these lips over the years. None of the brews are gourmet coffees and most of them I would not buy again. I do find the fuhgeddaboutit and the boardwalk blend the most appealing. These are in order the most comparable to donut. The other brews, Brooklyn Bridge, Breakfast Blend and Corner donut shop are drinkable but alot weaker and bland tasting with no aroma. I probably will not buy these in the future. The other brews I did not like at all. **TO the issue of Cups Exploding I only had one cup out of all I tried that left alot of grounds in my cup and that was the French Roast. (I never like french roast in any coffee anyway)I investigated as to why this happened taking the top foil off the cup rinsed out the grounds and discovered the problem. These kcups have a seperate inner filter which comes out, attached to a plastic ring. This filter is thinner and cheaper made than the regular keurig cups. Apparently when the water hit the grounds it blew a hole out in the side of the filter thus the grounds leaked out the bottom hole into my cup. This cup also had grounds stuck around the edge into the glue used to seal the cup thus it could not seal properly, even tho it appeared to seal OK. I suggest whoever this company is purchasing thier filter inserts from needs to use a thicker paper and that should solve the grounds problem. Then making sure the rim is cleaned of grounds will solve the sealing problem. As to lids being crooked Thier equipment just needs a little adjusting and that should be solved. These people have really tried and I give them top marks for thier efforts. No I dont work for the Co and don't know anyone there. I am in TN and they are in NY so there is NO connection. This is an honest heartfelt review from a regular consumer. …",8 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Not the real thing,1,"Folks, I ordered this based on reviews I had read here. I wish that Superstore would at least provide the information on the label so a consumer can make a educated choice. First and foremost, this is not real balsamic vinegar. It is Wine Vinegar & cooked grape must, with a acidity of 6%. True Balsamic Vinegar ingredients is: ""is made from the Trebbiano grape. The rich brown color comes from being aged in wood casks, often for decades. Although it is made from grapes, balsamic vinegar isn't produced from wine (as are most vinegars). The authentic product may not contain any wine vinegars - the grape juice is simply reduced and then made directly into vinegar."" and will have acidity of 4%. I made the mistake of opening my bottle and will see if Superstore will take it back. …",29 out of 33 users found this review helpful

" A great product, but it is DEADLY to dogs and people need to be careful with it!!!",5,"I personally love Xylitol - I have no digestive ill effects from it at all, though I do from many other sugar alcohols. I think a lot of that depends on your own personal body chemistry, so if you need a sugar replacement you should try a lot of small amounts of the different sugar alcohols. For me, maltitol and sorbitol are awful, but xylitol is just fine. Of all the sugar replacements I have tried, I think xylitol tastes the most like sugar. It has a nice, grainy texture like sugar does, which makes it appealing for applications like sprinkling it on fruit, and it isn't overly-sweet the way I find most sugar replacements are. If anything, I would say measure for measure it is slightly less sweet than sugar, which I actually like as I'm trying to reduce my sweet tooth in general. HOWEVER, EVERYONE WHO OWNS A DOG NEEDS TO BE AWARE THAT XYLITOL IS DEADLY TO DOGS. I am not some weirdo posting rumors - please google xylitol dogs and the very first entry is from Snopes stating that this is true. As little as 3 grams can kill a 65 pound dog. I still use XyloSweet all the time; I am just very, very careful when I use it when my dog is around because he's a floor-licking sort of guy. And while I never give him people-food, I know others often do and you obviously can't do that with anything you've made with Xylitol. Please, please upvote this review if you can - I'm concerned that no warning appears on the bag or in the company's copy and that none of the highly-voted reviews discuss this issue. It is very easy to prevent what could be a deadly accident for your dog! …",74 out of 75 users found this review helpful

 Great Popcorn!!!,5,"I am a popcorn fiend! I love popcorn very much, and wanted to try some new types. Last year, my wife got me a gourmet popper, and I have been experimenting with different kinds. I got a couple of specialty popcorn from Williams-Sonoma. They were great, but on the expensive side. Now, this popped up a bit on the small side. If you are expecting big pops like from Orville Reddenbacher, you will be disappointed. What will thrill you, though, is the flavor.

 Sea vegetable,1,"Wakame is a pleasant, mild, slightly salty, tasting sea vegetable. It helps to maintain an alkaline balance in the body, and is an excellent source of iodine. However, when I ordered the Emerald Cove brand of wakame, I wasn't aware that their product is imported from China.

 The best of the energy chews!,5,"I'm a runner doing 30-50 miles a week and am currently (9/10) training for the Chicago Marathon. I've tried all of the gels and chews that are out there and these are my favorite. I don't like gels as that squirt of mush activates my gag reflex. Plus you always need water with them. I've tried all of the other brands of energy chews (I think); Sharkies (good but sticky and not very tasty), Clif Shot Bloks (nice package, very sticky on the fingers), GU Chomps (super sticky and caused some nausea), PowerBar Gel Blasts (very good but tough to chew if cold). The Honey Stinger chews are very easy to chew and you don't need water. They don't stick to your teeth either. The main selling point for me is that they taste good and don't cause nausea no matter what. I'm sticking with these ones. …",24 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 Great alternative to coffee!,5,"I love having a cup of Dandelion Root Tea to start my day. I have fibroid and needed to give up my coffee habit.

I can't really explain it -- while I loved it initially I guess I just got tired of it quickly -- I'd give it about 3 stars now. It's not bad, just -- nothing special.

 Good for a quick Indian fix,4,"Before I review, I will reveal that I am Indian. I grew up eating authentic, fresh Indian food, and now I cook authentic, fresh Indian food. NONE of the pre-packaged foods will come even CLOSE to freshly prepared food with freshly ground spices. It is impossible for a finely tuned Indian palate to relish pre-packed, factory-processed, preserved offerings. However, if you are not conditioned like me, then this is a great alternative to the restaurant fare we get in the US. Easy to use, quick and tasty enough.

If they're not safe, they should be pulled off of the market. There's a lot of Google chatter about this product being toxic (just look up ""Kingdom Pets Chicken Jerky""). It looks to me like only one or a few dogs got sick, and those one or few incidents are being cited over and over on different sites, making it seem like there's an epidemic. If only a few got sick, it might be from an unknown something else that just happened about the same time.

 These are good,5,"Energy Gel, Chocolate Outrage - 24 Packets This is a good product to use when you are training for a half marathon or a full one, and also during the race itself.

It makes recovery faster and I find my legs feel a whole lot better if I take it. I also like that the caffeine in it is not that much. I can't even tolerate a small cup of coffee, but the amount of caffeine in GU is just enough to give me a little fast energy while running, without giving me a ""caffeine rush"". The chocolate outrage tastes pretty good too. It can be messy too, so be warned and have somewhere to put the empty packets (because you wont want to carry them in your hand).

 Require some extra effort...,3,"I am originally from Belarus and I used to cook tons of buckwheat in my live. That buckwheat is something different from my idea of regular buckwheat. The grains are smaller, lighter in color, not toasted enough and when done it has bland scent not the full body aroma I remember. It cooks 2 times faster than original one-about 12 min., rather than 25min. and you need extra care if you want it flaky rather than sticky. Here is some advices if you want have it close to my idea of original buckwheat: 1. Toast it in the pan or skillet with some butter over the medium heat for 2-3 min.(better to use a shallow pan than a deep one) 2. Add salt, boiling water (2.2-2.5 parts of water to 1 part of gloats) 3.

 Something I Look Forward to After Each Workout,5,"I'm writing this review as I sip the Yogi Green Tea Muscle Recovery tea. It has a subtle honey flavor throughout and I also taste the lemongrass flavor especially in the beginning (you would smell the nice lemon scent as well). I taste green tea flavor also but its flavor becomes more definite during the aftertaste. If you like herbal teas, I think you would like this tea as well. Like other Yogi tea, I like that the tea never gets bitter even if I brew it longer than I suppose to (3 minutes). One tea bags make at least two cups of tea. As far as muscle recovery effects goes, I ""think"" I'm feeling a difference. I have been working out 5 times a week, and when I drink Yogi Green Tea Muscle Recovery tea, I do not have prolonging muscle aches longer than a day. However, I have to point out that it might be because I am getting used to my work out routine and need to push myself a little further to start feeling the ""pain"" again :-P Anyhow, this is okay as I'm not expecting a complete muscle recovery from a one herbal tea bag. What I like most about this tea so far is that its gentle scent and flavor definitely helps me to relax after each workout. I like to think and visualize that my muscle are growing as I sip this tea and it's a plus psychologically :-) I initially found this tea at local Whole Foods market. Purchasing this tea (pack of 6) from Superstore is cheaper than buying it individually from Whole Foods, and probably many other natural food stores. I hope Superstore will start having the Subscribe & Save option for this product like other Yogi teas. [UPDATE: Oct 12, 2011] Superstore now offers Subscribe & Save option! :-) I extracted description/effects of the top 3 ingredients (Green Tea Leaf, Lemongrass, and Blackberry Leaf) that contains the most in each tea bag as well as some other ingredients that Yogi Tea claims to play an important role in this product. Green Tea Leaf: - contains the most antioxidant polyphenols, which are responsible for its many health benefits. - is a more potent antioxidant than broccoli, carrots, spinach or strawberries. - enhances immunity and benefit oral health. - balance total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, as well as triglycerides, and to support a healthy ratio of LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol. Lemongrass: - supports mucous membrane function, and it is used to promote sweating. - is a warming herb that speeds digestion and reduces gas and nausea. Blackberry Leaf: - its vitamin C and tannins in the leaves helps boost immunity and heal wounds. - contains ellagic acid, which is a powerful cell protector and antioxidant. - is a source of mild astringent compounds (tannins), which tighten up and dry out loose, soggy tissue (so blackberry leaf has been used traditionally to ease minor sore throat, diarrhea and skin rashes). Devil's Claw Root Extract: - Native to southern Africa - is a shrub that has lush foliage and red flowers (The plant gets its name from its fruits, which look like a hooked, gnarled claw). - Historically, African people have employed the root for a wide range of conditions; from digestive function to joint support. - Since its introduction to Europe in the early 1900s, the use of devil's claw root has spread throughout the world, and continues to be used primarily for joint support. Yucca Root-Herbs: - A desert plant that grows in the Southwestern part of the United States and in Mexico. - is a Native American remedy used to soothe irritation of all sorts, and to support healthy joints and skin. - The main nutritional agents are saponins, which have a soapy consistency. Native Americans used yucca as soap due to its lathering effect and also as a blood cleanser. Ginseng-Eleuthero Extract: - is not a true ginseng, but a cousin of Asian ginseng. - has gained that nickname due to the fact that Siberian natives use it as a broad spectrum health enhancer, much the way ginseng is used. - has a long-term stamina enhancing effect. INGREDIENTS (as it appears on the product package): Organic Green Tea Leaf, Organic Lemongrass, Organic Blackberry Leaf, Natural Lotus Flower Flavor, Rose Petal, Organic Skullcap Leaf, Organic Lemon Myrtle, Organic Turmeric Root, Yucca Root Extract, Ginseng-Eleuthero Extract (Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolium, Eleutherococcus senticosu), Stevia Leaf, Cat's Claw Bark Extract (Uncaria tomentosa, Phenols 15%, Alkaloids 3%), Devil's Claw Root Extract. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION: Stay active with a cup of Green Tea Muscle Recovery(tm). Our satisfying blend starts with gently stimulating and antioxidant-rich organic green tea and combines it with traditional soothing herbs such as organic turmeric root, one of the most widely used herbs in India. We then add devil's claw root and yucca root--herbs from indigenous herbal traditions--to help decrease recovery time from the minor aches and pains that may result from exercise. What's more, ginseng-eleuthero extract helps you reenergize.* So get invigorated, be energized, and stay active with Green Tea Muscle Recovery!

 great smooth clean matcha tea but what will the Superstore price be?,4,"This morning I reviewed 2 ORGANIC matcha teas, side by side: 1. The first one was: ""2nd harvest Organic Domatcha"" tea that I purchased at a local farmer's market, and I paid $37.99 for this 2.82 oz tin.

It won in that review as well. I made the 2 cups identically, using soymilk and water 50/50, using the Blaney method (described below): ""Blaney"" Method for making Green Tea Latte: You need 2 small sauce pans on a gas stovetop, latte foamer device, bamboo whisk, soymilk, water, teaspoon measure, ½ cup measuare, and matcha powder. (many prefer sweetener and I suggest Agave syrup but I did not use it in this test since I enjoy the pure unsweetened tea flavor. Cheaper teas may require the sweetener to mask any fishy tastes, but not these two high quality brands.) 1. Using the latte foamer device, please foam 1/2 cup (cold or tepid) soymilk, then heat it gently while stirring (this personal ""Blaney"" method of mine makes the best foam) 2. heat 1/2 cup water (in separate pan) til boiling 3. add 1 level tsp matcha to 1/2 c. heated water and wisk with bamboo wisk about 30 seconds in zig zag motion until matcha powder is dissolved 4. add the heated, foamed soymilk to the matcha/water blend 5. pour this mix into latte device, pump 20 or so times, then pour entire foamed mixture into large mug. For this test I made the two teas simultaneously so the `foamed' structure would be nearly identical (one is supposed to drink the latte immediately before the foam dissipates). I did, however, rinse the items with filtered water before pumping the second tea, so as to not to contaminate #2 with #1. For photo of the 2 teas and boxes, see: [...] Result: >>>Taste and texture: DoMatcha won for a (very slightly, barely noticeable) cleaner taste, and better 'foam'. However, the SerendipiTea was still very yummy. I have the most sensitive taste buds on earth (other than my son) and I detected a very mild ""ocean"" taste with the Serindipitea, but I attribute that to the fact that my SerindipiTea had been opened a week prior. The DoMatcha had only been opened the day before. Newly opened teas always taste best. I would love to repeat this test in the future with two newly opened teas so that oxygen exposure won't be a variable as it was here. &lt;&lt;&lt;Price: Well, the DoMatcha 2nd harvest organic costs 4 times more, and is only ever-so-slightly better, and if I re-test with two new, unopened packages, who knows? Maybe they will be the same. I am giving the SerendipiTea organic 5 stars for being such a cost bargain, being organic, and tasting so great... and I am giving the DoMatcha 4.5 stars for also being organic and tasting great, even fantastic, but being such a high cost.

I assume that the larger and smaller ones are fine, but my pug who weighs about 16 lbs (within the 11-25 lb suggestion) could not swallow the chew and got it stuck in her throat (after she chewed it until the point when it got wet and pliable). Thank god that my wife and I were in the living room to witness the accident. My dog fell over in convulsions while choking and my wife physically yanked the chew out of the dog's mouth.

 With Lavazza it's all about the blend,5,"Lavazza coffee is wonderful but the different blends are, well, different. I really like the Caffe Espresso because of the heavier slightly bitter/strong but also slightly chocolaty-sweet taste and the aroma. I use a Mocha/stovetop espresso pot so that makes a different kind of brew too. Caffe espresso is 100% Arabica beans as is Oro. I find the latter a bit rougher/stronger. Then, the wise folks at Lavazza start blending in Robusto beans and for those of you that like super smooth, less bitter you need to try these... Crema e Gusto is at the farthest end of the spectrum - 70% Robusto 30% Arabica and dark roasted (usually they make a medium roast I think), super creamy, nice as Americano or a straight, milder espresso, me I don't think it stands up as a cappuccino. Next in line is Crema e Aroma - 60% Robusto. I haven't had this in years. Middle ground? That's Rossa with its 30% Robusto and 70 Arabica...this might be my favorite as espresso. There's a few other blends but they are newer and I haven't tried them... Superstore should offer a taster pack! Happy espresso drinking! …",62 out of 63 users found this review helpful
 Very Weak Tea,2,"There is another brand of organic rooibos tea offered on Superstore (Choice brand) that I previously ordered. I gave that tea 5 stars. Numi also offers a good rooibos. I decided to give Davidson's a chance since it was so cheap. Now I understand why it's so cheap. It is extremely weak tea. 2 bags of Davidson's is still not equal to 1 bag of Choice. Maybe 3 or 4 bags is more like it. I actually ended up throwing out my most recent cup of Davidson's because I had left 2 old bags in there, along with 2 new bags (so 4 bags in total) thinking that maybe I could suck more tea out of the old bags (something I did quite often with the other brands). But the joke was on me because what the tea ended up tasting like was the bags themselves with just a hint of tea. I feel that drinking this brand of rooibos tea is more like drinking plain water with just the hint of tea flavor. I doubt I will drink the remaining 96 bags I have left but will instead use them for my tired eyes when I go to bed at night. …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

" Expiration dates - Seriously, ignore them.",5,"A lot of people have been posting about the near-expired dates on the coffee. First, I'd like to mention that this product is intentionally labeled to have a really short shelf-life, and not to ensure freshness. The funny thing about expiration dates is that for something like this, it honestly doesn't matter. I've gotten batches that are expired (for cheaper) and the taste is the same great amazing taste as it was when it was well within the ""Best Until"" range. Yes, I have taken two packs, one expired and one not expired, and they both are the same delicious taste. The reality is that expiration dates are a wonderful tool that make people throw perfectly fine food and go out and buy more. Especially with dairy products: If it's a few days over, most people will toss out cartons of perfectly good milk or eggs that could keep for another five weeks, which keeps people buying it more frequently. The fact is, if you would drink it without knowing the expiration date is past (it doesn't smell or look bad) then it's not only safe to eat, but a waste to toss. This isn't true for drugs, however. If your medicine says it's expired, it's expired. Also, condoms. Those do lose integrity over time. So, this is a product that intentionally has a very short shelf-life because it makes ridiculous people go, ""Oh, no, instead of getting it cheaper online and in bulk, I'll just buy a lot of more expensive smaller packs for more money."" Starbucks enjoys charging their consumers for their instant coffee like it's magical pixie dust, and the only way they can stop people from buying it from other cheaper sources is to give it a tiny shelf-life. Look at some of the other reviews, here. It's working! …",117 out of 144 users found this review helpful

If you like a strong cup of coffee, this one is for you. As the earlier poster stated, I didn't get much of the Kahula flavor that I was hoping for. Not sure if I'll even use up the cups due to the aroma that is created when brewing.

 Splenda - What a horrible idea,1,"This drink should get ZERO stars. My husband and I recently purchased the Tassimo Suprema machine. We mainly drink cappuccinos, but we were excited about some of the other drink options. To add variety to our selection, we tried the Twinings Chai Latte T discs. I was the first one to taste the chai latte. I looked at my husband immediately and remarked, ""It tastes like it has Splenda in it!"" We were both incredulous at first, but then he tasted it as well. It did taste like it had Splenda. I took the packaging out of the garbage and read the ingredients of the Twinings Chai Latte. To our very severe disappointment, the very last ingredient was sucralose. My husband and I detest Splenda - it has an awful aftertaste and it gives us headaches. We are extremely disappointed that Tassimo/Twinings decided to put Splenda in the Chai Latte recipe. We did not purchase our Tassimo system because we wanted low calorie drinks - and if the product contains Splenda IT SHOULD CLEARLY SAY SO ON THE PACKAGE. Furthermore, we are perplexed why, if this one product contains Splenda, there is no other Chai latte option. Why in the world would someone want to spoil the wonderful taste of Chai with a manufactured sugar substitute like Splenda? If customers ASK for a low calorie substitute, it should definitely be made available. But why make your only version ""low calorie?"" We cannot bring ourselves to finish the rest of the package that we purchased - it tastes so awful. We're very disappointed that the money we spent on the package of Chai Latte T discs was wasted. If we had seen on the packaging that it contained Splenda we would not have purchased it - we automatically assume that the sweetener is not artificial unless the label indicates otherwise - all customers do. Of course, if you don't mind the taste of Splenda then you might really enjoy this drink. Otherwise, spend your money on something else - and make sure you read the ingredients before you buy it! …",14 out of 16 users found this review helpful

The product descripton's suggestion of offering the assortment after dinner is good, especially with coffee. I find they are very nice to set out at parties or just for everyday guests, too. It's so nice to just have a taste as I run out the door. The best part is that none of these disappoint because they're all chocolate with no mystery fillings.

The hero and heroine drown together in a car accident, discover they are dead and back in their dearly beloved house. They can't leave because there are monsters outside. Their peace in interrupted by the new owners who decide to redo the place in a ridiculous gaudy style.

 The One and Only Worcestershire Sauce Used by My Family for Generations,5,"When I grew up in south Mississippi, we did not have all the seasonings I use now that I have become a Louisiana spice mouth. We simply had the basics -- salt, pepper, a little sugar, vanilla, nutmeg, lemon juice, garlic, ketchup, mustard, homemade pepper sauce, and Lea & Perrins®. For us bought sauce in a bottle was only Lea & Perrins®. Nothing else could be substituted. Less expensive brands never tasted quite right to us. We lovingly placed that bottle with its brown paper cover on the cabinet shelf. I suppose it would have been fine to remove the paper, but with reverence we kept our ""wooster"" covered. On the special occasions when we ate grilled steak, we thought there was only one steak sauce - Lea & Perrins®. I have no reason to promote this product. My comments are not in any way solicited. I simply want to tell you what tastes good. When I married at a young age, my mother-in-law, Mary, led me into a new adventure of cooking and tasting the wonderful flavors of food. She cooked the best okra and tomatoes in the world. Like my family, she could use only one brand of Worcestershire sauce. Mom's Okra And Tomatoes 2 medium onions Some olive oil 16 ounces frozen sliced okra 2 small cans or 1 large can tomatoes 2-3 teaspoons Lea & Perrins® Worchestershire sauce ¾ cup Heinz® ketchup 1 teaspoon sugar or equivalent amount of sugar substitute 2 teaspoons vinegar Seasoned salt Black pepper Crushed red pepper Chop the onions into big chunks. Saut&eacute; them in a little olive oil. If the tomatoes are whole, slice them. Add the tomatoes, okra, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, sugar, and vinegar to the onions and olive oil. Bring the mix to a boil and season to taste with seasoned salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. Don't add extra sugar, which would ruin the taste; do add extra ketchup if you need it. Simmer the mixture until the okra is cooked enough. It should be firm, not mushy. Check the seasoning and add more as needed, but don't get started eating it. You won't have enough to serve.

I pulled some of the early sprouts, put them in a pot on my lanai, and they are doing far better than the plants in the 150 dollar machine.

 Love at first bite!  Tongue-puckering tang and crunch!,5,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy. I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten. It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since. Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly. I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch. Isn't that poetic? As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C. My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches. I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch. Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course. My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them. That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids! For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far. It isn't easy, but ... Have I told you how much I love them?

 This WAS a great product,1,"I have been using the full line of Lipton's Green Tea to Go for a couple of years now, and just love it. Have also turned countless friends onto it as well. Love the benefits of green tea, being able to avoid soda...and that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda was the primary reason for chosing the Lipton line. But NOW all that has changed and Lipton has made the decision to switch to Aspartame...which doctors tell you to avoid if you experience headaches. Aspartame is not very good for us, folks...but it must be cheaper. (Google it and see what you find!) Lipton has fallen out of brand loyalty for me and it is a window into their practices that they would switch to a lesser, more controversial ingredient. I'm sure there is plenty of marketing spin they can site for this reason, but facts are facts.

 Product not as described,3,"Package arrived in time. I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery. The salt was more like rock salt - the crystals being slightly larger than what you find in kosher salt. I have to dilute it with water before I can consume it. If you sprinkle it on a salad or similar semi dry food, you will feel the crystals, which is an unpleasant experience because it feels like you have sand in your food. This salt is not like regular salt that dissolves easily with little moisture/liquid. The package it is in is also labeled ""finely ground"". I use it for cooking - where I have no problems with it.

 hemp is the new soy,5,"Pros: -claims to have all the essential amino acids -organic -no sweeteners (artificial or other) -easy to digest and hemp protein is supposedly more usable by the body than whey or soy - loads of fiber Cons: - Tastes like you are literally drinking mashed up seeds even when i use a blender and combine it with milk. So if you are like me you wont be drinking this for the 'taste' of it. Its not an awful taste, but i guess if youre used to the smoothness of soy protein then this one will take getting used to. - Only has 15g of protein per serving,,, and a serving size is 4 TABLESPOONS FULL!

 Cutter Bug-Free Concentrate is Effective on Mosquitoes,5,"I live in an area in Minnesota where mosquitoes are numerous and extremely bothersome. Since we have relatively short summers, I look forward to the summer season to enjoy the outdoors, but mosquitoes will literally ruin the summer season if not treated. In addition, mosquitoes carry West Nile Disease, and a dear friend several houses away contracted this disease while working in his yard. He was severely ill for months, and was lucky to survive. To protect my family, I decided to take my yard back from the blood-sucking, disease-carrying demoms. I first tried one of the mosquitoe magnet devices, Magnet MM4000 Defender Mosquito Trap ,but despite its great hype (and price!), it did not eliminated the biting tormentors. I then sprayed the yard with an application of Cutter Bug-Free Backyard. The results were stunning! For the first time in many summer seasons, the yard was virtually free of mosquitoes. I have been using this product ever since, and am quite satisfied with it. For me it works better than any other product I've tried. The best feature of this product is that it both kills and then repells mosquitoes and bugs. I have found that it lasts about 3 weeks maximum, and that is dependent on the weather. If it rains hard after applying the repellent, I know I will have to reapply the chemical to the yard. A light rain does not seem to affect the repellant quality. Although Cutter advertizes an 8-week mosquito-free period, this is entirely inaccurate; the product must be applied every 2-3 weeks for effective mosquito control The active ingredient is Permethrin. Permethrin is extremely toxic to fish and aquatic life, so if you have a backyard pond, avoid spraying this area. It is also highly toxic to cats, since they lick their fur and ingest the toxin. Cutter warns to keep all pets off the lawn until the application is completely dry. Spray the yard from the outside perimeter in. You don't want to get the chemical on your feet, as it will cause a tingling sensation (it is a neurotoxin and is classified as a ""likely"" carcinogen. There is also a link to Parkinson's disease). Wear heavy shoes or rubber boots when applying. Cutter instructions say to wet down the yard first, but I usually apply in the early AM when dew is still present. Avoid applying in windy conditions as you don't want this stuff blowing back on you. Cutter says to not apply more than 14 treatments per year. The product is applied by using a sprayer, like Ortho, SCOTTS ORTHO DIAL N SPRAY HOSE END, and setting the dial to 1/2 oz./gallon. Spray every single piece of greenery possible, as well as the sides of dwelling, window screens, etc. The wider the perimeter, the better the control of mosquitoes. While there are risks in using any chemical, I apply the chemical carefully per instructions and avoid getting any on my body. The danger of West Nile Disease is significant in this area, and I'd rather apply Cutter's Bug-Free Backyard than avoid going outside. konedog …",32 out of 33 users found this review helpful

 Buyer Beware,1,"Like the other 1-star buyer, this powder was shipped to me in a ULINE static shield bag which indicates that it is ""ROHS Compliant."" ROHS compliancy means that certain metals are banned from being used in packaging, but not necessarily lead!

Because of all of this I can not be sure this product is not adulterated, let alone organic. I will not purchase this product again from this seller and suggest that other buyers beware. The product itself may be fine, but why take a chance (especially if you are looking for what is supposed to be an 'organic' product free of contaminants)? UPDATE 4/12/12: I complained about the improper packaging and submitted photo evidence of the static shield bags to both the seller and Superstore. Originally the seller claimed the product was shipped in food-grade ULINE bags, but after I sent photo evidence to the contrary I heard nothing further from the seller.

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",33 out of 48 users found this review helpful
 Add body at little calorie cost,5,I see this ingredient on product labels everywhere so I thought I'd check it out. I always liked thick shakes growing up so I thought it might be a way to make a sensible shake or smoothie with the body of a more indulgent drink. Guess what - it's amazing! It does the job to the nth degree. With the addition of about half a teaspoon you can make a fat free shake that almost refuses to pour out of the blender. I wouldn't reccommend any more than half a teaspoon to start because you can always add more liquid. I did that and wound up with a full blender full of drink and it was still almost too thick to pour. It's also very popular in salad dressings because it adds body and cling. Home made ice cream is another natural. Try it and discover your own uses. …,16 out of 16 users found this review helpful

Salmon is supposed to be heart-healthy, and has far less, (if any), of the mercury found in albacore tuna. And....salmon tastes yummy....especially sockeye salmon, (that is in these cans) -- which is reputed to be THE best-tasting salmon of all! REDHEAD salmon, made by the PURE ALASKAN SALMON COMPANY, herein being reviewed, is very, very, Very, VERY tasty! The ingredients are simply ""Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon and Salt"". This is not the (much!) more expensive fileted canned salmon -- but the skin and bone content is kept to a minimum. (Skin and bones -- which are in themselves very healthy eating -- can easily become almost unrecognizable, upon simply combining the salmon with other ingredients and mixing.) Sodium content here is medium -- 270 miligrams per can. The sodium helps to keep the salmon fresh, (a natural preservative, if you will), but it can easily be washed away by taking the open can, and pressing the just-removed top in, whilst you run cold water over it.... Sockeye salmon is RED salmon, (hence the name, REDHEAD). Red salmon is slightly more fatty -- but much more tasty, (at least to me), than the pink variety of salmon. (The extra fat gives the redder colour). THIS brand of sockeye salmon, (REDHEAD) is amongst the tastiest sockeye salmon I have ever eaten! This salmon comes in a nice, golden coloured can, with NO SEAMS! Seams in cans containing any food have been known to leach toxic materials into that food -- but there is no worry of that here. I bought my REDHEAD salmon on 9th September, 2009 -- and the expiration date reads July, 2012 -- so this salmon will stay fresh for a LONG time! It also bears the ""OU"" symbol of the Orthodox Union -- meaning that this product meets the highest in kosher quality. As attested to by the enclosures, (company priorities for safe, organic products, and serious stewardship of the atmosphere and planet -- plus some yummy recipes), the PURE ALASKA SALMON CO., which makes REDHEAD and other salmon, is totally committed to not only fine products -- but to the survival of their customers, (and all other human beings!), who inhabit this planet! This is salmon caught in ALASKA. It is made by the Pure Alaskan Salmon Company, of Burlingham, WAshington, 98225. It is therefore a TOTALLY AMERICAN-MADE PRODUCT! For those who care about such things, (like me!), this is VERY important -- and can even make the salmon tastier! : ) All in all -- and for so many, many reasons -- a very good choice to make when preparing salmon dishes! Highly recommended! …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Perfect for a home theatre popper,5,"I love this popcorn, and with the subscription savings of 15% and free shipping that you get on subscription products, this stuff is a bargain. I used to use th 4oz kits with my Whirley Pop and it made delicious popcorn every time. I moved to the 8oz bags when my Matinee Movie 8oz popper arrived from Discount Tommy. The 8oz bags have nearly twice the yield of the 4 oz kits and are less than 4 dollars a case more (Thats only .16 more a kit for double the batch) My 8oz popper creates a little more old maids because the kettle is designed to spit out the corn on the bottom of the tray as it pops. The 8oz kit is a bit big for home use unless you actually have a commercial style popper. There are very few oil based poppers (electric or stove) that can handle the yield of these kits, and if you have a Whirly Pop or Stir Crazy then I would get the 4oz kits. If you have a commercial style 8oz popper I would totally recommend these. The funny thing is that the 4oz kits have instructions for hot air machines. They say just don't use the oil. Are you kidding me!?!? It's the coconut oil and the butter salt that give this stuff it's ""movie theatre"" taste. Buying this stuff for a hot air machine is just plain dumb.

 Superb operation,4,"I received this as a gift at Christmas and have been enjoying using it. Its very convenient and keeps all the cleanup contained in one bowl. Best feature - the food processor is _very_ powerful and I don't need to strain foods b/c there are no chunks (I do strain peas to remove shells after processing). The steamer is quick and efficient. With the steamer basket full, I make about one-week worth of single-ingredient food at a time. I peel foods and cut into chunks before I steam them. Holds about 2 small sweet potatoes or two pears or one bag of frozen peas. I store foods frozen in silicone mini-muffin pans (much easier to remove than from an ice-cube tray). This device can be used to defrost food - just pop the frozen food in a small heat-proof bowl first. But, unless you keep a close eye and check a few times, the food gets way too hot. Easier to use the microwave for 30 seconds, then stir well to make sure there are no hot or cold spots. I will definitely use this when our baby starts to eat our food and it needs to be blenderized first. The blade and motor on the food processor are fabulous and better than others we have. Cons: - The price is way too expensive. I received it as a gift, but would not have bought it for myself. - The spatula is useless, a small silicone spatula is much better. …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful
