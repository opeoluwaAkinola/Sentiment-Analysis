 Perfect Dog Food,5,"My Pomeranian has a very sensitive digestive system and I could never find a food that I knew would provide him both great nutrition, taste and no allergic reaction. Until this canned food ----- that is. He loves it and it is made so well. You can tell there are no fillers in it by the appearance and texture. In fact, when you read the ingredients there is only Turkey Brown Rice and Vitamins. I encourage anyone who is thinking about ordering this food to give it a try. Your pooch will be glad you did. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Nice size for 'bottles',4,"I used to purchase liquor-filled chocolate bottles for X-mas for quite a few years. They were excellent and hoped to get them THIS year. The product web site was being upgraded so I had to 'settle' for these. What a nice surprise to find that they truly were NOT 'second best' These 'bottles' were much larger than the ones I used to get, hence, more liquor filling. I'm not that familiar with all the true tastes of the different 'spirits' but I felt they were all very good. I'd recommend these to anyone. …",19 out of 19 users found this review helpful

 K-Kaps a great inexpensive little item,5,"I have been using these caps constantly for the past 2 weeks and haven't experienced any problems with water leakage, poor fit, etc. The trick I found was to push the cap into the K-Cup so that the top rim of the Kap is even with the top rim of the K-Cup. I fill used K-Cups and Kap them days before I plan to use them and seal the hole in the top of the Kap and the hole in the bottom of the K-Cup with those ""dot-type"" stickers one can get in office supply stores and discount stores. This keeps the coffee/tea/hot chocolate, etc. from getting stale before brewing. To clean used K-Cups, I bought a cheap eyebrow brush to ""sweep"" the wet grounds out of the Cup and filter after use. I do keep numerous used, clean and dry K-Cups to fill and cap while recently used K-Cups are drying. I've found that the regular grind coffee that I buy in the grocery store works well for brewing as fine grind coffee tends to clog the needle in the brewer. To get the correct strength in tea, I fill the K-Cup with the equivalent of 2 teabags, then cap. For coffee, I fill the K-Cup to nearly the bottom edge of the K-Kap. So far my Kaps are working well and saving me money. Before discovering these, I was somewhat regretting having bought my Keurig brewer because of the high cost of the K-Cups and the number of people living in my house who drink multiple cups of coffee daily. The bill for buying K-Cups was starting to look like my mortgage payment! These saved my bank account. …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Get the original while it lasts,5,"After the popularity of the Slim Jim waned in the years following revelations that the alleged ""macho"" of its celebrity endorser was merely spray-on tan, we endured a series of tasteless and unsnappable tinkerings to the original recipe. Sadly, by the early days of this century, the original recipie had been lost. Even a team of scientists hired to reconstruct the glory of Slim Jims past failed in their efforts. We feared we would never see the likes of the ""skinny james"" of our youth. Happily, a warehouse cellar of the original was located near Hoboken, NJ. How the store had gone missing more than 30 years ago is not known. But, like fine wine, these Slim Jims have only improved with age. Get yours before they're gone! …",5 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Product change,1,"I also have been a fan of Cafe Francais since it came on the market. I so look forward to my coffee each morning. No more!!! The shipment I received last week came in a tin with a new look. My first thought was to check the ingredients against my old tin. Well guess what-----they changed a perfect formula. It has more sugar, less fat, more sodium, and a whole lot less coffee. It tastes more like creamer with very little coffee flavor. I sent an e-mail to General Foods International Coffees and am waiting for a reply. In the mean time I will not order it anymore unless they change the formula again. I am soooooo disappointed that General Foods would mess with perfection but not surprised. As I told General Foods in my e-mail, the Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans would be amused that they are passing off this new formula as Cafe Francais. …",21 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 You can call it dal or hummus & it's easy,5,"The biggest pain to making authentic hummus from dried chick peas is removing the chick peas' skins after they've been cooked, after hours of soaking the dried beans, prior to cooking. Bob's Red Mill Chana Dal Beans removes the real work. While not exactly garbanzos, Bob's chana dal split beans are a very close cousin. Soak a pound for a couple of hours, rinse, then cook until softened, and run them through the food processor with a little cooking water, tahini, lemon, garlic, cumin, salt, and a smidgeon of turmeric and pepper flakes. One pound dry will make about three pounds of delicious hummus. …",38 out of 39 users found this review helpful

 Based on beef being grass fed however . . .,5,"the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately I'm unable to review the flavor as I forgot I can't have beef anymore (due to health issues). Ingredients: beef, flavoring supplement (salt, dextrose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, spices, spice extractives, soybean oil), vinegar, brown sugar, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices Here is some info found on the internet: Maltodextrin ~ maltodextrin from corn or soy can be very unsafe/poison for anyone. As all GMO products like corn and soy are genetically engineered from the monsanto company. they insert a bacteria in all GMO products, and this changes the natural organic developing of corn or soy. do not buy anything that contains maltodextrin or titanium for your own health. Maltodextrin made in the US is made from corn. Corn in the US is a GMO food so Maltodextrin as derived from a Gmo is extremely unsafe. Soy ~ this particular info from: (...) . . .fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits. Fermented soy does not wreak havoc on your body like unfermented soy products do. Here is just a sampling of the health effects that have been linked to unfermented soy consumption: *Breast cancer *Brain damage *Infant abnormalities *Thyroid disorders *Kidney stones *Immune system impairment *Severe, potentially fatal food allergies *Impaired fertility *Danger during pregnancy and nursing and for all ~ Jesus Christ (Yahushua HaMashiach) is coming back. Don't leave this world without Him... Gift of God With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news. It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world. Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God. The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God. The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction. Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc. The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever? Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God. God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven? My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight! It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him! Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death. Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ! Yahushua loves you! …",3 out of 38 users found this review helpful
" Five Star Movie, No Star DVD",1,"This is a review of the 1997 DVD release- thus far, as of September 2006, the only release I know of. Of all of the DVDs in my collection this has to be one of the most disappointing. Without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant- the classic score, the hilarious comedy and Burton's twisted but brilliant vision- the quality of the film transfer to DVD is almost criminal. It probably wouldn't be noticed on television screens smaller than 27 inches, but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy, devoid of detail and utterly perplexing, given that the movie was shot in the late 80's. The first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape- the transfer is reminiscent of an old, battered 8mm film reel. I own a S-VHS vcr, and I have seen better film transfers on video tape. Additionally, the extras... well, what extras? There are several paragraphs of ""production notes"" which are basically brief overviews of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton, but nothing you couldn't gleam from Wikipedia in three minutes. All that aside, I did pay $9 for it at Sam's Club, so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever- but I expected so much more. If you're a Beetlejuice fan, wait for the inevitable Criterion Collection or Special Edition remaster. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 java podz,3,"We own the Senseo coffee maker and were using the Senseo coffee pods. I was so excited to find the Javapodz flavored coffee. However, they tell you that you only need to use one pod for an 8oz cup, unlike the Senseo coffee where you use 2 pods for an 8 oz cup. After drinking the Senseo, I found the Javapods to be a bit weaker coffee flavor, especially after I add half and half. My remedy to this was to use one Senseo mild pod and one flavored javapod and make a 12 oz cup, by using the 2 cup button and then directly after without changing pods I used the 1 cup button. This works wonderfully for me as I get the stronger coffee taste with the wonderful flavor that Javapodz offers. It makes a super iced coffee as well! The packaging is great. Each pod is foil wrapped so they stay fresh for a long time. …",17 out of 22 users found this review helpful
" I knew Log Cabin syrup, and you're no Log Cabin syrup.",1,"After acquiring the Log Cabin brand, Pinnacle Foods (which also owns Mrs Butterworths) reformulated Log Cabin. It no longer contains any maple syrup at all; now it contains artificial flavors instead. Some of those flavors (probably the artificial butter?) are really foul, and the syrup tastes positively horrible. (Logcabinsyrups says they now have a 100% pure maple syrup variety; that one might be OK, but I wouldn't touch the others with a 10-foot french toast stick.) …",9 out of 16 users found this review helpful
 Suprisingly good.,4,"Walden Farms salad dressings are a hit and miss. Some of them are a bit off, and some of them are really good, so I decided to try 'Asian' and was delighted. Wasn't sure what I was expecting, but the taste is very much like soy sauce with a slightly thicker consistency. I love to pour it over chicken or fish and then pop it in the oven. The only downsides have nothing to do with the quality/taste. 1, Sodium. This is to be expected with most salad dressings. If you eat it in moderation it shouldn't be an issue, but since it's zero calorie, some people think it's ok to pile it on. This isn't the case. 2, Price. The price tag might turn off the average consumer, but for me it's a trade off for the taste that I love and the zero calories/zero sugar advantages. If you're curious, and just want to try it out, I say go for it. If you're a dieter and are looking for a serious way to cut calories, I say DEFINITELY try it out. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Makes me feel good.,5,"Very tasty. If I am not feeling well, I have some quinoa and then I feel better. It is very gentle on my stomach and soothing. It is so full of vitamins and gluten-free. It is so natural. I eat it in a bowl with milk and sugar, or plain as a side-dish. I also add it to meatloaf instead of the bread crumbs. To rinse it-I line a collander (strainer) with a kitchen towel, measure 1 cup of quinoa into it, let water run over it until the collander is half full, and then swish my hand around the quinoa. I let the water drain out of the collander and then repeat the process two more times. After it has drained for the final time, I let the quinoa fall out of the towel into the pot I am going to cook it in. I brush the quinoa that doesn't come out with my hand. (I do all this in the sink so it doesn't get all over.) Then I add the water (for the recipe) to the pot, add a little butter and salt, let it boil, and then turn the heat down to low for 15 minutes-or until most of the water is gone.

 Not very hot.,2,I bought this to replace a large container of Schilling red pepper flakes that I bought about a long time ago. The old stuff served me well for cooking and pizza topping over the last decade. When I first tasted the new stuff I was a little disappointed that it was not as hot as the Schilling had been. It also seems to be losing its heat quickly -- there's less heat there than there was when I got it a few months ago. …,10 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Contains BPA!,1,"I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! It makes me sick that I fed them with BPA laden baby bottles before I knew better. We already have enough cancer in our family. I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder. I wrote to Muir Glen (now owned by General Mills) to see if they have any plans to remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. I would be happy to pay a bit more for jarred tomato products if they can't come up with BPA free cans. Or how about tomatoes in cartons or frozen? Please write to the companies that you buy canned tomatoes from and ask for BPA free products. Let me know if anyone finds BPA free tomato products, such as tomato paste, diced tomatoes, whole tomatoes...by responding to this comment--I will get an email. I have young children and I will not feed them anymore BPA!!! …",9 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 A major improvement in menopausal symptoms,5,"I tried this product after researching menopausal heart palpitations and internal tremors on www.power-surge . The relief was immediate! What surprised me was the improvement in many other aspects of my health. No more headaches that feel like a tight cap binding my scalp. Reduction of my migraines. No more nightmares (brought on by hormone fluctuations). No more ""internal earthquakes"" or buggy-crawling sensations on my skin. Less anxiety (formerly triggered by hormonal changes). No more weak nails. Monthly acid reflux greatly reduced, sometimes none at all. Greatly reduced frequency of colds, flus and sinusitus. I chose the Calm with Calcium since I am dairy allergic. My body assimilates it well, much better than calcium & magnesium pills, which had little to no effect on the above-mentioned problems (in ANY ratio). Overall, I feel much calmer & more energetic. Not a cure-all, but definitely has raised the quality of my life. I highly recommend this product! …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 WARNING - Cans buckling!,2,"I purchased and received a case of these 6 oz items mid-March-2008. I used two cans then and in reflection remember one of them spewing some paste when first pierced by the opener. Tonight I've gone to open another can and this time it really projected out the paste when pierced with the opener. So I decide to check over the others and find 4 of them really BULGING - each end pouched outwards a centimeter or so. And another 8 cans showing 1 to 3 mm bulges at each end! This case has been in an A/C-ed home in a dark closet. The case of small cans appears to come from 3 different lot numbers (OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1121, OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1122 AND OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1123) Note the 1121/1122/1123 code differs. With just my visual inspection it appears all affected cans are 1122 but I will not be eating any of the remainders.

" too easy, even for ""not-so-smart"" dogs",2,"i called up Kyjen customer service for a recommendation on a puzzle toy, and *bonus* got a iive person on the phone (brownie points for great service). I have a mini dachshund, who, although adorable, is not so bright and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item, my dachshund figured it out within minutes---i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly! Unfortunately, I wanted this toy to last for a while but this one unfortunately is too easy. See, If you spin the star just 20 degrees, *all* the treat trays are exposed, and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dogs playtime and challenge them further. However, my dog does love other Kyjen Toys -- the Tail Teaser, Egg Babies platypus and Hide-A-Squirrel in the junior size.

 My Dog loves it,5,"It seems like a really good dog food. One of the vets at the animal hospital that I work for recommended this. I used to feed my dogs Science Diet Sensitive Stomach (2 of 4 doctors at our hospital feed SD to their own dogs) but when employees were no longer given massive discounts on SD, I switched to this dog food since its about the same price as regular SD. science diet always seemed to make my beagle's poop mushy, although my other big dog does well with science diet and has firm poop. One of the other vets (who is more holistic) suggested this food to me since the ingredients are more natural and not from corn or meat by-products found in Science diet, and she preferred it over Science Diet ingredient and quality-wise. My beagle's poop is no longer mushy, and both my dogs are on this diet now and they seem to love it. **Keep in mind, every veterinarian is different and each vet has their own opinions about which food is best for dogs.

 Not too bad before I saw the mold,1,"I was so excited to get these because I thought it would be a great healthy snack to keep at my desk. I ordered these and other flavor (double chocolate chunk) and after eating a couple of each, noticed that one of the cookies had bluish green mold on it. I assumed it was a bad one in the batch. I saw on the manufacturer's website that these should be stored in the freezer since the shelf life is 90 days (due to natural ingredients and no preservatives). I immediately put them in the freezer after getting them 3 weeks earlier. The next 4 cookies I opened had that same mold on it and after I examine the rest, I found that they all were moldy. Apparently Superstore had them stored in their warehouse for a while before I rec'd them. Since there were no dates stamped on the cookies, I have no idea how long they sat in the warehouse before I got them.

 Healed a pesky area,5,"For 3.5 years i suffered from a vaginal ulcer and scarring from vulvar vestibulitis. I had had the surgery to remove the damaged tissue and ulcer because the damage was done and the pain was permanent so the scarred skin had to be removed. one week after the surgery the doctor noted that the area was not healing at all(probably half the reason i got that damned ulcer to begin with do to my bodies lack in ability to heal itself)so he wanted me to try putting manuka honey all over the stitches and skin down there, but not before expressing his concerns that some patients have reactions to the thoney and it didnt work for them. well two weeks later after using the honey twice aday, the doctor was shocked because I had healed so much. he said in the two weeks of using the honey, it did about three weeks of healing. Today I still use the honey all the time before and after intercouse with the hubby, so if any skin breaks it will heal pretty fast and prevent another ulcer or just help with the pain. There is no itching with the use with the honey and it is actually very soothing to use. Hate having to gross you all out with this review but I noticed there werent any reviews on how this honey helped heal the girl parts.

I then microwave this cup for 2 minutes (maybe another minute after i test it) then take it out to measure the temperature. you want to try to get the liquid around 160F degrees. (should be pretty hot to the touch) then i mix in the sugar to taste, then add the hot liquid to the cold, and mix it. it should all be clear after you mix them together, and then i leave it sit on the counter for a few minutes, then put it in the fridge. It takes a few hours to harden. when i first tried to make this, i thought it was like other jello, where you mix it in with hot liquids.. which is a bad idea.. since you'll wind up with a wad of glue stuck onto your spoon. Then after i tried to just mix it with cold water like the instructions said, but this never solidified. It turns out you have to mix with cold water, then apply hot water afterwards to activate it to harden. i hope this helps someone. …",27 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 Most tasty fast rice so far,4,"I so like the flavor and texture of this rice! The texture is remarkable. I think the big plus is that the rice was sprouted before cooking, witch also adds nutritive value over un-sprouted steamed rice. It is so tender but not mushy, with a rich nutty flavor. This takes about a minute to heat and is easily packed for meals away from home. The only reason I do not give it a full 5 stars is my sense of frugality. We all know how much less expensive it is to steam one's own rice. Paying $2.45 for about 15 cents worth of rice pushes my guilt buttons. That noted, for those who can afford it, or when it can be justified as a needed convenience, this is a terrific, whole, un-messed-with fast food. I currently justify the expense because easy access to wholesome food is of enough value to pay the balance. How much is good nutrition worth? Skip the fries and chips, zap a bowl of this. Maybe splash on some tamari and add some microwaved fresh mushrooms or zucchini, and you will be eating well and quickly, with minimum fuss. …",25 out of 26 users found this review helpful
 Best Coconut Milk - But Buy It Locally,4,"This is the best brand of coconut milk/cream I have found.

 NO MSG?,1,"Even I was fooled into buying this organic vegetable paste (made from seasoned, concentrated vegetables with no MSG!). Autolyzed yeast paste (the third ingredient) IS MSG. Also soy sauce (the fifth ingredient) contains MSG, also autolyzed yeast extract (the ninth ingredient) is MSG, and the seventh ingredient, natural flavor, can include MSG. Basically you think you are buying a healthy organic product with no MSG when in fact you are buying MSG (with a few healthy vegetables mixed in). It is criminal to be able to market this product as having no MSG. When is health going to take precedence over profit? Shame on us. …",13 out of 32 users found this review helpful
" good, HIGH sodium though",3,"I have no idea if this tastes like the real thing (I'm going to guess no), but it is very tasty. It's easy to make and is filling. Most instant noodles are either too bland or too spicey for me, but this has a perfectly seasoned broth. The noodles are firm without being too tough like some of the Annie Chun soup bowls. I really liked the huge pieces of green onion in it as well. Good product and my new favorite flavor. Huge downside? 1940mg of sodium per bowl, which is more sodium then you need in day never mind one meal. Ouch. The bowl has 2 servings and rounds out at 440 calories.

 Still not the Jasmine I had in China,2,"I have tried and reviewed a few Jasmine Teas and still have not found one current tea that has a jasmine fragrance. When I was in China I had a great tea that when you brewed it, would fill the air with the smell of Jamsine. You could smell it when you brought your nose to the cup. It was aromatherapy! I had seen people complain Rishi had too much jasmine smell so figured it was worth a shot. Teance, Chaa by Te and Whole Tea version of Jasmine Dragon Pearl Fujian, All have about the same taste and smell as the Rishi. No need to spend more on this tea. I would say Teance is the closer one as it is not as pungent. Sadly I do not smell any jasmine. I have a jasmine plant so know what this should smell like if true jasmine. Rishi Pearls I got do not have any jasmine smell. Not in the cup, not in the air. It is more pungent when smelling in the bag but I can not place the odor. My only thought, after speaking to Rishi, is that maybe I am smelling the type of tea plant and they suggested trying their white tea and jasmine. It is possible, since what I had overseas was a a loose tea, that I was not not drinking a silver tip tea. For the extra cost I did not get a better flavor. The other brands mentioned will give you the same results for a better cost per pound. …",11 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Love them... New Staple,5,"My wife and I are runners and all around athletes. I bought these after seeing Ryan Hall rave about them on his blog. Here are a few thoughts. They may seem expensive, but what I found is that they are so filling, we don't have to eat much. We make 3 servings per meal (I usually eat 2 and my wife 1). This is 1 cup which is about a 1/7 of the box. That meal ends up being about $0.75 for the two of us! Also, most pancakes usually have tons of calories, I can eat two servings, be comfortably full and only have eaten 260 calories. That's amazing! They are very quick to make. We have only made pancakes so far, but it only takes about 20 seconds of whisking. How easy is that? As for taste, I'm not AMAZED but they are good. They are boarder-line bland, so I put a little butter spray on them. We often mix them with fruit. However, for wholegrain... I'd say they are excellent. We've started mixing in protein powder and that has the potential to improve the taste depending on the protein you use.

 A fan,5,"Ok, this stuff is the cure for family visits lol. I only had this stuff a week or so before going home to visit my very large and loud family that although I love dearly, can drive me crazy when it's unheard of to stay in a hotel. I drank this in the evenings and it is like it melted everything away including the anxiety of staying with my mother and dealing with her obsession of cleaning with her new mini sweeper, going here and there to see this and that person, having to of course spend extra money that I normally don't, AND having my Weimaraner at my moms hearing her gripe about what his claws will do to her wood floor. I know, too much information but seriously....I generally crack and I held it together this time. I give some of the credit to this stuff. Its taste is pleasant and it is easy for an on the go status like what I was. I recommend this to anyone who has a lot on their plate, especially if it is temporary and you aren't used to dealing with it all on a regular basis. That kind of stress can lead to a meltdown! I usually get sick with a really bad cold or such within a week of being back in my own environment but this time I did not.

 Not pleased with cake/Took 19 days to arrive,1,"I ordered this and I got confirmation they sent my fruitcake to my PO Box via UPS. Which of course, can't be done!! My fruitcake arrived 19 days later. It was vacuum sealed. It was not moist. It was as heavy as a brick and very tiny like half a brick. Careful around small feet and pets. As I was trying it...I was also reading the ingredients on the back. Horrifying....They say ""fresh"" but the ingredients list says mono & diglycerides 2 times, artificial flavor 3 times (one is artificial butter), partially hydrogentated oil, many preservatives including Sulfur Dioxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Benzoate of Soda and also something called Gum Tragacanth. I always knew the candied fruit in fruit cake may not be naturally dried fruit, but I prefer that the rest of the cake is truly fresh. I tried this `cause it came in a small size and was less expensive, but normally I get the Assumption Abbey Trappist Monk (Missouri Ozarks) cake, which only comes in one size, but does also have 4 stars on Superstore reviews.

 If you knew how it was produced,1,"If you knew how foie gras was produced, you probably wouldn't buy it. Ducks are intensively raised from birth, their toes cut off so that their talons don't have to be maintained. They are manhandled so forcefully that many ducks break wings or legs or sometimes even necks. They are forced into individual cages and remain there, until they are forcefed fat through long metal tubes, to swell their livers. They are given so much food that they struggle to breathe. This happens 3 times a day. Sometimes, the ducks don't survive this maltreatment, and their bodies are thrown into wastebins. I am not a vegetarian but I believe that it is wrong to intensively raise animals in this way.

 My cat loves them and the seller was great,5,"I was worried that my cat would not like these and was hesitant to buy this many. I purchased a smaller bag and my cat LOVES them. So I purchased this much larger bag at Superstore's much better price via Superstore from Entirely Pets. Again, I was worried about the seller based on other comments. But they were ordered on Sunday, and I got them Tuesday morning - they ship from Fremont, CA. The expiration date on the bag is 16 months from now, about what I would get in any retail store. So I've just not experienced any problems with this seller or this product. The manufacturer admits that brushing your cat's teeth is much better, and I do that about every other day. This product ensures that there is at least something done for his teeth every day. And trust me, my cat does not let me forget to give him one of these every night. He'll claw at my legs until I do and his claws are sharp! By the way, one tip for cat owners: many of an older cat's problems are due to the propensity of most cats not to drink enough water: kidney and teeth problems are common. I feed my cat only a teaspoon of wet food a day, smothered in about 2 ounces of water. He drinks the wet-food-flavored water and only then gets to eat the wet food. My cat is 19 years old (the average cat lives to be about 12-14 years old) and has had no major health problems. However, the teeth cleanings are getting to be too stressful for him, so I've taken to these treats and brushing his teeth to try to spread out the cleanings. …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Coffee Alternative,4,"I recently decided to give up coffee, including decaf, for health reasons. I drank coffee all day long, sometimes making a second pot in the early afternoon. I enjoy drinking a warm beverage throughout the day and wanted to find something to replace coffee. I buy a lot of things from Superstore and decided to start my search there. I found a number of products to choose from, and after reading the reviews, I decided on these three: Cafix, Caf-Lib, and Dandy Blend. The first thing you must do when trying any coffee substitute is to set your expectations. The reviews I read said these products tasted like coffee. They do not taste like any coffee I have ever had. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you are expecting a coffee-like taste when you try one of these, you will be disappointed. That was my experience. I drank my coffee black, and so that is how I prepared these. Perhaps with sweetener and/or creamer these do taste more like coffee. I ordered all three products from Superstore , and the first to arrive was Cafix. Thinking it was like coffee, I used a level teaspoon just like I would with instant coffee. It tasted like really weak coffee. I tried adding more to make it stronger, but it still did not taste like coffee, and I was disappointed. I finished the drink and put my cup in the dishwasher. After I thought about it for a while, I realized what I really wanted was a beverage I could drink throughout the day like I did coffee. Whether or not it tasted like coffee was not important. It's not that Cafix tasted bad, it wasn't what I was expecting. So I made myself another cup, and when I finished that one I made a third. By the end of the day I decided that Cafix wasn't so bad after all, I actually enjoyed it. A couple days later I received Caf-Lib and eagerly fixed myself a cup. First impression was good. Caf-Lib tastes similar to Cafix to me, but has more flavor. Caf-Lib is also stronger, so I use less to achieve the same strength. After comparing Cafix and Caf-Lib I decided that I prefer Caf-Lib. The next day Dandy Blend arrived, and I fixed myself a cup right away. The directions say to use a slightly rounded teaspoon for a strong coffee like drink, so that's what I did. Dandy Blend was a little slower to dissolve, requiring that I stir it longer. Not important really, just observation. Finally I took my first sip. To my amazement I found the taste reminded me of Caf-Lib and Cafix. I think the reason is because none of them have the bitter taste of coffee. They are all very mild. Dandy Blend's has slightly more flavor Cafix, but not as much as Caf-Lib. #1: Caf-Lib The most flavorful of these three and my favorite. I used one rounded teaspoon per cup. Has somewhat of a nut flavor. #2: Dandy Blend I used a slightly rounded (almost level) teaspoon per cup. It has somewhat of a smokey smell while stirring. More flavor than Cafix, but not as much as Caf-Lib. #3: Cafix I used one heaping teaspoon of per coffee cup. The taste is very mild. There are many factors to consider when choosing a beverage. I prefer to drink them black, while you may prefer to use creamer and/or sweetener. Only you can determine which one would you prefer with your favorite snack. The reviews are good as a starting point, but I suggest you try all three to discover which one you will enjoy the most. …",30 out of 31 users found this review helpful

 Great popcorn at a great price,5,"As a lover of popcorn, over the course of my half century on this planet, I've pretty much run the gamut on the variety of ways to eat this delight -- over the stove, the air popper and then by nuking it. All were fads that faded over time. Then, through the greatness of Superstore, I found the Whirley popper, and ordered their popcorn to go along with it. It was great, albeit a bit expensive. Then I discovered Great Northern's Great American popcorn. Not only was the Great American popcorn cheaper in price, but by comparison, the six-ounce package I ordered was larger than the similarly-packaged Whirley Pop at 5.5 ounces. The taste was probably about the same, although psychologically it tasted better to me because of the better value. I probably went a little overboard, but thanks to the special 99-cent shipping at the time, I purchased three 24-count cases. Each of these packages produces a whole lotta popcorn, which if not eaten right away, is still really good a week to 10 days later. Just a great value for middle aged people who could use a little great-tasting ruffage in their systems! Gotta go; feel another batch coming on!!! …",11 out of 12 users found this review helpful

In my opinion, it is most suited to baking. I substitute coconut oil whenever the recipe calls for butter, vegetable oil (microwave the coconut oil to liquefy) or shortening. I've used it to bake cookies, muffins, bread, sweet dinner rolls, etc. Everything comes out moist and delicious, with no worry about trans fats. I definitely recommend this product. …",51 out of 52 users found this review helpful
 14 days so far! I've done a lot of online research.,5,"I am 34 year-old male who had terrible side effects (severe constipation) from statins while trying to reduce my cholesterol of 234. I had to quit taking them. A friend at work recommended 2 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar with some juice every day. She said her results shocked her doctor after 2 months. She also said it worked for her sister. So, I tried it that night, and also wanted to check it out online, because I'm always a skeptic. What I found was that a LOT of people recommend ACV for a whole range of things that interest me. After reading all I've read, and from my personal experience so far, I'm really diggin it. The only side effects I've seen is the taste, and because it is very acidic, people say you should keep it off your teeth as much as possible. Here's a list of some of the things I've read that it helps dramatically with: Cholesterol, blood pressure, immune system, detoxification, eczema, migraines, headaches & sinus headaches, hair thinning & hair loss, warts, slow steady weight loss, diabetes, depression, insomnia, increased energy & alertness, infections & cancers, the flu, sinus infections & post nasal drips, allergies & asthma, chronic fatigue, sore throats, arthritis, ulcers, bowel problems & IBS, nail fungus, acne, skin problems & complexion. The list goes on and on, to the point where it sounds WAY too good to be true. I read several testimonials from teachers and nurses that used to get sick repeatedly, to the point where they thought they'd have to quit their jobs, until they started taking ACV. They claim they don't get sick anymore at all. Since there really doesn't seem to be any side effects from ACV, I can't think of any reason NOT to try Apple Cider Vinegar. I am curious/anxious to see if it helps with some of my stuff. In particular, I get sick. A LOT. I work in retail and I usually need antibiotics at least 4 times each winter for sinus infections, sore throats and post nasal drips, going back to when I was a kid. Allergies. Cholesterol. More energy and some weight-loss sounds good too! Basically, it seems to clean out your blood and detoxify your body really well, which helps to get the whole machine running like it should. I've only been on it for 14 days as of this writing, and what I can testify about so far is: 1. Energy/Alertness. I feel really good so far. Many users claim they feel a very persistent boost of energy within a day, and I certainly felt it too, and it hasn't stopped. I've also been sleeping very well. For at least 10 years, (since about when I had mono) I have always felt like I was in a bit of a brain fog. (No jokes please!) Since taking it these past two weeks, I feel very alert with increased energy. It just FEELS like my body and brain are simply ""on their game"", so to speak. 2. Allergies. When I started taking the ACV, my allergies were already bothering me for a bit, and I've been clear as a bell since the first day. Also, every time I go to my in-laws, my allergies go nuts from their dog. I usually have to start popping Benadryl within a half an hour. This past week, I was there for 2 nights and 3 days and didn't even need 1 pill. My sinuses were totally clear! Was it the ACV? Other people said they had similar quick findings, but I don't want to say for sure. Ragweed season is right around the corner, so we'll see how it handles that. 3. Complexion. ACV supposedly helps clear it up in a slow but steady fashion. My face was breaking out really bad for the past month when my cholesterol pills screwed up my whole system. In addition, I have always had many blackheads on my nose area, no matter what I washed it with. I poured a little bit of ACV on some paper towel and rubbed the area with it like a Stridex Pad, and within 2 days my facial complexion looks better than it has in years. I've never gotten results like this! Again, is it the ACV? I can't say for sure. It could just be that my body is happy I've stopped doing what I HAD been doing. Watch... I'll probably wake up with a big 'ol zit tomorrow morning! In general, it just feels like I am being detoxed, and natural remedies like this are up my alley. If it helps with just 1 or 2 of these things, with no side effects like my pills gave me- I'll keep at it for a while. I don't want to go around running my mouth until I am positive it is seriously working, but I wouldn't mind hearing if it is working for other people too. So let me know if you try it and what you find, and I'll continue to do the same... I'm a bit of a closet scientist who loves to discuss his data! The only other things I take daily are a Men's One-a-Day vitamin, Activia (yogurt), Claritin (allergy pill), and a fish oil pill (also good for cholesterol & heart health). I've been taking 2 tablespoons of the ACV mixed with very little water, like a shot, and then I chase it with more water. The bad taste is over in less than 5 seconds- No sweat! One thing I've read over and over again, is to NOT buy the regular ACV you find in the store. People say that it has been distilled and filtered to make it look more clear- but that just takes out all the nutrients and potency. They say to look for ""organic"" or ""raw"" from a health store or farm stand, and it is just as cheap. They say that the cloudier it looks, the better. Just Google ""apple cider vinegar"" and you'll quickly find hundreds of user testimonials and advice from around the world, from all types of people. I was skeptical at first, but you have to ask yourself... ""Could ALL these people be morons?"" Or, ""Why would they all lie about a 3 dollar bottle that they aren't making any money from?"" There doesn't seem to be much to lose. If it stops working, I'll stop drinking! I'll write another review after my cholesterol check-up within 2 months, and probably another after I see how it does with colds this winter! Good health!! …",157 out of 162 users found this review helpful

 A Passion for Vanilla,5,"Superior vanilla beans come from the Madagascar ""Bourbon Islands,"" Mexico and Indonesia. I find the flavor was truly superior to normal vanilla extract. While you don't want to use vanilla beans in everything (too expensive!), you will definitely want to consider using them in custards and when you make ice cream. Vanilla enhances everything from creamy porridges to custards and cakes. The list goes on and on. There are so many uses for vanilla. Vanilla is derived from the seductively aromatic vanilla bean. Vanilla beans are actually the cigar-shaped seed pod from a fragrant climbing orchid native to tropical America. Yes, vanilla extract is much more economical, but using vanilla beans is rather gourmet. The extract is created from chopped vanilla beans that are soaked in an alcohol/water solution. It takes about 100 beans to make 1 gallon of extract. You can use the vanilla beans, rinse and dry them, so they last longer. After drying, you can store them again in the glass tube or in their own plastic bag for reuse. ~The Rebecca Review …",7 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Yep.  It's gum all right.,4,"I am a Trident Original gal. Have been since my youth. Oh sure, I strayed into Extra territory, and who can forget the ""Bubble Yum"" years? (Red Dye Number 2 anyone? I know, you are too young. Whatever.) I always returned to my Trident Original. It tastes good, the flavor lasts, it's the right size. But this is not Trident Original. This is fancy pants Trident Vitality ""Awaken."" Trident lets you know it's fancy by excessively packaging it. It's a lot of paper and plastic for 9 pieces of gum, so I dropped it a star for that. The gum is nicely flavored. I do like the texture aspect when biting into a crunchy outer coating, and getting into the soft center. The flavor lasts a long, long time. (I'm pretty sure that's another gum's motto - Hubba Bubba as it turns out.) I chewed for 45 minutes. At first it's a pretty soft chew, but the gum firms up as time goes on. By the time I was ready to spit it out, the flavor was still there but my jaw was sore. I'm sure there's a joke in there somewhere. It's a nice gum, but nothing I would throw over my Trident Original for, and the packaging would give me pause anyway. Though, I will say that one benefit of the packaging means that it is impossible for the gum to fall out of the pack and get purse debris stuck to it, so that's a nice feature, but heck ... what's a little sand and tobacco stuck to your gum? It gives it character. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

 Tender Chunks,5,"Here's the content for this product: Beef, Beef Broth, Salt, Modified Food Starch, and Sodium Phosphates. 12 ounces; recommended serving size: 2 ounces; servings per can: about 4 (that recommendation probably takes the presence of the liquid into account); calories: 80; calories from fat: 15. Total fat: 1.5g, 2%; Saturated fat: 0.5g, 3%; Cholesterol: 40 mg, 13%; Sodium: 180 mg, 8%; Total carbohydrate: 0; Sugars: 0; Protein: 15 g; Iron: 6%. Distributed by Costco Wholesale Corporation; 1-800-774-2678; [...] I pronounce this product good and low in salt. The only drawback might be the phosphate content, but if that doesn't kill me, something else most definitely will. I'm a skinny person, but whatever food providers claim to be a serving never works for me. The most I'll get out of this can is two servings; a larger person might have to eat the entire can's content, which contains a lot of broth. I had my serving with mashed potatoes and peas, and it was good after I doctored the meat with curry, onion, Tobasco sauce, sesame oil, and garlic. Although olive oil makes a lot of things taste delicious, my body behaves better when I feed it sesame seed oil. Next time, I'll try the beef in spaghetti sauce or tomato sauce with vegetable puree. However, I'm okay eating insipid stuff, so I could have easily eaten the meat as a sandwich with just lettuce and tomatoes. For people who can't eat anything without flavor, you will need to add whatever you prefer; think of it as plain beef because that's pretty much what it is, with plenty of beef broth that you can use as a stock for stew, gravy, or any other concoction. I used a portion of the broth over my potatoes; it made them smoother. The meat comes in stew-size cubes that were apparently pressure cooked to tenderness, since they flake apart with a fork - I like tender meat. The meat has almost zero fat; much of which was solid and stuck to the lid, so I guess my apartment is comfortably cold. The pack comes with three Mexican-style recipes, but you can definitely do your own style of cooking; a beef stroganoff would be nice. When I used to drive along the east coast and stay at the Days Inn, I always carried my own canned goods with me that I warmed up at the motel because a can of Health Valley soup, Del Monte vegetables, Progresso tuna fish, or Crown Prince salmon is always healthier than eating at one of those fast food chains. I suspect that eating this Kirkland roast beef is also healthier, despite the sodium phosphate. As the daughter of a cook, I can prepare fine fresh food, but I choose not to because I don't like kitchen duty. So, whenever I don't order take out, canned or frozen items and baked potato work fine for me. Conclusion: I recommend this product and will buy it again. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Off-taste,2,"Having used virgin CO for a few years now, decided to try a different brand from my regular, since this 3-pack was a good price (I try to pay under 50 cents per ounce). This product has a more prominent flavor than my regular (Nutiva). I enjoy coconut flavor, and so this wouldn't really be a problem except that it has a noticeable off-character. I tastes spoiled (though it's not). If you have children you may recall the scent of spit-up milk from an infant--that's the flavor. It's hard to palate! This is likely the result of the processing method. This may be a ""traditionally-processed"" (Philippine method) oil, in which the chopped coconut is allowed to ferment in order to separate the oil. Other cold-processing methods avoid this fermentation step and extract the oil mechanically. Both result in a minimally-processed, truly ""virgin"" product (as opposed to a refined oil which is further processed with heat and solvents to remove flavors and other natural components). Also this has a grittier texture than I'm accustomed to. Two stars for overall quality (and I'm just a big fan of coconut oil), but beware of the stronger and unpalatable smell and taste. …",14 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 Beware of these ingredients for your dogs,1,"I have studied canine nutrition for the last 5 years and one of the biggest negatives I see in many commercial dog food companies is putting profit over care. In looking at ingredients in treats and food, many companies are fabulous. However, sadly, some put the cheapest ingredients that often even cause negative reactions in dogs into their products and then add flavors to make the dog want them so they continue to be bought. Ah, but don't take my word for it. First ingredient in these? Rice Flour. Not meat. Not whole wheat flour. Not brown rice flour. Rice flour...bad carb, no protein, breaks down into sugar. But it gets better. Second main ingredient? SUGAR. Let me repeat that. This contains mostly sugar. Yes they are shaped like bones and you feel like you are getting some good protein in and that they aren't like giving your pet hard candy. Naw. That's marketing. They only contain 7% protein and the protein source is derived from ""dried meat by product"". In other words, meat waste. But lets go back to sugar. You could give your dog a tablespoon of sugar each day and they would crave that too. But you will also have to pay for extra tartar scrapings from your vet which are stressful to your canine companion or have a pet lose their teeth in their later years. But I'm just getting started. 3rd ingredient? Wheat flour. Not whole wheat flour...processed and stripped of it's nutriotional value. Cheaper. And of no nutritional value. Cheap. So you think the fourth ingredient must be some protein huh? Naw, it's Propylene Glycol. Then powdered cellulose Then sodium caseinate but we dont want our dogs to thumb their paws up at such ingredients so natural poultry FLAVOR is then added. This is what some dog companies do, besides adding sugar, to make a product marketable...have it TASTE to the dog like it has something they need or want in it but it just be a flavoring. Then they beg for it and owners think it's great, buy more, and profit is good. BAD. Now then, let me sum this up with the warning under the feeding guide: ""Up to (meaning no more than) 5 sticks every week"" and ""not suitable for puppies or dogs under 5 lbs."" Yet the jumbone mini with a yorkie on the front has these ingredients and then says not to give it to small dogs! That is called a legal disclaimer should your dog develop issues from the feeding of this product. What more needs to be said? Yeah, you don't have those warnings about nutritional harm when you just feed your dog some good natural treats or meat. Animal crackers or saltwater taffy would offer your dog the same taste and ingredients for the most part as these and be cheaper. I take it back. The above two wouldn't have as many artificial flavors and preservatives. Don't buy into the hype ""big meaty center"" If by ""meaty"" they mean 'sugar and cellulse"" then I agree... I so hate seeing profit over care for companion animals. Why did I give it 1 star? I had no choice, but afterall, If you have to go by will your dog like it? You bet! But they like chocolate too...doesn't mean they should eat it. I am not promoting any particular dog food or treat here...just giving my opinion (based on 5 years of study on the subject on my part) that you may wish to avoid sugar and cheap fillers for anything going into your pet. Animals are so little and dependant upon our choices for them. And, especially if you dont brush their teeth daily as most of us don't, giving them something filled with sugar and bad-carb flours is highly detrimental to thier livers, teeth, livers, kidneys, and full canine systems. Not to mention the artificial fillers and dried meat by products. Meat waste can have very bad things in it. It's not suitable for human consumption (these include the parts thrown away that may be diseased or tumerous. Yes, seriously, these ARE allowed to be used in dog food.) And don't even consider the vitamins added. When made into a processed dog food of this type, they get baked out at such high temperatures used in the processing. So consider that teeninsy bit added at the very end of the ingredient list null and void after processing. Buy em a real soup bone or give them carrots or NATURAL wet dog food or cottage cheese for a treat. Dogs don't do well on things like this and it can cost you more in their health than the savings on buying a less expensive brand. I love em (pets) too much not to review this honestly... …",10 out of 12 users found this review helpful

I find that I tend to order blindly from Superstore when I'm actually purchasing from Superstore and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.

 BPA in Lid & Food,1,"Like other customers, I was sorely disappointed to find out that there is indeed BPA-containing plastic in the lid of Earth's Best food products. I feel that this company is taking advantage of customers and deceiving mothers & fathers who are trying to do the best by buying organic food for their babies. The company will not answer questions directly online or on their FaceBook accounts. They give you the runaround to call their customer service number. However, when they do finally admit to BPA being in the lid of the products, they try to pass it off as being an ""industry standard"" and that the food is ""Safe."" Well, for those of us who are concerned enough to purchase organic foods--I think we want to see NO BPA in the packaging or product.

So, I have decided that, even though my baby has enjoyed Earth's Best products, I will find other products that do not have BPA in their packaging or food items. I am truly disappointed that this huge manufacturer of ""organic"" products is allowing a product that has been banned in baby bottles in Europe to be in the lids of food jars in the United States. Shame on them. I hope this helps other moms & dads out there to be aware of what is in this ""organic"" food product. …",23 out of 26 users found this review helpful
" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful
 I love Juice Plus,5,"I have taken Juice Plus for about 5 years now. Ever since I started taking it, I feel better, I look better and very rarely get sick. I had run out about 4 months ago and within those four months of not taking it, I got a cold twice. That's proof enough for me. I don't eat enough fresh fruit and vegetables (I wish I did) and Juice Plus is a great supplement. I have noticed though, that when I'm taking Juice Plus I actually crave the real thing more. That is another thing I like about it! AND...there are no strange ingredients! …",18 out of 21 users found this review helpful
 High Mountain Magic.  Food of the Gods.,5,"Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Superstore's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here. My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa. The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing. In that maiden purchase I also added lavender and clove essential oils to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, and lavender tea. See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here. I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment. If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts. Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories. I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, ""nutrition"" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of ""yummy.""). Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs. The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to ""gourmet it"" accordingly. -- As ""rice"" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc. Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa. Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with ""noodle heaven""; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course). -- As ""oatmeal"" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing. As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice: - Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio. 2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa. -- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes. -- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave. You can heat the water to boil in a bowl then add Quinoa, cover, and cook. Normally, a microwave cooks 4 times faster than ""outside-the-waves"" cooking, but, of course that time varies with larger amounts of food. For example, 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes. -- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (½) cup liquid. I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles. Then I cover the bowl with a plate ""lid""; zap it for another minute or half, then let it ""steep"" in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes. (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.) In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice. But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method. I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate ""lid"" I can just place it on the table for family style ""digging in."" I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa. Thankfully, so does my husband! In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when/if the products are available on Superstore). Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm very confident in ordering any item from them. And now Berry Farms has been added to my list of healthful, gourmet goods. Quinoa has an iteresting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain: -- The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment's, like worms or parasites. -- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects. -- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the ""naked"" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions. Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise-old-grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eons-younger food offerings. I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available. Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world. Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas). Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those. A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Superstore. I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything. For the sake of ""health""? Here's an interesting question to ponder: Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had ""lived"" long enough to develop saponin. Why and how did we find them again? For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz Linda Shelnutt Author of several books, including: Molasses Moon …",28 out of 38 users found this review helpful
 Titan Loves his ZiwiPeak Venison!,5,"This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain. More on that later.... Some background: My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier. He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband). He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food. Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison. Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Superstore. I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...). So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats. Titan went mad for them. It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares. You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky. But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw. Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door. He barely lifted his head from the bowl. For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France. When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure. Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine. Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept. When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet. I added a little canned venison to entice him. No go. Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating. Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there. Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag. Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag. I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time. The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO! But back to my point: I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!). So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain. And, it is high quality. Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam? Titan's never had that with this stuff. I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up. So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line. I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!). I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well. …",18 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 I devour these food morsels!,4,"When it's time for my evening meal, I often enjoy these tasty dry grains. This specialized indoor formula, made just for me because I am the most important being on earth, keeps me fit and healthy by reducing my fat intake. If I'm awake when Nathan get's home, I come rocketing into the kitchen to get my scoop of Purina Cat Chow. Sometimes I'm so hungry I can't contain myself and eat my food in a manner that is, uh, well let's just say it's not always dignified. Sometimes I wish that there were a few more pounds of food in that bag, as I have to send Nathan out to get me more on bi-weekly basis. That's ok though, as he is here to serve me. I've been pestering him to write this review for a while now, and it's good to know that other supreme beings like myself might benefit from my thoughts.

 Another satisfied pet owner,5,"We've had dogs and cats for years and always fed them Science Diet or Iams. Our newest dog was an itcher and after research, I decided to try a new dog food. I settled on Canidae for the same reason as the other reviewers; top notch ingredients at a reasonable price. She loves it. I alternate dry with dry/wet every other day. And, best of all, no more itching or hot spots. Vet believes that she was allergic to corn products in Iams; a common allergy for dogs. And the added benefits are about the poop; less poop to pick up, poop is solid, not runny, and like the other reviewer said, the poop is way less smelly. …",19 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Great flavor!,3,"This is a tricky product to review. On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter). If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars. However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity. It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons. however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter. So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days). But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor. So I would repurchase this but only for adding to shakes. …",180 out of 188 users found this review helpful
