" too sweet, but there's a cure.",3,"No,this isn't the ""old fashioned"" cocoa mix, there's just too much sugar in it. However, you can buy unsweetened cocoa in bulk and mix it in 50/50 and now you're getting a real hot chocolate. Of course, you can adjust the ratios to taste, 50/50 is kind of hardcore.

 Great price for small bag,5,"I purchased these for my husbands candy bin in his office at work. In case you wonder how many fireballs are in 16 oz. (like I did) there are 78 fireballs in this bag. I debated on purchasing this 1# bag or the 200 ct. container and went with this size for easy transportation as we live overseas and I'll pack these in my suitcase. The price comparison is negligible, with this 1# bag being slightly cheaper. These are very difficult to find in stores.

This was a nice surprise. It tastes like sugar and doesn't have a nasty after taste. I used it to bake a sugar free cheesecake, and it came out perfect with no bitter after taste.

" Healthy Cat Food, less stinky outcome",5,"I love Fionna, really I do. She is sleek and black and such a cat. However, her daily doody brought tears to my eyes.

" Tasty herbs, but why these?",4,"Well, this is the kit I tried first, and the back row of plants & center front are doing the best. Both basils shoot right out of their pods. The Dill and Cilantro are growing tall, and there is lots of mint, but it is tiny. The chives are looped back into the sponge & have yet to try to stand up straight, and the Oregano is sprouting within the sponge, but has yet to come out of hiding. And this is at the beginning of week 2. I believe I could probably harvest a little basil at the end of week 3. The big question is, where is the Parsley? People have suggested they substitute Parsley for Oregano. I'd rather they replace the Red Rubin basil. I have recipes with oregano, but none specifically calling for purple basil. However, I never tasted the stuff, so I may change my mind once I do. Hopefully they included it becase of taste and not for looks. This is an easy, low maintenence kit. You only have to refil the water bowl when the water gets low & add 2 nutrient tablets every 2 weeks. It comes with 2 starter nutrients, 2 sprouting nutrients & 12 regular nutrient tablets They ask you to place the pods in the order they came in the box. Possibly because of slightly variable light levels. The light is on 17 hours and it only waters when the light is on for this setting. Parsley will be part of both the Italian & French herb kits that will be available in September. …",36 out of 40 users found this review helpful
 Not Vegetarian,2,"FYI: These tasty-looking cookies contain fish. If you aren't vegetarian, none of this will probably matter to you. Nor should it. If you are vegetarian, read on . . . This product kept coming up in my recommendations here on Superstore so, when I spied it at Global Food, I picked it up. Being vegetarian, I'm used to checking the ingredients of any new product I try. I was disappointed to find that these cute 'lil mushroom cookies contain fish oil, so I can't eat them. Too bad, considering how much everyone seems to like them. I think it's kind of a bummer that I keep seeing fish oil used in cookies when there are other options that would make a product edible to a greater portion of the population. I found a similar Korean product from Isong called ""Choco Biscuit"" which is pretty good and made with vegetable oil (although, unfortunately, it is not available on Superstore).

 We love it - safe rawhide that lasts!,5,"This thing is HUGE and my Great Dane absolutely adores it! I purchased 2 chews, a knotted one and this braided one, and I must say that I am very happy. That's saying a lot because I usually hate rawhide -- my dog normally devours most rawhide treats in about 15 minutes and during that time manages to tear off at least one soft wet chunk big enough to choke on and scare the daylights out of me. These are designed in a way those scary moments haven't happened! These chews are truly CHUNKY - the ring is easily over 8 inches diameter and the braid is about 3 inches across, the rawhide is super thick and the whole thing is HEAVY. The braided design makes it so he cannot pull large pieces off to choke on and he has to work very hard to get even small pieces off. Normally if he has to work hard at a chew he will just give up - but not these! He carries it all over the house, plays with it by throwing it in the air (which is very loud on my wood floor), and then settles down for some chewing time -- this chew keeps him entertained for a good hour or more. In this hour of chewing he does NOT devour the rawhide like many other brands we have tried, he just barely manages to get a small 4 inch section gnawed soft then gets tired and takes a nap. In 3 days he has not gotten bored with this routine and we still have 98% of the original chew left! To me - that is a cost effective chew toy! He seems to prefer this braided ring over the knotted type - maybe because the circle design enables him to hold the chew firmly with his paws (see picture) or maybe because of the tasty beef basting. Even more impressive is that the basting looks to be thoroughly embedded into and throughout all of the rawhide not just brushed on the outside; it does not come off on his white legs or my beige carpet - how WONDERFUL is that?! I feel it is important to note that these are all-natural rawhide chews MADE IN THE USA (Illinois). They do say ""a product of Brazil"" on the outside of the package because they are made from free range, natural grass-fed BRAZILIAN beef hides (without chemicals, preservatives or bleaches). They are also antibiotic, hormone and preservative free. All of their rawhide products are lot-coded for traceability back to the cow. They are a PetAg product (a USA company founded in 1930) which is a division of Borden (another USA company). So in closing: They might seem a bit expensive at first glance, but I have discovered they are high quality, long lasting, and dog entertaining... that to me is worth every penny and if my dog ever makes it through the 2 chews I we already have -- I will happily purchase more! …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful
" Some are good, some are not so much.",4,"Some of the flavors we have tried: Diet Cola I do not like diet cola. I don't like diet Coke, diet Pepsi or diet other drinks. We bought this flavor so we could make diet drinks for someone who might like a diet cola when we were making our own soda. However, this is really one of the better diet drinks that I have tried. If you make your own soda, this is a good one to try. Orange This is the best one by far of all of the flavors we have tried. This flavor tastes just like the fanta orange soda. We love this one. Cola This cola flavoring is ok. It's not great. You can easily make simple syrups that will not be a cola flavor but will taste much better than this flavor. This is the equivalent of RC Cola.

 Get these if need a POWERFUL LAXATIVE,1,"I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch. They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects. Within about 7 hours after eating these my stomach started feeling awkward. Shortly after I started having cramps and severe watery diarrhea several times throughout the evening and late night. Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum. The package I purchased said cellulose gum on the ingredients list, but on the web sites it is listed as carboxymethylcellulose. You will find they are synonyms if you Google them. All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping. If you look up this ingredient, or look it up along with ""side effects"" you will find it is undigestible and can cause side effects such as bloating and diarrhea. Never again. All I can say is please post a review if this happened to you to others are forewarned! …",15 out of 20 users found this review helpful

 Unwelcome Side Effects,2,"I've been using Wellness ""Just for Puppy"" dry dog food mix ever since I brought my French Bulldog puppy home with great results. My pup simply loves his dog food and happily chows down at every meal. With the positive results from the puppy food I decided to try out these Wellness ""Just for Puppy Treats"". Unfortunately, even though the ingredient list is impressive - real pieces of lamb & salmon along with a mix of veggies and fruit - the results have been less than ideal. These treats cause my pup to have room-clearing gas and make his stool extremely runny. I planned on using these treats for obedience training and positive reinforcement for house breaking.

 Where's The Cardamon?  Prepare for the Cloveaload!,1,"If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you. If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is ""this is NOT chai tea."" There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea. As it is, it should be called ""spicy clove tea."" This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices. It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves. I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region. Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors. Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision. I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically. I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a ""traditional"" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand. For all the people out there who know what Indo-Pakistani Chai tastes like, I'll be reviewing each of the ""chai"" K-Cups according to how they resemble the original. …",21 out of 29 users found this review helpful

" Very tasty, but not healthy or nutritious",4,"Think of this as a candy/snack bar rather than a granola bar and you will not be disappointed. It's very sweet and tasty, but there's little or no nutritional value in here, despite being made from oats. The product is heavily processed and definitely what anyone would call healthy. Made with natural and artificial flavors, the ingredients list is very long (see bottom of review). It's loaded with sugar and not something you want to give yourself or your kids on a regular basis. Note how many times sugar or its variants appear in the list (glucose, fructose). Each bar is 1.23 oz. Daily value: Fiber 1g (5%), Vitamin A (0%), Vitamin C (0%), Calcium (10%), Iron (2%). 150 calories per bar (40 from fat), 11g of sugar. I'm giving the product 4 stars based on taste and texture. It's chewy, but not hard like Nature Valley granola bars. Ingredients: granola (whole grain rolled oats, whole grain rolled wheat, brown sugar, sunflower oil, high fructose corn syrup, dried coconut, honey, sodium bicarbonate, natural flavor, whey and whey protein concentrate), yogurt flavored coating (sugar, palm kernel and palm oil, whey protein concentrate, yogurt flavored powder, soy lecithin, natural flavor, artificial color, citric acid, salt), corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, brown rice crisp (whole grain brown rice, sugar, malted barley flour, salt), brown sugar, glycerin, vegetable shortening (canola oil, palm and palm kernel oils), corn flakes (milled corn, sugar, salt, malted barley extract), whey mineral concentrate, oat flour, rice flour, sweetened dried strawberries (glucose syrup, strawberries, high fructose corn syrup, modified potato starch, sodium alginate), corn syrup solids, sorbitol, salt, sugar, modified food starch, soy lecithin, natural flavor, malted barley flour, sodium bicarbonate, BHT (a preservative), citric acid, water.

 Detailed reply from company over infant feeding and DHA/ARA,5,"MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Hey guys, So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs. So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks! THEIR ANSWER Dear Dave, Thank you for contacting Nature's One®. Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic® formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions. Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic® formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic® falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5. Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246. The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic® formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic® formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus. Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue. If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider. DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare. Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin. However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome. Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season. The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age. (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, ""The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children,"" Allergy 56; 5:403 I hope this information is helpful to you.

" A most delicious absinthe, and higly recommended!",5,"K&uuml;bler is a Swiss blanche absinthe, which means than when poured on a glass, you will not see the classic and sought-after green color, but just crystal clear liquid, like water or vodka. It does louche, of course, to a beautiful milky pearl color. I drank it with one sugar cube and 4-5 parts of water. As always, the main flavor is anise, with a hint of bitterness in the after taste, but subtle and enjoyable. Although I can not taste any other flavors, I would say that it provides a refreshing experience. Depending on your taste, you may skip the sugar and enjoy it anyway. I would recommend it for beginners better than the Lucid, although more experienced drinkers may find it lacks complexity. In any case, it will remain one of my favorites. P.S.

 M I S L A B E L E D......( H I D D E N  ---  L A B E L L E D )......T E A ?????,1,"I have been a fan of Jasmine Tea for quite a while. Several years ago, I had my first taste of TWINNINGS Jasmine Tea, and fell in love with the sweet, delicate flavour....totally different from even the ""English Breakfast Tea"" made by the same company. Though ""English Breakfast Tea"", (and ""Darjeeling"", and even Fortum & Mason's ""Royal Blend"" tea are different from the usual ""Orange Pekoe"" or ""Orange Pekoe and Black"" teas, one usually gets bagged in the supermarket, these other 'rarified' teas are far more like the usual tea than Jasmine Tea. Jasmine Tea, (at least as made by Twinnings), will always be my total favourite. When I went to purchase some ""TWINNINGS Jasmine Tea"" through Superstore, they were out of it...thank goodness, as it turns out, temporarily. I didn't know this at the time...and so, I bought the ""substitute"" then offered...Sunflower Jasmine Tea. I figured that Jasmine Tea is Jasmine Tea, no matter who makes it ....right? And this Sunflower Tea DID seem slightly less expensive....so, I bought some. I have just had my first cup. It did NOT taste like the Jasmine Tea I so remember and appreciate. This is a very, very PALE tea in colour....and what is worse, the taste is somewhat peppery, (ulgh!)....with only the VERY slightest hint of the wonderful Jasmine Tea Flavour I remember. WHAT went wrong, I wondered. HOW could this be so different? Tea trees should know no nationality or political system! I was extremely bewildered and confused....for about five minutes. But I found out the reason, (I think), just before I started to write this review...seeking out the Sunflower Jasmine Tea for which I wanted to write a review. Amongst the ""Jasmine Teas"" listed are TWO TYPES of Twinnings Jasmine Tea. One is ""Jasmine Tea"", the other ""Jasmine Green Tea"". I suspect that THIS is the reason I so dislike the Jasmine Tea from Sunflower. It is NOT ""straight"" Jasmine Tea...but MUST be Jasmine Green Tea. And although Green Tea is said to have myriad health benefits, it sure doesn't make as tasty and satisfying a brew as Jasmine tea. Even when, it seems, it is MIXED with Jasmine Tea. One would expect people in the People's Republic of China to know the difference! And to label their tea accordingly! Not everyone, (including me!) is a tea expert...and the difference between ""Jasmine Tea"" and ""Jasmine Green Tea"" should be noted on the tea-box label, for tea novices, such as I...as it is, thoughtfully, by Twinnings Teas. I am, at present, extremely disappointed at the carelessness in labeling. Those who want ""Jasmine Tea"" only will, I am sure, be likewise disappointed by this probably-mislabeled-by-mistake-or-by-carelessness ""Jasmine Tea"". It is NOT ""Jasmine Tea"" to my palate -- it is, I am almost certain, ""Jasmine Green Tea"". There is SUCH a difference in taste!!!!!! I know Green Tea is good for one, and so I will keep this tea. I will combine it with the ""ordinary"" tea I find at the supermarket -- and which I find far more flavourful! (NOTE: Second cup of tea -- even mixed with ""ordinary"" orange pekoe tea, (two tea-bags!), is not to my taste. Therefore....as is listed in the ""NOTE: PS"", below, I HAVE DECIDED I AM NOT KEEPING this tea, but am putting it up for sale, for those who enjoy Jasmine Green Tea, (obviously some people do, as reflected in the other, sterling reviews of this tea), and would like it -- 1 pound minus two servings -- at a bargain price.) However, this tea is certainly not to MY taste. And so disappointed am I, that, unless there is a very, very great difference in price, I will stick to buying genuine, ""JASMINE Tea"", from Twinnings, (who takes the time and trouble to carefully label each TYPE of Jasmine Tea), from now on -- even if Sunflower does decide to mend it's ways and re-label its tea! A great flavor disappointment -- due to careless labelling! ............................................................. ............................................................. p.S. NOTE: Today, 12th March, 2009 -- two days after I have written this review -- and about 6 days after I have received this tea, I have FINALLY seen that, yes indeedy....the package DOES say, ""Green Tea With Jasmine Flowers"" -- on the BACK of the tin, in smallish lettering! One cannot see the BACK of the tin from the Superstore illustration! From the ""Product Description"", it states that ""Jasmine Tea is one of the most pleasant-tasting green teas available...."" -- but does NOT mention any differentiation between the two varieties: ""Jasmine Tea"", ane ""Jasmine Green Tea"" -- as Twinnings Teas thoughtfully does. Even from the ""Proudct Description"", which probably has been supplied by Sunflower, a novice would STILL not know there are two distinct and different TYPES of Jasmine Tea! AND THERE DEFINITELY ARE TWO VARIETIES: - I have been on the phone with my sister, and she concurs: she (also), LOVES plain Jasmine Tea, but detests Jasmine GREEN Tea. But -- I suppopose there ARE those who enjoy Jasmine Green Tea, looking at the ohter sterling reviews of this same tea. I don't like it. But I'm glad that there are those who do like it. I have had two cups of 5his tea -- and have revised my opinion about keeping it. I am putting it up for sale, via my Superstore shop. I may lose mnney in this transaction, but better that, (for me), than suffering through more of this Jasmine Green Tea. Besides, there PROBABLY ARE others who like it. I guess I'll not only be doing myself a favour -- but will also be doing my ""good deed"" for the day, by putting it up at a bargain price for those who truly enjoy Jasmine GREEN Tea! If you want to buy it, it's here -- used only twice, at the aforesaid bargain price! (Hey, that rhymes!) Note to Sunflower Teas: PLEASE LABEL YOUR TEAS MORE CAREFULLY FROM NOW ON! …",1 out of 21 users found this review helpful
" A perfect ""Anytime"" coffee that is sure to please.",5,"I have tried many, many brands and blends in my Keurig coffee maker and this is definetely one of my favorites. The type of coffe I drink depends on my mood. Sometimes I want a strong, bold cup like, Newman's Own Extra-bold Special Blend K-cups, 80 Pk for Keurig Brewers and sometimes I want something more mild like, Mountain K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108-ct.- Nantucket Blend But ever since I have had my Keurig I have been looking for one of my favorite coffees. The Dunkin Donut brand. This coffee is superb and very much like the Dunkin Donut brand. Not bold or bitter. Not weak or under flavored. It is smooth and very flavorful. It is the perfect crowd pleasing blend for any time of day or night. I have shopped all over and you can't beat the variety or the price here on Superstore when you join their club. A great value. I do wish that Superstore would change the name by removing ""Extra Bold"". It is not. It is, at most, a medium roast. Even when brewed with the smallest setting of the Keurig I would not concider it bold. It comes out great on the medium size setting. Very remanicent of that great cup of Joe you would get in the old days at your favorite diner. …",31 out of 32 users found this review helpful

 Inconsistent at best - too many hulls,3,"I enjoy hempseed, primarily I sprinkle it over my salads to add a nutty and nutritious component. I like buying this in bulk because it saves money over the expensive 1 pound or half-pound bags I can get at the store. My complaint about this product is that you never know what you'll get. Sometimes it's fairly free of hulls (seed coats) and sometime it's just full of them And they're hard to deal with - very hard pieces of shells that interfere with the enjoyment of whatever you are eating. I guess you could spend time separating the pieces out, but that is a labor-intensive process and at that point it becomes more economical (time is money) to buy the 1 pound or half-pound bag at the store from a company that pays more attention to what they are packaging. I kust got a new shipment and it is absolutely full of seed coat fragments. Grrrrr.... …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful

Not only is the aroma delightful, the flavor is excellent as well. I drink my coffee black and this one has no bitter after taste and the flavor isn't overpowering. The flavor is a very light coconut and the coffee is a medium body. I must admit that I was a little hesitant about a ""coconut"" flavor. DON'T BE!

 Five glorious pounds of GUMMI!,5,"I can't open this bag. It is just too beautiful. Five glorious pounds of gummi. It sits on my kitchen table. The rainbow of colors twinkling in the sunlight. Every time I get close to picking this HUGE bag up, my heart starts racing. These Gummis were made in Turkey and imported into Baltimore. The bag is not resealable so ensure you have some tupperware or a resealable bag when you open it. A resealable bag is a must. Gummis that have been exposed to air will harden and lose flavor. To waste a single, solitary gummi would be a crime. For those who track such things, the average gummi serving is 17 pieces. That serving will get you 140 calories. With FIVE pounds of gummis, you will be counting all night long. It takes, on average, approximately 45 minutes for a gummi to melt away in your mouth -- that is, if you can keep it in your mouth that long. Most people, myself included, will immediately start chewing on the gummi to get at the tasty fruit flavors. Speaking of flavors, let's talk about the goodness that goes into a gummi. There are many ingredients: Corn Syrup, Sugar, Gelatin, Dextrose, Citric Acid, Starch, Artificial and Natural Flavors, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Caarnauba Wax, Beeswax Coating, and Artificial Colors -- Yellow 4, Red 40, and Blue 1. I'm not sure how they cram all those ingredients into a gummi less than an inch tall and a 1/4 wide...but they do...and it tastes amazing. Even now, as I write this review, I'm enjoying a pair of gummis. My mouth is doing a dance as I type. You won't be disappointed. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

" More expensive for less formula, gave my baby very painful gas",1,"My daughter has been on Nutramigen Lipil for about 5 months now for her acid reflux. It has really helped with her spitting up and digesting the food quicker. Since the stores in our area decided to discontinue carrying this type of formula and started stocking the Nutramigen with Enflora, I've had to switch over to using that instead. For one thing, it is much more expensive. It's a 12.6 oz can instead of a 16 oz. can. The scoop inside is much larger so you are using more formula per bottle. They say the reason for the scoop being larger is that the formula is less dense. In any case, it is still costing you more money (as if it wasn't expensive enough already.) In our case, our daughter is now suffering very painful gas pains, especially in the middle of the night, since we've started using this new type of formula. She is also pooping much more frequently during the day. Before she would go about once a day, now it's about 4 times a day. I've called Enfamil to see how I could obtain the original formula and they looked up their past orders to see who in my area has ordered it recently. All the names they gave me were stores I am familiar with and have personally checked to see if they stocked it, which they do not. Fortunately, I found a case of it here on Superstore for much cheaper then they (Enfamil) or any grocery store could ever offer. I'm not sure why they felt it necessary to add Enflora to this formula if for no other reason than to make even more money. I strongly recommend that if you are going to start your child on Nutramigen, to get the formula that does NOT contain Enflora. Check with your pediatrician first to see if they have any free samples they can give you. I am eagerly awaiting my case of Nutramigen Lipil so that I can once again enjoy a full night of sleep without waking up to my baby crying out in pain. …",14 out of 19 users found this review helpful

" Super, Super Delicious Miso Paste",5,"My wife and I decided that we wanted to begin having miso soup for dinner on a more regular basis, so purchased this miso paste as an essential ingredient for my miso soup recipe. I was totally impressed with the amazing taste and overall product quality. Needless to say, I am reordering and will continue to do so. I want to say that my picky kids love my Miso soup as well -- for kids that seem to only want mac & cheese, they are gorging themselves on (much healthier) miso soup now. This makes me happy. By the way, I also highly recommend the Morinu firm silken tofu and the Ajinomoto Hon Dashi Soup Stock which I both purchased from Superstore. If interested, my Miso Soup recipe is as follows: 1 package of Morinu firm silken tofu, 2 tsp Dashi soup stock, 3 Tbs white miso paste (this stuff), 4 cups of water and 2 chopped scallions -- we also reconstitute shitake mushrooms, add dried wakame seaweed (highly recommend either Eden or Emerald Cove from Superstore as well), add shaved daikon, etc. However, this recipe is awesome just as is... We live in Northern California with some of the best Japanese restaurants in the world, but this recipe blows away (or at least equals) what you can get from any restaurant. I have also made an amazing miso salad dressing from this miso paste as well! But I digress... I highly recommend this miso paste! …",24 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Nutri-NOT Bars,1,"These bars are a great example of a sneaky marketing ploy by a major food corporation. By using the word ""Nutri"" as part of the name of the product, consumers are tricked into thinking these are healthy. These should really be called CANDY-GRAIN bars! Here's the nutritional low down: 1. These bars contain 13 grams of sugar. (Notice the first ingredient in the ""filling"" is strawberry preserves, made of high fructose corn syrup and strawberries. The next ingredient is...corn syrup, followed by fructose, which is also a sweetener.) More sweeteners appear on down the ingredients list. Out of the 140 calories in this tiny bar, 62 calories come from sugar. 2. These bars have partially hydrogenated oil in them. That's the type of oil that contains artery clogging trans fat. Yuck. 3. They contain less than 1 gram of fiber. That means that the bars include very, very little whole grain or fruit, either of which would increase fiber content. 4. They do contain some vitamins. But these are all in the form of additives. (They are listed at the end of the ingredient list.) Essentially, they've ground up a bit of a vitamin pill into each bar. Obviously, there's no need to eat candy to get powdered vitamins. If you want the extra vitamins--just take a vitamin pill! 5. While they were at it, they added 5% DV of sodium per bar. I am not opposed to enjoying junk food now and then. If these bars tasted great, I might indulge in one as dessert from time to time. However, there's lots of junk food I like better...so I won't bother with these bars. A better choice, for taste and nutrition, is TLC Crunchy Granola Bar - Pumpkin Spice Flax, 6 - 1.4 oz Bars, 8.4 oz or one of the other Kashi bars. Or real strawberries, of course!

 My personal fave,5,"My husband gave me a Keurig coffee maker, so we've been trying different flavors of coffee. To me, I don't care about brand necessarily, I just like flavored coffee. On the top of my list are Gloria Jean's assorted flavors (Hazelnut, French Vanilla, White Chocolate -- I think). That one also includes a Mudslide flavor, but we thought it had a slight coconut taste we didn't care for. I like the Kahlua brand Kahlua coffee, but the flavor portion is a little strong. But my VERY, VERY, VERY favorite flavor is this Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle flavor. It's just the right balance of ""coffee"" to ""flavor"" ratio. You can taste it, but still taste the coffee. And my kitchen smells heavenly! But a lot of it boils down to personal taste and preferences. If you typically like this type of flavored coffee, you will love this flavor. And I definitely recommend Subscribe and Save for K-cups if you have a Keurig. It's the most economical way to get them. You get a discount and free shipping. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Meh,3,"We got the twenty-four-piece multi-pack, which comes with four flavors: Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, Strawberry, and Sour Apple. The ingredients for the Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, and Strawberry are: ""organic apple puree, organic apple juice concentrate, organic flavor, pectin, colored with fruit and vegetable juice."" Also, some vitamins and minerals are added. Sour Apple ingredients are exactly the same, except there is no coloring added. The ""organic flavor"" ingredients are not specified, nor are the fruit and vegetable juices used for color. We can assume that these ingredients do vary among the different flavored fruit ropes, but we don't know what they are. These fruit ropes do not have the fruit taste we thought they should. Our family didn't like them very much. They aren't terrible -- we just don't think they're good enough to purchase again; but maybe that's just because we're accustomed to natural foods. The ingredients aren't bad either, but they're nothing exciting -- as far as we can tell, they're just apple (pectin comes from apples) with anonymous color and flavor enhancers (and the supplemental vitamins and minerals). Additionally, among the Tropical Twist flavored fruit ropes were several that had not been packaged properly. The ropes were sticking out the bottoms of the wrappers, having been squished along with the wrapper when the machinery pressure/heat sealed them. The reviewers who thought these were very chewy must have gotten stale ones. The fresh ones are on the softer side, but still sticky. (Braces wearers, beware.) For small, individually-wrapped dried fruit treats, I would recommend Stretch Island fruit leather instead. These contain the fruits named in their flavors (e.g. the ingredients in Stretch Island's ""orchard cherry"" fruit leather are: apple puree concentrate, cherry puree concentrate, orange puree concentrate, natural black cherry flavor) and they taste like those fruits, too, without being too sweet or tart or sticky. …",31 out of 36 users found this review helpful

 The BEST for masa,5,"I didn't realize that this was 'the' brand to use for making arepas, but it doesn't surprise me at all to find out. My friends and I used to use Maseca when we made arepas on the weekends, or the morning after a party at our house to fuel the clean-up effort and for whomever was still hanging around. After more than half a decade of doing this we stumbled upon PAN and realized just how much better it is at making a beautiful smooth almost creamy masa. The results are not even comparable. Luckily we can get it quite easily in any grocery store in or around DC, I'm sorry to here that you have a hard time finding it in CA-- that's surprising. So this review is really for comparison of brands. So as far as that's concerned, this is it. If you are thinking of ordering corn flour/corn meal on the internet for making tamales, arepas, tortillas, etc. this is the brand. And since I'm writing a review anyhow, I might as well share, this is how we make arepas: Mix PAN white corn meal with water and a bit of salt to make a masa (dough) which should be wet enough to easily form into thick smallish pancake like forms in your hands, but shouldn't come off in little globs sticking to your fingers. However you will get sticky hands eventually. Cook these on a medium heat using a cast iron skillet lightly greased with olive oil until the arepas are nicely browned on both sides, then transfer them to the oven to keep warm while you finish the rest. I like to make my arepas fairly thick, about 3/4"" and 5-6"" in diameter. Made that way not many people can eat more than 2, because then of course there are the fillings.... Grate some fresh mozzarella cheese, put 2-3 cans of Black Beans - 24 Pack in a pot with chopped green onion and a little salt. Simmer on a medium low heat like that until they look and taste done. They should be served hot so if they finish before everything else is ready just re-heat them before serving. Guacamole and salsa are also a must, and you can have a little extra chopped cilantro on the table for people to add if they like. For the salsa, chop about one small red onion very finely. If you find raw red onion too sharp a taste you can soak it, once it's chopped, briefly in a bowl with salt water to draw out some of that intensity. Finely dice 3-4 large ripe tomatoes removing most of the watery bits. Mix with the red onion, juice of half a lime, add some chopped cilantro and salt and pepper to taste. Only add the salt just before serving as it will draw out the juices in the tomatoes. Or instead add half - 1 pack of Goya Saz&oacute;n Sazon Goya Clntro/achte, 1.41-Ounce Units (Pack of 36) . For the guacamole, use 5 ripe avocados chopped and then continue to mash with your hands. I usually give this job to some poor helplessly polite and obliging guest, but trust me it tastes better that way. Not when a guest does it but when it's done by hand. You still get some nice chunks because hands just can't squeeze it all out before even the most obliging guest will ask to be excused, but it's still nice and smooth. Come on, don't be so fastidious! They'll wash their hands! Season with finely chopped cilantro, fresh lime juice (the importance can not be stressed enough of only ever using freshly squeezed lime juice, whether you're making a gin and tonic or guacamole-- no exceptions. And the same goes for lemon juice.), continue seasoning with salt and cumin powder. Add to all of this some finely diced tomatoes and even more finely chopped red onion as well as some completely pulverized jalepano and you'll have a killer guac. All of these things can be put out in bowls for guests to add to their arepas in whatever combination or ratios they prefer. But if you're taking beans and cheese I don't know why you would put them next to each other so that the warm delicious re-fried beans can slightly melt the cheese. Like I said before, you can also have a small bowl of chopped cilantro and or chopped green onion and or sour cream for people to add as well. &iexcl;Buen provecho! …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,5,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food. This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats. What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic. Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it. …",12 out of 14 users found this review helpful

My rationale: If 42% protein in this food is not for a high energy and athletic dog like mine, then what kind of a dog is this suitable for! Although the ingredients are good, protein levels are too high for any dog and most of it is not digestible. So this food is not good.

 a total scam,1,"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes. I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for: #1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and #2) for pricing it so ridiculously high. Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt. Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick: Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil). That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN. That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience. Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor. It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple. Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for: rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store), sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) , potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store), baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials), salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's), xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Superstore). Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum. Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix. I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick. But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product. MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE! Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months. Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder. Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder. It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups). To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix."" Boo on Betty Crocker. …",10 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 Supply Shortage so Product Coming From Sri Lanka not Thailand,2,"I love their product from Thailand. I don't like the product from Sri Lanka. The content of coconut oil is higher in Sri Lanka made coco milk, throwing off the consistency. I don't want to have to warm the coconut oil prior to using in a cold smoothie, it will just chunk up anyway. Wrote the manufacturer - here's the reply From the manufacturer: Thank you for writing. Due to worldwide surging demand for coconut milk during its lean harvest season, our primary organic packer in Thailand is unable to keep up with our volume of sales. Therefore we have added a trusted organic coconut facility in Sri Lanka as our secondary supplier. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka uses a slightly different processing method than Thailand does and the Sri Lankan product has more tendency to separate when its temperature falls below 80 degrees F. This makes the milk appear curdled as the coconut fat separates from the liquid. Such separation is harmless and easily remedied by placing the can of coconut milk in hot water for 15 minutes and then stirring the contents thoroughly. We regret this inconvenience, especially since consumers have come to really value the smoother, creamier consistency of our Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk. While all natural and organic coconut milk will separate in cool temperatures, the Thailand milk is more smooth and homogeneous. Faced with lengthy stock shortages during an exceptionally lean coconut season, we decided to accept the different coconut milk consistencies from two supply lines rather than have no organic coconut milk at all during this six month lean period. We are only shipping Thai sourced coconut milk as of right now, but distributors and stores may still have Sri Lankan sourced product. Thank you for your patience and your understanding.

 Where's The Cardamon?  Prepare for the Cloveaload!,1,"If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you. If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is ""this is NOT chai tea."" There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea. As it is, it should be called ""spicy clove tea."" This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices. It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves. I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region. Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors. Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision. I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically.

" A perfect, natural sugar substitute",5,"Now Foods' erythritol is a sugar substitute made from corn. By fermenting the corn's sugars, the manufacturer produces a naturally-occurring sugar alcohol product. Sugar alcohols taste exactly like sugar, but without the calories and blood sugar spike. And they are alcohols in chemistry terms only, not to be confused with the kind of alcohol one finds in adult beverages. PROS: * Tastes just like sugar and has no unpleasant aftertastes, unlike stevia. * Has a glycemic index of zero. Great for diabetics or those simply wishing to eliminate excess sugar from their diets. * Contains virtually no calories. * Made by a manufacturer committed to a wide range of sweeteners and food products, so the company is experienced and trusted in its field. * Erythritol occurs naturally in many foods. The FDA recognizes it as a viable and safe sugar substitute. Erythritol-based sweeteners have been on the market in other countries for years. * Unlike some other sugar alcohols such as xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, it will not cause gas if consumed in large amounts. * Not only does erythritol not promote tooth decay, it actually prevents it, inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth. * Can be used in baking. CONS: * Not quite as sweet as sugar. You need about a quarter to a third more erythritol by volume for an equivalent. * Though it tastes exactly like sugar, erythritol has a slight, mint-like, cooling effect on the tongue. In foods where that effect would be undesirable, erythritol would need to be combined with another sweetener to diminish the effect. (This effect seems to vary from person to person, too.) * In some clear liquids such as tea, adding erythritol will initially cloud the liquid, though the cloudiness fades quickly. (That issue probably comes from the release of oxygen bubbles as the product dissolves.) * Though it dissolves, erythritol does not do so as rapidly as sugar. It will retain its granularity in some foods. (Some people recommended powdering it to compensate.) * Because it involves more steps to make than corn syrup or sugar, this is not a cheap product. Perhaps in the future, economies of scale will drive the price down. Many companies are discovering the benefits of erythritol as a natural sugar substitute that lacks the nagging questions that dog artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame. Now Foods' erythritol is one of the best values in this natural sweetener on the market, available at a much lower price point than some competitors' products. Though not cheap compared with sugar or some artificial sweeteners, as a healthy alternative, it more than makes up for its higher cost. Definitely recommended. …",56 out of 59 users found this review helpful
 Refreshing and wholesome!,5,"This is Celestial Seasonings at their best-a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf, which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea! Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste. Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle. Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 A new favorite,5,"I have enjoyed Twinings teas for, oh, more than 20 years now. I was immediately suspicious of this new blend, if only because Twinings seemed to be attempting to capitalize on people's renewed appreciation for the tradition of afternoon tea. Too often, especially in America, this meal is referred to as ""high tea"" to make it sound like a fancy event, even though high tea and afternoon tea differ in ways that have nothing to do with elegance. English Afternoon Tea sounded a little quaint, and Twinings already offers so many varieties of tea that it was hard to believe there could be anything new that would be worthwhile. As it happens, this tea is my new favorite. It doesn't have the dainty flavorings or fragrance of Earl Grey or Lady Grey, my former favorites, nor does it contain the thundering levels of caffeine in English or Irish Breakfast Tea. Instead, it includes elements from both ends of the spectrum. Like the Lady and the Earl, it has little enough caffeine that I can toss back cup after cup without getting jumpy. And like the breakfast teas, it has more of a bold black-tea edge that in this case isn't masked by bergamot or citrus notes. But with English Afternoon Tea, this edge is mellower and more refined than in the breakfast teas. It has more interest and character than a simple orange pekoe (the baseline for black tea) but without resorting to bitter or acerbic flavors. Any tea drinker should enjoy English Afternoon Tea. It's surprisingly good, and despite the name, it's a fine way to start the day. I only wonder why Twinings didn't come up with it sooner! One final thought: Adding a little milk to tea--never cream, although at afternoon tea, it's properly called cream--causes the tannins in the tea to attack the milk proteins. As a result, the tannins are neutralized and won't attack your tongue. What this means for you is that the tea will cause less of the dry, mouth-puckering sensation you might have encountered eating walnuts or drinking dry red wine. If you've never tried milk in your tea, I recommend adding just a little. For a fascinating little blurb about how tea led to urbanization (who knew?), click here.

" The ""Best"" Licorice",5,"I am a black licorice lover. Over the years, I have eaten licorice products from around the world. My sister sent me Black Licorice Scottie Dogs as a gift, and I fell in love with them. I next found them in The Fresh Market, where they are sold by the pound, at a price that caused me to buy them only on a periodic basis. Then I did some research and found that Gimbal's makes them and that I could by them through Superstore . I ordered a box, which is a supply that can last a very long time. My friends and neighbors discovered them in the small candy dish my wife keeps on the large island in our kitchen. I had to order 2 more boxes to fill all the requests to have a bag of the great little treats. A box contains two (2) 5 lbs. bags. The bag is plastic and sealed tightly, so the licorice remains fresh for a long time. When you compare the price of a 10 lbs. box versus what specialty food stores charge per pound, the box is by far the better deal. According to experts: ""Licorice is in fact a powerful antiviral that contains 10 antioxidants, at least 25 fungicidal and 9 expectorant compounds. Licorice also includes MAO inhibitors, several XO inhibitors, and natural estrogenic ingredients. But this is not all that helps to form licorice.

 Love at first bite!  Tongue-puckering tang and crunch!,5,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy. I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten. It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since. Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly. I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch. Isn't that poetic? As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C. My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches. I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.

 1 out of 2 dogs liked it!,4,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:42 Mins </span>Since neither of my 2 dogs can write about this new Lickety Stik, I will do my best. A new idea for treats is always welcomed. We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver. We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey. Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol). Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike. I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it. First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly. It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog. If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable. It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label. The video is one of our taste tests. Hope you enjoy it. …",19 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 High-quality salt!,5,"I would like to start out by saying that I am picky about salt. Iodized salt has no character and kosher salt can be very overpowering. Sea salt can be a hit or miss. Some sea salts can be intensely salty while others lack any panache. But this salt is beautifully pink and its flavor is mild and balanced with a wonderful finish. It has the character and class expected of a salt in its category. Extra points for packaging..I loove the space-efficient airtight design with screw on lid. It's easy to store in my already full spice cabinet. And the price is perfect. Kudos for affordability, health benefits, design, ease of use, and taste!!!!! …",22 out of 22 users found this review helpful
 Wonderful Product - Deserves More Attention,5,"I recently purchased this product without the subscribe and save deal, and man, was I wrong! I will definitely be purchasing Red Rain on a subscription basis. This product tastes much LESS bitter than the leading brand, but tastes better. It is almost sweet, but verrry light on the palate. I quite enjoyed sipping it. I ordered the extra strength because it is cheaper and has more bang-for-your-buck. I generally will drink half a bottle at once and judge where I am over the next half hour. If I need the extra boost, I will go for sipping the latter half of the bottle over the next half hour until my energy is right where I want it, then save the rest for later. Brilliant! when you can buy an extra-strength shot at LESS THAN HALF the original strength leading shot price! I believe this product may be the ""hidden gem"" of energy drinks. It is hard enough to find a cheaper energy drink that even matches the higher-priced, but tasty, competitor(s), yet this one supercedes them all! I have tried 5-hour Energy ($$), Energy 2000 Berry Flavor (taste? energy?), Monster shots (ok), 6-hour power (ok), and above all, Red Rain Extra Strength Berry (the best!)

 Luscious Lemon Luxury,5,"I had a craving for a lemon something sweet. Not pie. Not candy. Cake? Oh, a bit too much. But the craving would not go away. I thought about baking some lemon cookies, but dismissed that idea. I'm a good baker, but I was not in the mood for it. So I went to the supermarket and checked at the bakery. I got donut. Well, I didn't buy donuts; I mean the bakery had no lemon cookies. Then I checked the cookie aisle. These were the only lemon cookies I could find. I was shocked! And they were on the top shelf at the end of the aisle, where the merchandisers like to place the pricey stuff. Not that one could miss that green and yellow package, and why do they show a cockatiel? I was skeptical, but the craving had evolved into an obsession, so I bought them, expecting to be completely disappointed. They are wonderful! Best new cookie I've tried in many years. These are sandwich cookies with more heft than Oreos. The cookie is made short and not too sweet. The cream is a perfect concoction of smooth, lemony and sweet. The overall flavor and texture of this cookie is truly fine. They are unquestionably lemon, but not overbearing. Best of all, these go wonderfully with tea. There's nothing worse than an overly sweet cookie with tea! A perfect match with black, green or oolong. I wouldn't recommend them with a spiced tea. I enjoyed them very much with Organic Tea Magnolia Puerh, 16-Count Full Leaf Tea Bags (Pack of 2) Bonus points for those looking for cookies made in a nut-free factory. …",12 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Wedderspoon Raw Manuka Honey,5,My husband was told that he had h-pylori last year. I have to mention he also suffers from acid reflux and ibs. After a antibiotic treatment that consisted of 4500 mgs a day for 2 weeks the stubborn h-pylori was not affected and the burning from his throat to his bowels was still very present. I researched herbal remedies and found that this honey was a cure for most of what he suffered from. I said what do we have to lose. The antibiotics made him so sick he was not willing to go another round to hope they would get rid of it. So we ordered this honey and started the slow process of healing. I also have to mention that he did have a severe case of infection that had been prolonged over several years. The honey started to work after the first couple jars or about 2 tbls a day. Needless to say today after 3 months he is h-pylori free and he continues to take it for his acid reflux. It does everything it says. He takes it regularly and I would not be without it ever. It has made the difference in his and my life to be able to be pain free for the first time in years. Make sure you get 16 plus to get the full benefits. You wont be sorry.

 Definitely buy from The Sprout House,5,"I have placed several orders for sprouting seeds/beans from The Sprout House. They are of excellent quality and come in nice plastic jars resembling large spice jars for parsley and such. The seeds sprout uniformly and well, with negligible ""junk"", and are very tasty. In comparison, I had a very bad experience in buying seeds from another seller/producer that came in a cheap plastic bag that spilled all over the box and arrived in a black plastic trash bag from the post office. The quality/uniformity of those other seeds was nowhere near these from The Sprout House. If I am buying alfalfa sprouting seeds, I will ONLY buy these. Please see my customer images as well.

 INCREDIBLE WHEN MIXED WITH JELLY!,5,"I first purchased PB2 in Manhattan and was so excited about its great taste that I bought another four jars and mixed spoonfuls for colleagues at work. You can use PB2 as others have suggested, but I like it on sandwiches. My entire life I've been addicted to peanut butter, so much so that during college I ate 4 lbs of freshly ground health store peanut butter per week! I find that when I mix 2 TBSP of PB2 powder with jelly and put it on a sandwich it tastes as good as any peanut butter sandwich I've ever had. At 55, I'm blessed to be in great shape and have tried to stop eating peanut butter all together but it's impossible. So I'm here to order four more jars of what I consider to be a miracle: PB2! Mix it with jelly (even margarine or a little butter) and enjoy an extremely low fat, old fashioned peanut butter sandwich. …",129 out of 134 users found this review helpful
 Not a fan,4,"My favorite of the traditional Earl Grey teas is Bigelow. Personally, I find Twinings too light and a bit sour. My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and you don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo. If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont. I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception). Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves. …",16 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 WAY better than canned (prep instructions included),5,"I used to buy this product in bulk from Wild Oats, but haven't been able to find it in several years (Wild Oats was bought out by Whole Foods and the one near me doesn't carry this in bulk). I was so happy to find this product in bulk on Superstore (whether buying 12 7oz. boxes or buying the 3 3.3lb bags which is what I bought). Yes, it's a ton of mix, but I make this so often and it lasts practically forever provided it's kept sealed. The flavor is so far superior to anything canned and, dare I say, even better than refried beans made at home. This is mainly due to the extra flavorings added to the mix whereas home recipes usually only add salt and/or garlic. This product is perfect for anyone who loves refried beans and wants a convenient way to prepare them. I think it's incredible that something this easy and fast to prepare actually tastes better than something you can make at home (that also takes much longer). It's great for quick bean and cheese burritos or breakfast burritos (bean, cheese, and egg with some red sauce) and also great for campers. Plus, if you buy the 3 3.3lb bags, you can divide this product up and make as much or as little as you need. Preparation information: Many sites I researched for this product said to mix 1.75C boiling water with 1C of mix in a bowl, cover, and let sit for 5 mins. However, THIS IS INCORRECT and results in runny beans. I contacted the good folks at Fantastic Foods and was forwarded preparation instructions which are as follows. Pour 1.75C boiling water of 1 1/3C of mix in a bowl. Stir well, cover and let sit for 5 mins. I haven't tried this ratio yet as I just received the email and wanted to post a review including the instructions since they all seem to be incorrect everywhere I look. If the beans are still too runny for you, increase to 1.5C of mix and try that. I personally like my beans very thick for both eating plain and in burritos. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful
 Two Paws Up!,5,"My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them. But I needn't have worried, they loved it! The Tuna Too Cool is a rich-looking, reddish pate with lots of jelly on top and my twosome were wolfing their portions down and got into a bit of a scuffle over the last couple of mouthfuls. They have no higher praise. …",24 out of 25 users found this review helpful
 Rice and Beans 'til I die,5,"So I know this guy, and he's been eating these things at least 3 times a week for over, like, 10 years or more. Well I thought that was sort weird, ya know, at first... But then I found myself stranded at his house one day, forced to join him in a meal of Lipton Cajun Sides, Rice & Beans. And my life has never been the same since. Seriously. Ask any of my friends. A mushrooming explosion of zestful flavor (not actual mushrooms) in your mouth belies the simple and inexpensive 6.4-Ounce package. Did I mention it's Zesty? But the problem was, Lipton Cajun Sides, Rice & Beans, 6.4-Ounce Packages weren't available in any local stores. My friend (who I didn't think was so weird anymore) had to travel four hours north by motor vehicle just to buy them, year after year. But today we can celebrate our good friends at Superstore for making this hidden culinary nugget readily available to all (and for saving my friend a lot of gas money). And can you guess how I'm going to celebrate?? …",16 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Great alternative for those on grain free diet,5,"I am pleased with this product as a substitute for all grains. I am on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet to treat my celiac's disease, so I'm happy to find any substitute I can use for grain flours that will give me something to satisfy my need for something bready. I like to experiment in the kitchen and I have made a flour using navy beans that I cook, dehydrate, and grind into a flour which I mix with coconut flour and almond flour to make a banana bread that I can cut into squares and put in the freezer for a snack when I need to satisfy my cravings. This is a lot of work, but worth it for my health issues. I use egg white powder from Waltonfeed in place of regular eggs so that the end product of what I am baking doesn't taste too egg-y, which is a common complaint of using coconut flour. Because of coconut flour's high fat content, I try to lower the fat of my recipes using the bean flour and egg whites. This also increases the protein and fiber. BTW, the coconut flour is very high in fiber. Coconut flour has turned out to be a great ingredient for this celiac who is prone to blood sugar issues too. Whatever you are baking with coconut flour will become higher in fiber and lower in glycemic index. So far, I am very happy with it. You can't expect it to be a cup for cup substitute for any grain flour. Have faith in yourself to experiment with it and make up some of your own recipes. Another tip: I don't use oil in my recipes but add applesauce, mashed bananas, and blended dates to add moisture. I also don't need to add sweeteners when I use the mashed fruits in my breads, except for a couple tablespoons of honey. I haven't tried this as a substitute ingredient to making yeast bread, just quick breads and crackers, but I'm just looking for something to satisfy the bready craving, so I'm very happy with the results. This is great for those with blood sugar issues and celiac's! …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Dramatic changes!,5,"I had been feeding my cats a so-called ""quality"" food for years, until I found out about all the by-products and other junk it had in it. I have since been experimenting with various premium brands to find one that my cats liked and that they didn't barf up every other day. I've finally found the winning formula with this food. They love it and their hairballs have been greatly reduced. But there have been some other effects I hadn't counted on. My oldest cat (12 years) is suddenly acting like a kitten again. My younger cat (10 years) has always had a difficult coat which is now silky and rarely mats. And through Superstore, this brand is less expensive than many other premium brands.

 CANIDAE - a best choice for Fido or FiFi,5,"I searched for a food that wasn't full of preservatives and fillers, and didn't cost $5 a pound. I did alot of research and read alot of labels. I have a Siberian Husky pup, and Canidae has really proven itself to me. As a former conissour of cheap discount store dog foods, I have finally realized the advantages of feeding a natural premium food. My dogs poop doesnt really stink! True! Poop is still poop, but the smell is minimal. I have noticed it also quickly disinigrates into the ground when it rains. With the cheap food, it smelled like rank dog poop! Would make you retch and gag! And there was so much of it! Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day. AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog! A food that swells up when wet is also undesirable. Flint River Ranch brand and Canidae both stay intact, avoiding the bloat factor. I learned, you can learn too!

 Not a pet...,3,"I ordered this product as a gift for my four year old daughter, as I have fond memories of my mother giving me a pet rabbit for Easter when I was that age. ""Whole Rabbit"" indeed! To my utter disappointment, this rabbit lacked fur, a head, and numerous vital organs that provide that sense of comforting warmth that one would expect a whole rabbit to provide. Needless to say my child was quite unnerved upon unwrapping ""Snuggles"", and spent a large portion of her Birthday cowering in a corner. On top of everything else, after the first few days I noticed a terrible odor coming from the animal and my daughters comforter was splotched with impossible to remove stains. Perhaps it has educational value for older children, but I cannot recommend it as a gift for children under five. …",25 out of 29 users found this review helpful

 I'm not sure what to think . . . and neither does my dog,2,"I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this ""Lickety Stik"" device. It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works. My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it. This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those. The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet. It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat. Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out. You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring. I probably won't be buying this again. …",10 out of 15 users found this review helpful
