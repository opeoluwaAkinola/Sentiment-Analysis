 Just like Grandma used to make!,5,"I bought this product with trepidation because in the past I'd tried other fig preserves that were extremely disappointing - too much sugar, or bad figs, or somebody held their pinky the wrong way. Just bad. I held my breath when I opened up the Harvest Song Gourmet jar and took a spoonful out to taste. Then the heavens opened! Choirs of Angels sang! Tiny bluebirds rested on my shoulders! Okay, not really, but this stuff was the real thing - it tastes *exactly* like Grandma's homemade. Exactly. That she made in her kitchen in New Orleans 40 years ago with figs that Grandpa grew in the backyard. So if you are a fig lover, I highly recommend these preserves - they are to die for. If you've never tried figs or especially fig preserves, you don't know what you're missing! …",12 out of 12 users found this review helpful

 Yuck!,1,"I'm a big fan of Zevia sodas and drink several cans per day during the summer months. With that said and just to be fair, I have to tell you that I'm not a big root beer fan to begin with. In fact, I haven't drunk root beer in twenty years or more. So when I ordered Zevia's Ginger Root soda and tried my first can, I thought I was going to puke. This stuff tastes exactly like Pepto Bismol. But you have to remember something here, I'm not a fan of root beer, so maybe this is the way it's supposed to taste. I've read raving reviews about this flavor on other sites but it's just not for me. That's why I had to give it one star. My opinion is subjective like any other one, but if you like root beer, I think you won't be too disappointed because my taste buds tell me that they have a good product, but one I can't enjoy. I know how strange that must seem to you but I can appreciate something even though I may not like it on another level. …",4 out of 17 users found this review helpful

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",11 out of 15 users found this review helpful

 Warning!!1,1,"I too researched the best dog food for my dog. I wanted her to have the best and EVO was listed as one, based on the composition of the food. Hundreds of dollars later, and a dog who can't keep solid food in and has to take Gall Bladder and Liver medicine, I was forced to go back to research the food. Finding that the composition has indeed changed, I've throw it all out. Three hundred dollars in dog food and at least that much in Vet bills and medicine, I've switched to Eukanuba.

 How to hook a cat,5,"I gave these a try with finicky, picky Emmy, only because everything else--Pounce, Friskies, the gourmet little cans--had pretty much failed. (I have no idea what she lives on, because she's determined to show me she's above eating anything I offer her.) Much to my amazement, she's crazy about these Greenies' treats and would easily consume an entire package, even in my presence, if I let her. She's making me feel a little bit like her ""dealer,"" and now that we're momentarily out of her drug of choice, I'm feeling a bit guilty, as though it's my fault she's going through cold turkey withdrawal. I guess I have no choice but to order another supply and, in the meantime, endure the combination of her loud complaints and constant tapping of her forepaw on my shoulder to remind me of my duty and heartless dereliction. I just hope I don't have to bring her to a specialist in feline addictive counseling. …",19 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************,2,"First off, the initial arrival: It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat! Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary. Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective; 1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces 2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several. 3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging. In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags. Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's. Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way. But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Superstore charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping). If you wanted to buy using Superstore Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings. An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats …",1 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 Opted for a more cost effective route,5,"I have a 20lb pug and had bought a similar product for medium size dogs. He chewed them up in about 2 min, not very useful for cleaning his teeth. Many people had said that the dog bites off big chunks at a time. SO what i did was bought the bag for Large dogs (same price or may have been a few cents less actually) and i cut them in half. They are a bit thicker so it takes him a long time to chew them up and this way you get TWICE as many. He LOVES them and they don't upset his tummy which is great because almost anything does. …",33 out of 33 users found this review helpful
" Not Peanut Butter, Peanut Flavored Peanut Butter",2,"I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair. The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter? The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again ""regular"" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food. Pros +lower calorie +great price here on Superstore +does taste similar to peanut butter Cons -less nutritional value -doesn't taste like real peanut butter I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else. …",13 out of 16 users found this review helpful

 Knorr Salad Dressing,5,"Delicious. What more can one say? The preparation directions are confusing since they are written in German. But a call to a German friend cleared it up.

 Very Pleasant Taste,5,"I tried all the green superfoods from no flavor to berry and believe me, the chocolate is the best one. It almost reminds me of those instant breakfast chocolate drinks I use to drink as a kid. I am a really picky when it comes to tastes with eating and drinking natural things that are good for you. What most people think is an acceptable taste from vitamins to energy drinks and bars, I usually never agree. I have to admit, for a healthy drink the taste pretty darn good and I have to mix mine with rice milk since I am allergic to regular milk. I am sure if it's mixed with regular milk, it would taste even better. This is a great way to get those healthy foods we never find time to eat throughout the day. The instructions say to have two to three times a day and that is a bit much for me. One every morning is plenty for me, IMO. …",44 out of 46 users found this review helpful

 A Poor Imitation,1,"I was delighted when I found this item and ordered it to replace my treasured old Melitta 6-cup porcelain drip pot that had been dropped and broken. The original pots were made in Germany and had a nicely sculptured shape. Most important was their uniquely designed spout with its small hole that prevented coffee from dripping down the side of the pot when it was poured. I don't know whether that spout design is patented and often wondered why its simplicity and effectiveness was never copied. The item that I received from Superstore was a very poor Chinese imitation of the original. I would have returned it but it is not returnable (buyers beware!). The shape of the pot is clumsy and thicker than the original. The spout drips when liquid is poured from it. Detailing of the filter is less refined and it may not work as well. Even the box with its ersatz Melitta logo is too small for the pot, lending evidence to my assumption that this pot was made in a factory with poor quality control and under the direction of someone who doesn't understand why people valued the design in the first place. Melitta introduced the pot as an inexpensive item with the apparent marketing strategy of using it to sell its filters. After they stopped producing it, the originals became collector's items. The one we broke recently was purchased used by my German aunt from a thrift store in Germany to replace one we had lost in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. I would have been satisfied with a good imitation from Superstore, but the one I received was a waste of money. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Our Top Choice Coffee,5,"When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types.

We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts. We do not prefer the weaker strengths. The Parisian Nights has great flavor and aroma with no bitterness. This is a great cup of coffee.

 Very pleased with this tea!,5,"I was hesitant to order this tea because there were only a few reviews at the time. One reviewer said the tea was ""tasteless"" and another cited poor packaging affecting the freshness. I'm glad I took the chance because I disagree on both counts. The taste is excellent which is, of course, the most important factor. I love strong, aromatic, flavorful tea and this does not disappoint. I had to add just a teeny bit more (a more rounded teaspoon for one cup) than with the tea I normally drink, Twinings Irish Breakfast, but that is insignificant since this Davidson's tea is half the price. I love that it is organic since I drink a lot of tea. I also thought the packaging was adequate. It is similar to the packaging used for the organic Ruta Maya coffee that I buy and I have never had a problem with freshness. Of course it is best to make sure you press out all of the air before resealing the top...I usually tap it on the counter to settle the contents then bend the top over on itself while leaning over on it, then seal it. As it reduces in size putting a rubber band around it helps just in case you didn't get the seal completely closed. I keep a small quantity of the tea in an old Twinings tin so that I don't have to open the original package so often. I am very happy to have found this tea. I still love the Twinings but it is just too expensive with three people in my family always drinking tea. …",20 out of 20 users found this review helpful
 Healthy RAW Snack,5,"Some people say these are a high fat , high calorie , high glycemic , glorified candybar. I say otherwise. Concerning fat, not all fats are equal , some being healthy . Since this bar is raw all of the fat,protein and sugar have not been denatured which means you get the full health benefit. As far as being high calorie , considering how nutrient dense these babies are I don't consider 200 calories high in calories at all. For me 200 calories is a perfect number allowing it to be used an nutrient dense snack or a quick meal on the go. Concerning these supposedly being high glycemic , sure , if you were to eat the dates in these by themselves it would be , but the nuts in them bring the glycemic load of the entire bar way down , which is another benefit of the healthy fats in these bars , it allows for the sugars to be released slower and for it to digest slower making you feel full and satisfied longer. As far as these not being any better than a candybar I say noway! No preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup , etc, in these babies , just a healthy combo of fruit and nuts. How many nutrients does a candybar have ? Now look at the nutrient in these , loaded with minerals . Also, unlike many other foods these aren't naturally low in nutrients and then ""fortified"" with man made vitamins and minerals to make them then appear healthy. All the nutrients in these are naturally occuring which gives you the benefits in a synergistic way where other healthy compounds such as flavonoids and phenols work together with naturally occurring vitamins and minerals. People need to let go of the old dogma which makes them think all fat is bad but if it's sugar free then it MUST be good. If that were true then cotton candy , pepsi and skittles would all be great for ya !Fruit and nuts makes for a good healthy breakfast or snack. I'll eat my greens/green smoothies in the other meals of the day. A person shouldn't eat only fruit and nuts during the day but they shouldn't only eat greens either . These bars help make it easy to strike a balance in your diet on the go. Larabars, Pure bars , SmartMonkey bars and ThinkOrganic bars are all healthy brands of raw bars that Superstore sells and all worth a try . Experiment and see what flavors you like best , or make your own ! …",264 out of 270 users found this review helpful

" A little confused, and very disappointed",1,"I purchased this product with very high hopes; a healthy, delicious snack in a variety of my favorite flavors. The reviews were absolutely astonishing, so I figured, what the heck. Wrong, wrong, wrong! Every popchip I tried had a very faint taste and smell of being burnt. Most of the flavors and seasonings are so weak that they don't come close to masking the taste. The end result? They tasted like water with 1/4th as much flavoring added or coke with a tall glass full of melted ice. Worst of all, the taste of burnt potatoes only accumulated as I ate more chips. I could not bear many of these in one sitting, and I hate to waste. There is, however, 1 exception. Barbeque flavor. These had a strong enough flavor to almost completely mask the burnt taste, and actually be quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, there was only 2 of those bags in this box (out of 12), so I still had 10 unbearable bags to consume. I sincerely wish this product was better, but there's clearly something wrong with their manufacturing process.

 Best AFFORDABLE Organic Formula on the Market,4,"Although any mom would prefer to feed their baby breast milk, there are circumstances that do not allow everyone to do so. I am stuck in that boat. So, I went on a quest to find the next best thing, organic formula. My son has been on Earth's Best formula since he was one week old and has no problems at all. Here is what I LIKE about Earth's Best: ORGANIC. I am very conscious about what I put in my own body so I wouldn't not have it any other way for my son. The use of pesticides and genetically modified ingredients is a terrifying concept to me. EB contains no growth hormones, antibiotics, steroids or potentially harmful pesticides or herbicides. EASY TO DIGEST. My son has no fussiness or issues with this formula. He's happy and content and has had no issues with gas or spitting up due to the formula. My son was a very colicky baby but we had tested out a few formulas before concluding that it was definitely not the EB causing his fussiness. AFFORDBILITY. Due to the recent recall of Similac organic formula, Earth's Best became the only affordable organic formula on the market that I could find readably available. The only other option available on the market besides Earth's Best is Only Organic Toddler Formula, Dairy Iron Fortified, 12.7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 3) and at nearly $30 for 3 cans of 12.7 oz of formula was out of our means. With Superstore subscribe and save, this formula is nearly the same price as non-organic formula. How could I even consider feeding my son anything else? These are the ISSUES I have with the formula: SYRUP SOLIDS. Sugar in formula? Excuse me! This is really disappointing but I believe the organic element of the formula far outweighs switching to a non-organic formula. As I said earlier, Baby Only is too expensive to even be an option for us. Plus, I believe the use of pesticides in formula ingredients is a far more dangerous concept than sugar! DHA/ARA. I am not a fan of the synthetically derived DHA/ARA found in EB formula. However, there are no affordable formulas on the market that have naturally derived DHA/ARA. Therefore, its hard to judge EB alone. The formula industry should be required to find a NATURAL way to derive DHA/ARA if it should be allowed to market their product as organic. CLUMPS. The formula can be hard to mix properly without getting clumps. It takes an extra amount of patience and time to mix this formula. The best solution I have found is to mix the formula in Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher or use a handheld formula mixer such as the Lionheart Versa Formula Mixer when making one bottle at a time. This way I do not get the bubbles that form from vigorous shaking. Although the EB formula is not perfect, it is the most affordable organic formula made on the market. However, if it is within your means, you may want to do a little bit of research on Baby Only formula. …",23 out of 24 users found this review helpful
 low cal and  low carb but low satisfaction too :(,2,"I was very excited to receive arctic zero but unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. I completely agree with another reviewer that said it tastes like a frozen protein shake...which isnt bad mind you but not worth the price in my opinion. I am not interested in eating the pints right from the freezer with a spoon but they do make a tasty breakfast when mixed with shake mix ins like fruit, milk, ice, cocoa, pb2 etc. Its not offensive at all, just not delicious and yummy. I like large portions and I'm health conscious ..so the volumetrics way of eating appeals to me... but in this case, I'd rather have a 1/2 cup of light ice cream than a pint of arctic zero.

Don't believe anybody who sells you a non-fat diet! Our body NEEDS fats to be healthy, and the right fats don't make you fat, to the contrary: you have energy, stamina and healthy body cells!

 A Godsend,5,"Thanks to a combination of Hi-Tor Neo Diet and Vita Gravy (and the sub-q fluids prescribed by the vet) my cat, who was given a diagnosis of advanced kidney failure and a certain impending death sentence two months ago, has amazed my vet and everyone in the vet's office. As a previous poster has already said, many renal failure cats are presribed the Hill's k/d or a/d diets and they absolutely hate it and won't eat it. My cat would not touch the stuff -- wouldn't even smell it -- I had to force feed him for weeks. I finally found the Hi-Tor Neo Diet, which is almost as low protein/phosphorous as the Hill's prescription diets. My cat loves it and is finally gaining back some weight. The vet had also prescribed some vitamin drops, which he also hates. Then I found ""Vita-Gravy"", which is also available at Pet Food Direct. He loves the taste of the Chicken Vita-Gravy mixed with the Hi-Tor Neo. Now he's getting the extra nutrition he needs to balance his blood levels, while really enjoying the taste! If your cat has renal failure and is refusing to eat, you might want to try this combo. Good luck! I hope your kitty fares as well as mine has so far. …",54 out of 55 users found this review helpful

 poor service from this company,1,"When I purchased this sauce to aid in my Atkins diet, it was shown CLEARLY to be a 6 pack. The title said it, the photo had one of those little text bubbles on it that said ""6 pack"" and the shipping weight was listed at like 5 pounds or something. TITLE AS LISTED: ""Walden Farms Sauce Barbecue Thick Calorie Free, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)"" One (1) bottle arrived, so I called the shipper who said the listing was wrong, and not their fault. They said Superstore writes the listing (Lies) and to contact them. I called Superstore, they said no, they couldn't possibly be responsible for the misprint on the ad, as they sell millions oof products for tens of thousands of companies, and each company writes their own ads for their own products. (Truth) and that I should make every attempt to resolve the conflict with the seller. After several more ""going nowhere"" calls with the supplier, they said the only way they would do anything is to submit it for resolution with Superstore, and I'd probably get my money partially refunded. Superstore ended refunding all of my purchase price and shipping. I can't wait to never buy from All Star Health , ever, ever again. I hope my review inspires you to look elsewhere as well. Bad, poor, lousy, unpleasant, untruthful customer service. By the way, the sauce is good, and I have since found it available in my local CUB Foods grocery store in their diabetic section. …",9 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 Good for cats - Loved by cats,5,"Approximately 20 years ago, I began to exclusively feed our cats Iams or Science Diet. Those brands were recommended by our Veterinarian after our first cat showed signs of Feline Urinary Syndrome (FUS). I had previously fed the cats the typical brands such as 9 Lives, Purina and Friskies. I continued with IAMS and Science Diet, because the other brands caused FUS, caused other digestive problems and the good reputation of IAMS and Science Diet. Then last year, one of our cats developed bladder disease and died. Not long afterward, the pet food scandal broke. Cat and dog food from nearly every pet food company, including premium foods like IAMS and Science, were tainted by melamine. More than 150 brands of cat and dog food were recalled. IAMS and Science Diet were two of the recalled brands, as was natural sounding brands such as Nutro. I vowed to never again purchase pet food from the brands that had betrayed my trust. I began searching for pet food that was all natural and organic. Newman's Own is both natural and organic. It was also one of the few brands not recalled. Although it was difficult to find a local source, I finally found a few, including Superstore. My cats love Newman's Own canned and dry food. They also love Innova EVO. I love it because I don't have to worry about tainted food poisoning my cats. Pros: 1. Peace of mind 2. Does not cause FUS, as did Purina and other similar brands 3. Much less likely to be tainted by lethal contaminants 4. The cats love it 5. Does not cause the other digestive problems. Cons: 1. It is more expensive than the non-premium brands 2. It can be difficult to find a nearby store that sells Newman's Own. Overall, the pros outweigh the cons. And I can now add Superstore to my list of sources for the food. …",70 out of 70 users found this review helpful
 Grateful,5,"This product saved my Dad's life! He had an incurable staph infection on his leg for 10 years that he caught from swimming in the ocean.

We thought he was going to die from it. I researched a cure for ""incurable staph"" on the internet and found this honey. He coated his leg with it and his sores were all heeled within a week! The infection may still be there but the sore are all gone. All he has now is some red spots. He no longer has to take pain pills every day, and he has not been back to the stupid doctors since.

 A GOOD WAY TO AVOID CAFFEINE?,3,"For some people, excessive coffee consumption can pose health problems or it might just make it hard to sleep at night or give them the jitters. ENTER ""Postum Caffeine Free Original, Instant Hot Beverage"", which has been around since the end of the 19th century. With Postum, the usual mistake is simply to start drinking it in place of coffee. The sharp contrast in taste and lack of caffeine often makes this a solution doomed to failure. A better method is to add some Postum to your coffee or to have the ""Postum"" at night if you can take the caffeine during the day and simply let your body tell you how much caffeine you are okay about replacing in this manner. Of course, you could apply the same approach with decaffeinated coffee, so it is a matter of taste. By itself, however, I find ""Postum"" very bland and unsatisfying. Nevertheless, I attempt to replace some of my coffee consumption in this manner every five years or so. …",7 out of 13 users found this review helpful

" Best flour of all, hands down!",5,"As an avid baker, I've tried just about every kind, brand and blend of flour out there. Whole wheat pastry flour tops the list. Even for people who think they won't like ""whole wheat"" because it sounds too health-food-y, think again. Every time I use this flour I get superior results and I've used it for everything: piecrust (the best!), muffins, cakes, as a thickener in sauces and soups and any other use for which a cook needs flour. One mixed flour product I've tried is labelled ""white/whole wheat flour"" and it cannot compare to real whole wheat pastry flour. True whole wheat pastry flour is more finely milled than traditional whole-wheat flour and has a light texture that always blends perfectly in recipes. Any serious cook needs to try using this flour, if you haven't done so yet. Prior to finding it on Superstore, I had to make trips to specialty health food stores and once bought a 50-pound sack just to avoid running out during our New England winters. Storage was a challenge, so finding smaller packages online is a wish come true! …",28 out of 28 users found this review helpful

 Great herbal tea!,5,"Good for your liver. My past couple blood tests for my physicals were showing borderline elevated levels of liver enzymes and CRP, so I was in search for some natural cleansing remedies. I believe this tea helped me. I have not yet recieved another blood test to confirm, but I do feel more energy at work. Whether or not its psychological, it works in my favor. As for CRP levels, it was a sign of inflammation in the body and I knew exactly where the pain was (my hands and feet). I have also been drinking Moringa tea (also recommended) but as far as I know the painful inflammation is almost gone. Before the tea, I was using prescription anti-inflammatory painkillers but now have put a hold on the medicine since I am feeling better. Was it the tea? Maybe, but the good part is that I'm not relying on meds. Only time will tell, but for those in doubt, this is a tea very well worth the investment if you are looking for a natural remedy of sorts. The taste and aroma is best described as nutty, kind of like roasted peanut brittle with hints of tahini or sesame. What I like about this tea is that the longer you let it brew the more robust the flavor and nutrients extracted. This way, I can just leave the tea bag in the kettle as I boil the water and also in my tea pot, unlike other teas like green tea which gets real bitter if you steep it too long. UPDATE 3.29.2012 *********** Since my first purchase, I have tried another brand, Tea Bags, Dandelion Root (Roasted), Caffeine Free, 30 tea bags (Pack of 3) and have found Traditional Medicinals better to my liking. It provides a more richer flavor and a smoother aftertaste in my experience. Plus, each tea bag is individually wrapped for freshness and includes the draw string. I find the best time to enjoy this tea is early in the day. The bold, robust flavor of this tea seems to trick my body into thinking its coffee. I can drink to my heart's desire (or perhaps liver) and not have to worry about caffeine. It's a greay way to get that invigorating fresh brew without the jitters. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Good Grits,5,"These grits are excellent. Superstore, in their product description says that ""hominy grits are coarsely ground hominy or corn"". That statement is incorrect. Hominy IS corn...that has the germ removed and is soaked in a weak lye solution. Grits made from hominy are superior to grits made from regular cracked corn. If you like grits, you will love this product from Angelina's Gourmet. One item missing from Superstore and Angelina is cooking instructions. Bring 1 1/4 cups of water to a low boil. Add 1/3 cups of grits. Turn heat to its lowest setting. You want the grits to barely simmer, not boil! Stir well and frequently for the first couple of minutes. Cover pan , removing to stir every couple of minutes. About 15 minutes will do it. The longer you can cook without going dry, the creamier the grits will be. Serving size? It's one serving for me, maybe two for you. You can figure this out......not rocket science. …",13 out of 13 users found this review helpful

 FINALLY a treat for my dog that lasts!,5,"I am so glad that I purchased this item for my dog. I have a golden retriever that is a very aggressive chewer. I cannot begin to count the number of toys, chews and/or treats I've bought for him that claim to be for aggressive chewers, only to be devoured or torn into shreds in less than an hour. I hesitated in purchasing this item because of the price (I'm obviously tired of brands not living up to their description) but I am very happy to say that my dog worked well over 4 hours before the treats were gone. He loved the taste of them and due to the design, they were challenging for him to get out so he really had to work on it. Another thing I liked was the fact that the ball itself isn't hard, but feels gel-like and that is appealing to him. This is by far one of the best things I've bought for him and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a dog that loves to chew! UPDATE: Still a challenge for my dog after many months...he has figured out how to pop out the treat but I now insert it upside down so that the treat is concave instead of convex and that has worked very well. …",14 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 AWESOME COCONUT OIL! AWESOME DEAL!,5,"Wow! I love this coconut oil! I have read about the wonders of coconut oil (increases metabolism, antiviral/antifungal/antibacterial properties, etc) and decided to start adding it to my daily diet. This brand is superb -- taste soooooo good and smells divine. I have used it on my toast and it could easily replace butter because the taste is buttery smooth and with very slight sweetness. The smell is not overwhelming and it's just very mild. Another plus is the price -- such a great deal for 32 ounces! I have looked around at different online and local stores for high quality coconut oil and the price cannot touch this, the only thing cheaper would be the low quality, rancid-smelling coconut oil being sold at local stores. Coconut oil will melt at 76 degrees, so I kept mine in the refrigerator to keep it solid. I've also used this as a moisturizer for my itchy and dry spots and works like a charm, easily melts when applied. I've divided mine for kitchen and body use -- simply wonderful!

 Two Paws Up!,5,"My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them. But I needn't have worried, they loved it!

 Great taste - poor packaging wastes k-cups,3,"I love the taste of this coffee. But apparently they have poor quality control. These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly. You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to. Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem. It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens. I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them.

I'm not a 'health nut' and I love good steak sauce. This is not it ! The stuff tastes like Kikoman on steroids. It is so salty that I couldn't deal with it. The bottle says an avg serving has 1200 MG of salt (sodium). That is more than HALF THE DAILY ALLOWANCE for someone with no heart problems, cholesterol, yadda yadda. This stuff is HEART ATTACK IN A BOTTLE ! It also has a bunch of MSG. I am not concerned because I think the MSG scare is a bunch of hoopla from the moonbat lefties crowd. If you're a moonbat type, be advised. My main complaint was the flavor. As I said it tastes JUST LIKE SOY SAUCE. Not my first choice to flavor a good steak.

" Light, flavorful, healthy and satisfying",5,"I'm a bit granola obsessed, always on the search for a great tasting and healthy blend of ingredients. With reasonable effort to avoid hyperbole, Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters might be the best granola I have tried. The diverse grains are sweet and crispy, the nutrients are plentiful, and the price is right. I generally eat the granola dry, straight from the package, but I have eaten it with almond milk, making for a delicious, nutritious breakfast. For those who are curious, here is a breakdown of the nutritional content, as well as ingredients: Serving Size: 1/3 cup (29g) Servings Per Package: About 11 Calories: 120 Calories from Fat: 30 Total Fat: 3g (5%) Saturated: 0g Trans Fat: 0g Cholesterol: 0mg Sodium: 20mg (1%) Total Carb.: 22g (7%) Dietary Fiber: 5g (20%) Sugars: 5g Protein: 3g INGREDIENTS: Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), citrus fiber, citrus pectin. The blueberry flavor is, perhaps, a little too subtle, getting lost in the mix of the grains, but it does make its presence known. The variety of grains included is more robust than many other brand I have tried, especially the inclusion of quinoa. So there is a little something to please everyone.

 Exceptional Rice!,5,I've tasted different rice varieties and this one is incomparable in taste and texture. Some of you may be skeptical but this special variety is short and plump but has a nice shine and not brittle when it is steamed. Also the texture is smooth as you eat it along with your favorite foods. Excellent for sushi. People who like their cooked rice a bit glutinuous will love this. …,15 out of 17 users found this review helpful
" best out there, still not perfect",4,"Of all the energy solutions out there, this is easily the best one. However, it still has its drawbacks. First, the PROs - Instant energy - Works almost immediately (within 1 minute for me) Not a lot of ""jitter"" - Many other energy bars and drinks give you that shaky feeling. This one does not No Crash - Its true, there is no crash. Though when you come back to your previous energy level, it might feel like a crash. A very positive energy - In addition to the physical energy you also get a very refreshing mental energy. It can almost be described as a very focused high. A feeling of clarity and motivation all at once Small amount goes a long way - I like that you dont have to drink a big 16 oz bottle of this stuff. Most energy drinks have a taste about as appealing as bath water. So, its nice to only have to drink an oz or two Now, for the CONS Taste - See above Thirst - I get very thirsty on this stuff. I always have to make sure to have a big bottle of water around Its addictive - The ""mental"" energy you get from this makes you want to do it all over again. Probably not for people with addictive personalities Big initial blast - The first 10 minutes for me are almost too much. I seem to want to do everything all at once.

" Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",6 out of 15 users found this review helpful

" Buyer beware, Proctor & Gamble has ruined this food!",1,"My girlfriend and I have been rescuing, fostering, and adopting out (through a rescue group) cats and kittens for over 10 years. We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy. So we're very experienced in all aspects of cat care, and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods. The foods are more expensive, but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions! We had been using Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food for several years, once we discovered that it included no by-products, corn filler, or other junk ingredients. Our cats loved the food, which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety. Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months. We heard that Proctor & Gamble, manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods, had purchased Natura Pet Products, maker of the Innova, Healthwise, and California Natural brands, among others. Proctor & Gamble reputedly still funds experimentation on domestic dogs and cats, so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way. So we were very upset about P&G's purchase of Natura, but we stuck with the Innova Cat & Kitten food for the short run, hoping we could later find a better alternative. Well strangely enough, for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat & Kitten that we've purchased, something has changed. The food is much more ""crumbly"", i.e. there is a lot more ""food dust"" in the bags, and the kibble looks a little different. We didn't think much of this change until our cats, which had previously LOVED the Innova food, lost interest in it and really didn't want to eat it. In the dry food mix we make, we noticed that very often, the cats would eat the other part of the mix, and leave the Innova Cat & Kitten behind. Clearly there is something different about the way P&G manufactures this food, as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products. This is EXPENSIVE food, and for the money you pay, it should be TOP QUALITY. Well, it ISN'T anymore! We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls (which are usually totally empty after feeding time), and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover, unwanted. So that was it; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat & Kitten to the store we'd purchased them from, and will never buy this food again. In fact, we've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products, which include Healthwise and California Natural. We did find a good quality alternative cat food called ""Simply Nourish"", and when we tried it with our cats, they LOVED it. There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls, and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality. WARNING: For anyone currently purchasing ""Innova Cat & Kitten"", or planning to buy it in the future, P&G appears to have changed the way this food is made, for the worse. We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money, and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market. AVOID this food, it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it did before P&G bought Natura Pet Products, and ruined it! …",18 out of 19 users found this review helpful
 True Cinnamon,5,I received the Real Cinnamon today! It is really great. It has a sweet aroma and a noticeably better and milder flavor than the cassia variety. I ordered this variety for health reasons although I will use it in cooking as well. Cinnamon is known to have therapeutic properties and can act as an anti-inflammatory. My acupuncturist has recommended that I take 1 tsp 2 x's a day with honey (I'm taking it with agave nectar). I have read that this variety of cinnamon (True Cinnamon) is much safer to take for these purposes and is a superior product from what is sold at the local super markets. I am extremely pleased with the products quality. Indus Organics delivered the cinnamon in a timely manner as well. I will most likely order this product from them again. …,13 out of 14 users found this review helpful
 Wok Mei Oyster Sauce,5,"I was led to this product after researching sodium hydroxide which was listed as an ingredient on a bottle of oyster sauce in the store. I didn't see the brand that I normally purchased and was looking for a substitute. After learning that there is a food grade sodium hydroxide and it is commonly found in fruit and vegetable washes, which I don't use, I decided that I wasn't interested in eating lye, food grade or not, and I started searching for a natural product and Wok Mei came up in the search results. Even though the oyster sauce that I normally used didn't list any unusual ingredients, the Wok Mei oyster sauce wins hands down in terms of flavor, and it has made a noticeable difference in my stir frys. I purchased mine directly from the Honest Foods website in search of a better price on shipping. This is one of my favorite veggie stir frys. Bok Choy Ingredients 1 tbsp vegetable oil 1 tbsp sesame oil 1 tsp freshly grated ginger 1 lb bok choy, sliced 1/4 cup water 2 garlic cloves, pressed or minced 1 tbsp oyster sauce 1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce 1 tbsp brown sugar 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, optional Directions Cut end off bok choy, keep stalks together and slice. Keep white stem pieces separate from green leafy pieces. The white pieces need to cook a little longer than the leaves. Keeping stem pieces and leaves separate, rinse and place in a salad spinner. Or rinse and drain in a colander and pat with a paper towel to remove some of the water. To make the sauce, combine water, garlic, oyster sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper flakes, if using, in a small bowl and set aside. Heat a 14"" wok or large skillet over medium high heat. Chen Traditional 14-Inch Flat Bottom Wok Set Combine the oil in a small bowl. Add ½ of the oil mixture to the wok and swirl around to coat sides. Stir in ginger. Quickly add white stem pieces to wok and stir fry 2 - 3 minutes or until pieces start to turn a pale green color and are slightly softened or are of desired tenderness. Stir or toss the pieces frequently. Add remaining oil to wok and add the leaves. Stir fry 1-2 minutes or until the leaves are wilted. Remove from heat and place bok choy in a serving dish. Pour the sauce into the wok. Cook over medium high heat 3 or 4 minutes or until the sauce is slightly thickened. Stir constantly to keep the sauce from burning.

" BAD, do NOT buy!",1,"Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!! Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling ""corn gluten meal"" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google ""U.S. Patent 5,030,268"" you will find out. By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier. Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food.

 A great base for my cat food blend,4,"I use Purina Cat Chow 3.5 pound bag of dry food as the base for my blend of four different foods for my two cats. I purchase these four bags, sit down with two large plastic containers and mix the four together. I keep them stirred so the four are well-blended. My two females love the taste of each of the four and they are getting the benefits of all four varieties (at least that is what my mind thinks).

Friskies Dental Diet for Cats (3.15-lb bag) Friskies Dental (I used Purina until the stores stopped carrying it), 3 lb Purina Cat Chow Healthful Life Adult Formula Dry Cat Food (3-lb bag) Purina Healthful Life Adult, 3 lb. While I am mixing, one cat who adopted me, prances around, licking her lips in anticipation, until I put out a few pieces for a taste (like a child licking the candy spoon). The other one who does not have food issues lies patiently yet thinks she is getting such a treat when I put out a few pieces for her. She likes the Dental flavor the best. When I finish and put out a fresh bowl of food and water, you talk about happy! The first one, Mizu, has snacked so much she eats just a few bites, then she's gone. Next Molly stretches and walks nonchalantly to the bowl and has her few bites. Cats are so cool! So are Purina and Friskies cat food!

" Smells good, but tastes like coffee-flavored water",3,"These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water.

 Get these if need a POWERFUL LAXATIVE,1,"I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch. They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects.

Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes. I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry. My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice. I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really. For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours. We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad. A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is. So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible. I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food. Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. …",18 out of 24 users found this review helpful
" The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization",5,"Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet. Yes they really are that good. I'm not in thrall of the whole ""organic"" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil. The person who came up with this ""red hot"" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented. It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head. It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will. I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones. …",29 out of 31 users found this review helpful
 Wonderfully Refreshing,5,I love this tea. I tried it initially at P.F changs restaurant and ordered it immediately after I found out what brand and flavor it was. It truly needs no sugar added just the wedge of a lemon. Trust me I'm a 24 year old who loves soda and sugar and I'm telling you this tea is perfect with just a wedge of lemon. Not only is it delicious but I've found that I lost a couple pounds because I'm drinking much less soda. Since the product description is lacking here is mine::: Be aware that this tea is lose leaf and doesn't come in tea bags. After doing some research on the web I found that the best way to brew the tea is as follows. Each plastic bag inside the box has 3/4 ounce of tea. This should make 3/4 gallon or 96 ounces. So all you need to do is bring to a boil half the amount or 48 ounces in a pot. Then let it sit off the burner for 2 minutes. Then add the pouch of loose leaf tea [3/4 ounce in total] and let it steep or brew for 7 minutes.... 10 minutes is too long and 5 minutes is too short. So set a timer it's important. After 7 minutes strain the water through a strainer with a paper towel layed in it. *** Make sure the bowl is beneath the strainer ***. Then put the strained liquid into a pitcher and add the remaining 48 ounces of tap water. Refridgerate and in an hour so should be good to go. In each of these boxes there are 24 3/4 ounces packages which will make a total of 18 gallons of iced tea. …,41 out of 41 users found this review helpful
 Our Top Choice Coffee,5,"When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types. We marked a rating of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating of one point meant ""Perfect, couldn't be better"", and five points indicated ""Don't like this one"". We rated one to nine cups of each of 30 coffees evaluated. Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top with the most number one ratings. We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts. We do not prefer the weaker strengths. The Parisian Nights has great flavor and aroma with no bitterness. This is a great cup of coffee. We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee. …",54 out of 54 users found this review helpful
 Inconsistent at best - too many hulls,3,"I enjoy hempseed, primarily I sprinkle it over my salads to add a nutty and nutritious component. I like buying this in bulk because it saves money over the expensive 1 pound or half-pound bags I can get at the store. My complaint about this product is that you never know what you'll get. Sometimes it's fairly free of hulls (seed coats) and sometime it's just full of them And they're hard to deal with - very hard pieces of shells that interfere with the enjoyment of whatever you are eating. I guess you could spend time separating the pieces out, but that is a labor-intensive process and at that point it becomes more economical (time is money) to buy the 1 pound or half-pound bag at the store from a company that pays more attention to what they are packaging. I kust got a new shipment and it is absolutely full of seed coat fragments. Grrrrr.... …",21 out of 21 users found this review helpful

" Great Noodles, but not spaghetti",5,"I lived in Japan for many years & really enjoyed using these ""noodles"" in soups, stir-fry, Korean-style cooking, etc. If you are looking for pasta, these may not exactly match your craving, but are nonetheless really versatile! My advice for those who don't like the smell upon opening the package is to drain them, sprinkle liberally with salt & rub through with clean hands, then rinse in cold water. This is how they prepare them in Japan - it removes any odor & they are ready to use. …",23 out of 23 users found this review helpful
 Whey't a minute!!!!,2,"First of all, let me say that I have been using whey low exclusively in my iced tea, and have totally replaced sugar in my kitchen with this product for several years. I thought is was great, and I can say that of it tastes indistiguishable from sugar. However, a few weeks ago my 12 year old son was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. We are supposed to count carbs in order to figure out how much insulin to give at each meal. When we used the effective carb count that the whey low product states on its packaging to figure carbs, his blood sugar shot up immediately. We have tried it several times with the same result. I have to conclude that this product is making false claims about effective carbs and being a low carb product. I won't be buying anymore. Sorry it took me so long to find out. It's probably why I couldn't lose weight even though I thought I was counting carbs all this time. …",61 out of 64 users found this review helpful
 DEADLY!!!!!,1,"I am writing this because this product KILLED my in-laws 2 year old YORKIE. They have been breeding Yorkies for 18 years and this was the first product they have used, that KILLED one of there dogs. They started using this product this past summer. Sweetie (the dog) was chewing on the GREENIE chew in front of both of them, when she started convulsing. They immediately took her a 1/2 mile to the vet, by the time they arrived there, Sweetie was DEAD. The Greenie had Pierced her TRACHEA.

 Contains GMOs! We say NO!,1,"Kellogg's Raisin Bran contains unlabeled genetically modified ingredients and Kellogg doesn't want you to know this. They contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California to try to trick people into voting against Prop. 37, which would require that genetically engineered foods be labeled. Raisin Bran contains GMO Bt corn and GMO sugar derived from GMO sugar beet. Both were developed and patented by chemical companies. GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide. It has been genetically engineered by forcing a foreign gene that makes its own pesticide into the plant DNA. Every cell of this plant is a pesticide factory. When corn worms bite into it, their stomachs explode. Both the sugar and the corn have foreign genes for herbicide resistance forced into their DNA. The plants are made to resist high levels of RoundUp. The active chemical ingredient in RoundUp, a chemical called glyphosate, has been linked to birth defects, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer and more. These GMOs have been snuck into our food supply without telling us. 50 countries around the world require that GMOs be labeled (including all of Europe, China, Russia, Japan, Australia, Brazil and India). In the US there is currently NO labeling law. The FDA does NOT require long term, peer reviewed studies to determine if GMOs are really safe. They let the chemical companies that patent these ""foods"" decide. How can this be when the FDA is there to protect us? WRONG. Just google Michael Taylor, Food Safety Czar and you'll see that he's setting food policy. When it suits him, he uses the revolving door to go back and forth between the FDA and the largest chemical company that is patenting and trying to monopolize our food supply. Should people be eating this stuff? I wouldn't feed it to my pets. My family is boycotting ALL Kellogg's products. …",7 out of 12 users found this review helpful
 MOST DISGUSTING THING ON THE PLANET!!!!,1,"Hi, first time reviewer here. Not because i never have an opinion, its just that i've never fully been moved to take time out of my day to give my two cents about something that someone is just going to read, ignore and go find out their own opinion anyway. But this seaweed snack that everyone is raving about is by far, bar none the nastiest bucket of yuck i have ever tasted in my entire life! it tastes like fermented ocean A**. Again i feel compelled to tell you the truth about this sea-garbage because every other review here is obviously someone who works for trader joe's and just trying to pitch the new product that they cant move off their shelves because there are no return customers. this seaweed snack has completely ruined my day and if it weren't for this beer in my hand to rid my tongue and nose of these rotting aromatics id probably take my own life just so that it would end. thank you for your time, and never buy this s***. …",9 out of 24 users found this review helpful

 Ovaltine has changed their formula,1,"Ovaltine has updated their packaging and changed their formula. The new formula is very similar to Nesquik. It no longer dissolves in the milk and stays dissolved, but settles on the bottom of the glass. This was the main reason I bought Ovaltine over Nesquik; it dissolved and stayed dissolved. The new formula is a real disappointment. …",25 out of 27 users found this review helpful
 Perhaps too compostable?,3,"I bought these bags to go with Trading ECO-2000 2.4 Gallon Kitchen Compost Waste Collector that I purchased on Superstore. The bags fit perfectly, but they seem to start degrading within a few days. If I took out compost every day, it would be fine, but I empty my compost bucket about twice a week. When I lift a bag to take it outside, it is dripping, so I have to take the whole bucket out and scrub it thoroughly afterwards to get rid of the odor. Previously, when I used a regular plastic shopping bag, leakage was almost never a problem, but it is a regular occurance with these liners. I like that the bags are biodegradable, but rather than purchasing these again, I'll probably go back to re-using plastic bags when my supply runs out--unless I find a sturdier brand. Any suggestions? …",20 out of 21 users found this review helpful

 This gum is really great!,5,"If you have problems with Aspartame (which is in every gum out there...not just sugarfree gums) and you love to chew gum then SteviaDent is really the only option unless you want to eat TicTacs. It is really good although quite expensive, but completely worth it to me so as not to compromise my health. I chewed every gum out there and lots of it, but had recently started to notice a painful lump on the roof of my mouth. My immediate reaction was...of course cancer, but I had 2 dentists and an oral surgeon check it out and all confirmed it was not. Not only that, Aspartame upset my stomach to the point that I had an extreme amount of bloating and gas every day. I didn't initially attribute either of these things to Aspartame, but when I started to notice the lump was bigger and more painful upon chewing my old gum, I started doing my research and Aspartame turned out to be the culprit. I ended up ordering a case of the SteviaDent and pitched everything I owned that contained Asapartame. The lump on the roof of my mouth disappeared within 2 days of not ingesting aspartame and my stomach bloating and gas completely went away. Worth spending the extra $ until more gums start making their product with Stevia instead of Aspartame. …",17 out of 17 users found this review helpful
 Cat Scratch Fever!!,5,"I opened up the cat scratcher, spread a little nip on and my cat went to town on it. He barely gave me a chance to set it up. He has used incline scratchers before so this was something he was familiar with. I would recommend trying to weigh down the scratcher if your cat is over 7 lbs. I just stuck a little 10lb weight inside the little hole in the back. They are more apt to use the scratcher if it doesn't move around on them while they are scratching away. I bought this online because the price was so much better. I bought the incline scratcher and 2 packages of refills for what it would have cost for just the incline scratcher at a local pet store. If you're cat doesn't take to it you can't really blame the scratcher. Cats are persnickety creatures. My cat loves the incline scratcher but will not go near the pole with the rope for scratching. The cat is happy, I'm happy and my furniture is spared. …",27 out of 27 users found this review helpful
